'''Aminoallyl nucleotide''' is a nucleotide with a modified base containing an [[allylamine]]. They are used in post-labeling of [[nucleic acid]]s by [[fluorescence]] detection in [[microarray]]. They are reactive with [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide]] ester group which helps attach a [[Fluorophore|fluorescent dye]] to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-amino[[allyl]])-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the [[pyrimidine]] ring of [[uracil]] or [[cytosine]]. The primary [[amine]] group in the aminoallyl moiety is [[aliphatic]] and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings ([[aromatic]]) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated with or without the lowercase "d" indicating [[deoxyribose]] if included or [[ribose]] if not. Finally the [[nitrogenous base]] and number of [[phosphates]] are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine [[triphosphate]]).

==History==
[[File:Heatmap using aminoallyl nucleotide.png|thumb|Hierarchically clustered heat map using aa-dUTPs&lt;ref name=microarraypic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Daniel J.|author2=Riordan, Daniel P. |author3=Gerber, André P. |author4=Herschlag, Daniel |author5= Brown, Patrick O. |title=Diverse RNA-Binding Proteins Interact with Functionally Related Sets of RNAs, Suggesting an Extensive Regulatory System|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e255|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060255|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0060255|accessdate=29 April 2014 |pmid=18959479 |pmc=2573929}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The goal of combining fluorescence and nucleic acids has been to provide a non-[[Isotopic labeling|isotopic]] tag that is detectable to study [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. This type of labeling allows scientists to study DNA or RNA in their structure, function, or formation with other nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kricka|first=LJ|author2=Fortina, P|title=Analytical ancestry: "firsts" in fluorescent labeling of nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids.|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=Apr 2009|volume=55|issue=4|pages=670–83|pmid=19233914|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.116152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first base modification for fluorescent labeling occurred in 1971 with a [[4-thiouridine]] and [[4-thiouracil]].&lt;ref name=Thio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Secrist III|first=John A.|author2=Jorge R. Barrio |author3=Nelson J. Leonard |title=Attachment of a fluorescent label to 4-thiouracil and 4-thiouridine|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=3 December 1971|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1262–1270|doi=10.1016/0006-291x(71)90154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research along with others, which included various types of direct and non-direct labeling via: [[Structural analog|analogs]], addition via enzymes, or other methods made labeling of nucleotides much safer for scientist to study DNA.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

As instrumentation and technologies become more advanced in the field of [[DNA microarray]], better reagents and techniques will be needed to further scientific studies. Fluorescent labeling with [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|Cy3]] was shown to be more insufficient and skew results; the method of aminoallyl nucleotide incorporation was opted instead. Using aminoallyl nucleotides as indirect fluorescent labeling seemed to nullify the sensitivity issues seen in [[Cyanine#Cy3 and Cy5|cyanine-labeling]].&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Robert|title=RNA Methodologies: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization|page=597|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OG2XubAE2BEC&amp;pg=PA597&amp;lpg=PA597&amp;dq=aminoallyl+nucleotides+beginning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7KfNkMaKj&amp;sig=TfBMiZdE63UrHriKuBJ-r4q0OgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9CFFU5zbO6amygHcqIFA&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aminoallyl%20nucleotides%20beginning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Aminoallyl [[nucleosides]] can be [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] via [[Heck coupling]] as shown in the image below.&lt;ref name=Synthesis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddington|first=Mark|author2=Daniel Cunninghan-Bryant|title=Convenient synthesis of (E)-5-aminoallyl-2′-deoxycytidine and some related derivatives|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=12 January 2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=181–183|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403910019490|accessdate=9 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2010.10.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heck coupling aminoallyl nucleotide reaction.jpg|Heck coupling aminoallyl nucleotide reaction]]

In the image above, on the left is a modified nucleoside with an [[iodine]] (the iodine is added via [[electrophilic halogenation]]) in the fifth carbon in the pyrimidine ring. Its formation can be associated with a reaction with an allylamine and various reagents via heck coupling are able to remove the [[halogen]] group from the base and add the allylamine to become the aminoallyl nucleoside shown on the right.&lt;ref name=Synthesis /&gt; The product on the right is then used to in [[molecular biology]] in RNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dUTP product information" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog" /&gt;

Other reactions include using a [[One-pot synthesis|single pot synthesis]] with other [[halogens]].&lt;ref name=floro_one_pot_syn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kore|first=Anilkumar R.|author2=Bo Yang |author3=Balasubramanian Srinivasan |title=Fluorous-assisted synthesis of (E)-5-[3-Aminoallyl]-uridine-5′-triphosphate|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=13 November 2013|volume=54|issue=46|pages=6264–6266|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403913015803|accessdate=9 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
The primary amine on the aminoallyl nucleotide reacts with amino-reactive dyes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeRisi|first=Joseph|title=Amino-allyl Dye Coupling Protocol|url=http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/data/pdfs/amino-allyl-protocol.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[cyanine]] and patented dyes&lt;ref name=hiyte&gt;{{cite web|last=AnaSpec, Inc|title=Hiyte Fluor Brochure|url=http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142441/http://www.anaspec.com/content/pdfs/c_literature168.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Tech - multi"&gt;{{cite web|last=life technologies|title=Aminoallyl dUTP|url=http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook/nucleic-acid-detection-and-genomics-technology/labeling-oligonucleotides-and-nucleic-acids.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contain a reactive leaving group, such as a succinimidyl ester ([[N-Hydroxysuccinimide|NHS]]).The amine groups directly attached to the ring of the base are not affected. These nucleotides are used for labeling DNA.&lt;ref name="RNA methodologies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dUTP product information" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hiyte /&gt;&lt;ref name="Life Tech - multi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Microarray /&gt;

[[File:Tagging modified uridine.jpg|Tagging modified uridine]]

==Uses==
Aminoallyl NTPs are used for indirect DNA labeling in [[PCR]], [[nick translation]], [[primer extension]]s and [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] synthesis.&lt;ref name="Trilink biotechnology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=DNA labeling|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cart/scripts/prodList.asp?idCategory=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs where they do not have the capacity to handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Modified Nucleotide catalog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biotechnology|first=Trilink|title=Modified Nucleotides|url=http://www.trilinkbiotech.com/work/ntps.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA [[polymerase]], 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.
aa-NTPs incorporated into DNA/RNA in combination with a secondary dye coupling reagents can probe for an array analysis.&lt;ref name="dUTP product information"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biosystems|first=Applied|title=Modified Nucleotide 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP|url=http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/sp_8436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cDNA relies on aminoallyl labeling for detection purposes. Although direct labeling of dNTP is the quickest and cheapest method of fluorescent labeling, it is disadvantageous as the sequence allows for only one modified nucleotide for use. Another disadvantage of direct labeling is the bulky nucleotides, however this can be overcome by indirect labeling using aminoallyl modified nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibriel|first=Abdullah|title=Options available for labeling nucleic acid samples in DNA micro-array-based detection methods|journal=BRIEFINGS IN FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS|date=17 April 2012|volume=II|issue=4|pages=311–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy way to check for labeling success is the color;Good labeling will result in visible blue (Cy5) or red (Cy3) color in the final material.&lt;ref name="A laboratory Manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Molecular Cloning-A Laboratory Manual|url=http://www.molecularcloning.com/index.php?prt=112|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Process of preparing amino allyl-labelled cDNA.jpg|thumb|Process of preparing amino-allyl labeled cDNA]]

Another process which uses aminoallyl labeling is [[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]] ( Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), a highly sensitive technique for amplifying RNA. In this specific case, the aaUTP modified RNAs were tagged with fluorescent market Cy3. NASBA combined with aminoallyl-UTP labeling is very useful for many different areas of microbial diagnostics including environmental monitoring, bio threat detection, industrial process monitoring and clinical microbiology.&lt;ref name=NASBA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ott|first=Scheler,|author2=Barry Glynn|title=Fluorescent labeling of NASBA amplified tmRNA molecules for microarray applications|journal=BMC Biotechnology|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA microarray is another method which utilizes specifically AA-NTP's making DNA microarray testing quicker and cheaply.&lt;ref name=Microarray&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang|first=CC|author2=Kozhich, OA|author3=Chen, M|author4=Inman, JM|author5=Phan, QN|author6=Chen, Y|author7= Brownstein, MJ|title=Amine-modified random primers to label probes for DNA microarrays.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 2002|volume=20|issue=7|pages=738–42|pmid=12089562|doi=10.1038/nb0702-738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-synthesis labeling avoids the problems found in direct enzymatic incorporation of Cy-labeled dNTPs by generating probes with equal labeling effectiveness. With indirect labeling, amine-modified NTPs are incorporated during [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]], RNA amplification, or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. Amino allyl-NTPs are incorporated with similar efficiency as unmodified NTPs during polymerization.&lt;ref name="cRNA Better"&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hoen|first=PA|last2=de Kort |first2=F |last3=van Ommen |first3=GJ |last4=den Dunnen |first4=JT|title=Fluorescent labelling of cRNA for microarray applications.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Mar 1, 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=e20|pmid=12595569|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/nar/gng020|pmc=149842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaposi-Novak|first=P|author2=Lee, JS|author3= Mikaelyan, A|author4= Patel, V|author5= Thorgeirsson, SS|title=Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA targets from linear RNA amplification.|journal=BioTechniques|date=Oct 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=580, 582–6, 588|pmid=15517970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns with labeling:
The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is reactive with dyes such as the cyanine series, or other patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with [[buffering agents]] which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer can be used to overcome this problem.&lt;ref name="concerns with labeling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soundy|first=P|first2=C. |last2=Wheeler |first3=H. |last3=Latham |title=Preparing highly fluorescent, evenly labelled probes for microarray hybridization using the amino allyl method with CyScribe Post-Labelling Kit|journal=Life Science News|volume=9|pages=17–19|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioconcentration]] is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=|date=|title=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F1-4020-4494-1_31|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.

[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.

Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as "[[red tide]]s" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.

Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.
Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.
Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of [[Vitamin A]], which becomes concentrated in [[carnivore]] [[liver]]s of e.g. [[polar bear]]s: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of Vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic [[explorer]]s have suffered [[Hypervitaminosis A]] from eating the bear livers (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of [[Xavier Mertz|Antarctic explorers]] eating [[husky]] [[dog]] livers).  One notable example of this is the expedition of [[Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.

[[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic puffin]]) are often monitored for [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] bioaccumulation.

In some eutrophic aquatic systems, [[biodilution]] can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to "dilute" the concentration of the pollutant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2882">The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE's) '''Building Energy Codes Program (BECP)''' was established in 1991 (originally called the Building Standards and Guidelines Program), with its activities defined by the Energy Conservation and Production Act (ECPA) (Pub. L. No 94-385),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title42/pdf/USCODE-2011-title42-chap81-subchapII.pdf U.S. Code: Title 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE, CHAPTER 81 - ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RESOURCE RENEWAL]&lt;/ref&gt; as amended, and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) (Pub. L. No 110-140).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These statutes direct  DOE to participate in industry processes to develop model building energy codes, issue determinations as to whether updated codes result in energy savings, and provide technical assistance to states to implement and comply with the codes. The BECP is part of DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [http://energy.gov/eere/efficiency/buildings Building Technologies Office].

==Program Areas==
BECP focuses on three key building energy code areas: model code development, adoption, and compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energycodes.gov/ Building Energy Codes Program website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model Code Development===
DOE is directed by statute to review the technical and economic basis of building energy codes and participate in processes for their review and modification, including adoption of all technologically feasible and economically justified energy efficiency measures.

===Adoption===
DOE is directed by statute to provide technical assistance to states implementing building energy codes, including the adoption of all technologically feasible and economically justified efficiency measures, as well as encouraging states to adopt updated building energy codes.

===Compliance===
DOE is directed by statute to provide technical assistance to states implementing energy codes.

The '''Chemistry Quality Eurolabels''' or '''European Quality Labels in Chemistry''' ('''Labels européens de Qualité en Chimie''') is a marketing scheme for chemistry degrees at institutions located within the 45 countries involved in the [[Bologna process]]. Labels are awarded to qualifying institutions under the names are '''Eurobachelor''' and '''Euromaster''', as well as the proposed '''Eurodoctorate'''. [[Label Committee]] not only prepares for the [[ECTN Administrative Council]] proposals to award the [[Eurolabels]] but also judge the quality of chemical education programmes at [[Higher education|HEIs]]. [[ECTN]] and its [[Label Committee]] closely collaborates with [[EuCheMS]] and [[American Chemical Society]].

It is a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] which is supported by [[EuCheMS]], and the labels are awarded by [[ECTN]]. The project is supported by the [[European Commission]] (EC) through its [[SOCRATES programme]]. The purpose of the framework is to "promote recognition of [[first cycle degree|first]], [[second cycle degree]]s, and [[third cycle degree]]s not only within the 45 countries involved in the [[Bologna process]]".

==History==
[[European Union]] promoted the [[Bologna process]] and the creation of a single [[European higher education area]], both of which require mobility of graduates across Europe.

[[ECTN]] ([[European Chemistry Thematic Network]]) worked in the EU project "[[Tuning Educational Structures in Europe]]" and developed [[Eurobachelor]], a framework for a [[first cycle qualification]] ([[Undergraduate degree|first degree]]) in [[chemistry]]. [[EuCheMS]] approved Eurobachelor in October 2003.&lt;ref name="eubach"&gt;Mitchell T.N., Whewell R.J.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-eurobachelor_documentation-150613.pdf The Chemistry "Eurobachelor®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004 the [[Bologna process seminar]] "[[Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area]]" approved Eurobachelor.&lt;ref name="eubach"/&gt;

==Eurobachelor==
'''Eurobachelor''' is a [[registered trademark]] and an initiative adopted by the [[EuCheMS]] General Assembly in 2003. It is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 60 Eurobachelor quality labels have been awarded. The label is intended for [[first cycle qualification]]s ([[bachelor's degree]]s).

Eurobachelor is based on 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation|ECTS]] ([[European credits]]), which is comparable to the three-year British degrees, but it does not include the British concepts of [[honours degrees]] and [[ordinary degree|ordinary degrees.]]&lt;ref name="eubach" /&gt;

==Euromaster==
'''Euromaster''' is a [[registered trademark]] and an initiative adopted by the [[EuCheMS]] General Assembly in 2005. It is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 36 Euromaster quality labels have been awarded. The label is intended for [[master's degree]]s.

Euromaster, introduced after Eurobachelor, is intended for [[second cycle qualification]]s ([[postgraduate degree]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell T.N.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-euromaster_documentation-150101.pdf The Chemistry "Euromaster®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurodoctorate==
'''Eurodoctorate''' is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 1 Eurodoctorate quality label was awarded. The label is intended for [[third cycle qualification]]s (i.e. [[doctoral degree]]s).&lt;ref name="eudoc"&gt;Mitchell T.N., Varella V.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-doctorate_eurolabel_documentation-150101.pdf Designing European Third Cycle Programmes in Chemistry - "Chemistry Doctorate Eurolabel®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tuning Chemistry Subject Area Group]] ([[Tuning SAG]]) discussed with a working party of [[ECTN]] ([[European Chemistry Thematic Network]] Association) in a meeting held in February 2006 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], taking into account the declarations of the [[Bergen Communiqué 2005]]. The [[EHEA Overarching Framework]], which was approved by the Ministers of Education of [[European Union member state]]s in [[Bergen]] uses the [[Dublin descriptors]] and Tuning SAG decided to use the Dublin descriptors to form a new set of descriptors, the [[Budapest descriptor]]s for third cycle qualifications.&lt;ref name="eudoc"/&gt;

The [[Chemistry Eurodoctorate Framework]] version 1 was published in November 2006.

It focuses on the research and education in the field of information and communications and enjoys a nationwide reputation in the study of posts, telecommunications and information technology, especially for its research and commercialization in 3G mobile technologies, optical sciences and related digital research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtriangle.com/thetriangle_march2011_feature Comments on CQUPT by CEO of Canada's Technology Triangle Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928210543/http://www.techtriangle.com/thetriangle_march2011_feature |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the four universities of Posts and Telecommunications in China and the only one of its kind in the Southwest China. It enjoys a very good reputation in the ICT industry in China due to its high quality education and research and the large number of alumni working in the ICT industry. Due to its achievements and contributions in the field of Information and Communications, especially in the development of China's own digital communications systems, CQUPT is considered as the cradle of China's digital communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.php Introduction of CQUPT on its website, paragraph 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People's Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan Province as a Municipality in 1997).

In 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Chinese Central Government with the Chongqing government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by Ministry and Province (Municipalities) government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/lsyg.php History of CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
CQUPT has 15 schools and institutes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/english/index.php Schools in CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt; with  the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor established in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deptweb.cqupt.edu.cn/xwzx/news.php?id=8876 Press release on the establishment of Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Overview===

CQUPT is the origin of the China's digital communications systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/english/index.php Brief introduction to CQUPT's research on its website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the very recent years, over 600 scientific projects in the ICT field have been done in the university and 80 of them were granted the "Scientific Research Achievement Awards" by the government. CQUPT is the only Chinese university participating in the development of China's own 3G standard: TD-SCDMA.

The world's first TD-SCDMA chip and mobile phone were developed at CQUPT. The university played a key role in the establishment of China's first national "EPA Communication Standard for Industrial Measurement and Control System", which was recognized by the IEC as international standard in the field of industrial automation. The university's spin-off company [https://web.archive.org/web/20120326025835/http://www.cqcyit.com.cn/en/ Chongqing CYIT Communications Technologies Company (CYIT)] is among the first companies doing research on TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE in China and is already a frontrunner in the field nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqcyit.com.cn CYIT's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315181614/http://www.cqcyit.com.cn/ |date=2012-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's strength also lies in areas such as computer science, automatic control technology, microtechnologies, and others, as one of the first academic institutions doing research in these fields in China.

Research at CQUPT is done in about 30 research platforms. Each of the research platforms may contain several laboratories or research groups. Research at CQUPT is closely linked to the industry. In 2010, the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor, which is in and hosted by CQUPT, was founded with the participating of nearly 50 partners in industry from around the world, including Qualcomm in USA, Eplida in Japan, the International Association of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials European Microelectronics Center in Taiwan among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5668">'''Corticocortical Coherence''' is referred to the synchrony in the neural activity of different cortical brain areas. The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[Electrocorticography|ECoG]], etc.). It is a method to study the brain's neural communication and function at rest or during functional tasks.

== History and Basics ==
Initial applications of spectral analysis for finding the relationship between the EEG recordings from different regions of scalp dates back to 1960's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=D. O.|date=1963-08-01|title=Spectral analysis for electroencephalograms: mathematical determination of neurophysiological relationships from records of limited duration|journal=Experimental Neurology|volume=8|pages=155–181|issn=0014-4886|pmid=20191690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corticocortical coherence has since been extensively studied using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recording for potential diagnostic applications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sklar|first=B.|last2=Hanley|first2=J.|last3=Simmons|first3=W.

The exact origins of corticocortical is under active investigation. While the consensus suggests that the functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by neural tracts, in either direct or indirect way),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Xu|last2=Wu|first2=Taoyu|last3=Valdes-Sosa|first3=Pedro|date=2015-01-01|title=Incorporating priors for EEG source imaging and connectivity analysis|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00284/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00284|issn=1662-453X|pmc=4539512|pmid=26347599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|title=Computational Neuroscience|last=Ramírez|first=Rey R.|last2=Wipf|first2=David|last3=Baillet|first3=Sylvain|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9780387886299|editor-last=Chaovalitwongse|editor-first=Wanpracha|series=Springer Optimization and Its Applications|pages=127–155|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|editor-last2=Pardalos|editor-first2=Panos M.|editor-last3=Xanthopoulos|editor-first3=Petros}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=B.|last2=Liu|first2=Z.|date=2008-01-01|title=Multimodal Functional Neuroimaging: Integrating Functional MRI and EEG/MEG|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4664427/|journal=IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|volume=1|pages=23–40|doi=10.1109/RBME.2008.2008233|issn=1937-3333|pmc=2903760|pmid=20634915}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occur at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=Arnaud|last2=Palmer|first2=Jason|last3=Onton|first3=Julie|last4=Oostenveld|first4=Robert|last5=Makeig|first5=Scott|date=2012-02-15|title=Independent EEG Sources Are Dipolar|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e30135|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3280242|pmid=22355308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corticocortical coherence has been of special interest in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (commonly used for [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] studies).

==  Methods, Mathematics and Statistics ==
Cortico-cortical coherence is commonly studied using bipolar channels of EEG recordings, as well as unipolar channels of EEG or MEG signals; however, unipolar channels are usually used to estimate the brain sources and their connectivity, using electrical source imaging and connectivity analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehrkanoon|first=Saeid|last2=Breakspear|first2=Michael|last3=Britz|first3=Juliane|last4=Boonstra|first4=Tjeerd W.|date=2014-09-17|title=Intrinsic Coupling Modes in Source-Reconstructed Electroencephalography|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/brain.2014.0280|journal=Brain Connectivity|volume=4|issue=10|pages=812–825|doi=10.1089/brain.2014.0280|issn=2158-0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use [[Coherence (signal processing)|Coherence]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., Rosenberg, J. R., Amjad, A.

Statistical significance of coherence is found as function of number of data segments with assumption of the signals' normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., &amp; Rosenberg, J. R. (1999).

'''Dennis Vincent Brutus''' (28 November 1924&amp;nbsp;– 26 December 2009) was a [[South Africa]]n activist, educator, journalist and poet best known for his campaign to have South Africa banned from the [[Olympic Games]] due to its controversial racial policy of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dennis-brutus | title = Dennis Brutus South Africa Online | accessdate = 2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Salisbury (Rhodesia)|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] to South African parents, Brutus was of indigenous Khoi, Dutch, French, English, German and Malaysian ancestry. His parents moved back home to [[Port Elizabeth]] when he was aged four, and young Brutus was classified under [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] racial code as "coloured".&lt;ref name="DBT01"&gt;[https://books.google.lu/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC "The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography"], ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brutus was a graduate of the [[University of Fort Hare]] (BA, 1946) and of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], where he studied law. He taught English and [[Afrikaans]] at several high schools in South Africa after 1948, but was eventually dismissed for his vocal criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith A. P. Sandiford]], ''A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora'', [[Hansib Publications]], 2008, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the faculty of the [[University of Denver]], [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University Course Bulletin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bond&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/brutus261209.html |title=Dennis Vincent Brutus, 1924–2009 |publisher=mrzine.monthlyreview.org |accessdate=2009-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/tags/dennis_brutus |publisher=''Democracy Now!'' |title=Dennis Brutus |accessdate=26 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/world/africa/03brutus.html?hpw "Dennis Brutus Dies at 85; Fought Apartheid With Sports"], ''The New York Times'', 2 January 2010 (3 January 2009, p.

In 2008, Brutus was awarded the Lifetime Honorary Award by the South African Department of Arts and Culture for his lifelong dedication to African and world poetry and literary arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Poetry-and-Protest-A-Dennis-Brutus-Reader ''Poetry and Protest: A Dennis Brutus Reader''].

[[File:Dennis Brutus (1967).jpg|thumbnail|left|Dennis Brutus during a press conference at Schiphol Airport, 1967]]

===Activist===
Brutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1960s. He learned politics in the [[Trotsky]]ist movement of the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dennis+Brutus:+a+memorial+statement.-a0219588353|title=Dennis Brutus: a memorial statement. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between [[Black people|blacks]] and [[coloureds]].

Brutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that would be heavily influential in the banning of [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics]] in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC.  As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"&gt;George Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain: Glimpses of Africa's Freedom Struggle''(New York: Pilgrim Press, 1989), 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and jail===
In 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his "banning," which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he "jumped bail" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while in [[Mozambique]], on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to [[Robben Island]] ... for 16 months, five in solitary." He was in the cell next to [[Nelson Mandela]]'s. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]], for which he had campaigned, broke.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;

Brutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, ''Sirens, Knuckles and Boots'', was published in [[Nigeria]] while he was in prison. The book received the [[The Mbari Club|Mbari Poetry Prize]], awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of 14 books.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

===Release from jail===
After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in the  [[United Kingdom|Britain]],where he first met [[George Houser]], the Executive Director of the [[American Committee on Africa]] (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour; where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organizations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defense of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa  which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games.  In cooperation with SANROC, the ACOA organized a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  [[Jackie Robinson]], the first African American athlete to break to color barrier in [[Major League Baseball]], published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. Asa result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Announcing Dennis Brutus," found at: http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-B92 [accessed on 27 October 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Statement by Jackie Robinson and K.C.

In 1983, Brutus won the right to stay in the [[United States]] as a political refugee, after a protracted legal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Clendenin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/us/black-poet-an-exile-for-10-years-battles-us-deportation-to-africa.html "Black poet, an exile for 10 years, battles U.S. Deportation to Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 14 January 1982.

===Return to South Africa, poetry and activism===
He returned to South Africa and was based at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]], where he often contributed to the annual [[Poetry Africa]] Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with [[NGO]]s. 
In December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. 
At the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: 

{{quote|It is incompatible to have those who championed racist sport alongside its genuine victims. It's time—indeed long past time—for sports truth, apologies and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Weekly'', 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to fellow writer [[Olu Oguibe]], interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the [[University of Connecticut]], "Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]] and [[Christopher Okigbo]], certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher."

Brutus died of [[prostate cancer]] on 26 December 2009, at his home in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7edc02ba-f73d-11de-9fb5-00144feab49a.html |title=Poet, political prisoner and a campaigner to the end |publisher=www.ft.com|author= Martin, Jurek|date=2 January 2010&lt;!-- 02:00 --&gt;|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">[[File:Guioa_acutifolia_leaflet_detail_Kewarra_4493.jpg|thumb|right|A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of ''[[Guioa acutifolia]]'']] [[File:Eriophyoid in Camphor Domatium.JPG|thumb|right|[[Eriophyoidea|Eriophyoid]] inside domatium of ''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'']] [[File:Yellow mite in Camphor domatium.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mite]] inside domatium of ''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'']]
A '''domatium''' (plural: '''domatia''', from the Latin "domus", meaning home) is a tiny chamber produced by plants that houses arthropods.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=O'Dowd |first=Dennis J. |author2=Mary F. Willson |date=June 1991 |title=Associations Between Mites and Leaf Domatia |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=179–182 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90209-G}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ideally domatia differ from [[gall]]s in that they are produced by the plant rather than being induced by their inhabitants, but the distinction is not sharp; the development of many types of domatia is influenced and promoted by the inhabitants. Most domatia are inhabited either by [[mites]] or [[ants]], in what can be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relationship, but other arthropods such as [[thrips]] may take parasitic advantage of the protection offered by this structure. 

Domatia occupied by ants are called '''myrmecodomatia'''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O., The Insect Societies,  Publisher: Belknap Press 1971, {{ISBN|978-0-674-45490-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important class of myrmecodomatia comprise large, hollow spines of certain acacias such as ''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', in which ants of the genera ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' and ''[[Tetraponera]]'' make their nests. Plants that provide myrmecodomatia are called '''[[myrmecophyte]]s'''. The variety of the plants that provide myrmecodomatia, and the ranges of forms of such domatia are considerable. Some plants, such as ''[[Myrmecodia]]'', grow large bulbous structures riddled with channels in which their ants may establish themselves, both for mutual protection and for the nutritive benefit of the ants' wastes.

Often domatia are formed on the lower surface of leaves, at the juncture of the midrib and the veins.  They usually consist of small depressions partly enclosed by leaf tissue or hairs.  Many members of the [[Lauraceae]] family develop leaf domatia.  Domatia are also found in some rainforest tree species in the families [[Alangiaceae]], [[Elaeocarpaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Icacinaceae]], [[Meliaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], [[Sapindaceae]] and [[Simaroubaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30613">In 1957, the research organization of the Chemicals Department of [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] was renamed '''Central Research Department''', beginning the history of the premier scientific organization within DuPont and one of the foremost industrial laboratories devoted to basic science.  Located primarily at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]] and Chestnut Run, in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], it has expanded to include laboratories in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], [[Seoul, South Korea]], [[Shanghai, China]], and [[Hyderabad, India]]. In January, 2016 a major layoff marked the end of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Jan. 25, 2016, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company established a tradition of basic scientific research starting with hiring of [[Wallace Carothers]] in 1928 and his systemization of polymer science that led to the development of polyamides such as nylon-6,6 and polychloroprene (neoprene) in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes, Matthew. Enough for One Lifetime, Wallace Carothers the Inventor of Nylon, Chemical Heritage Foundation, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8412-3331-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This tradition waned during [[World War II]] then underwent a renaissance in the 1950s.  The establishment of Central Research in 1957 formalized a corporate commitment to basic research.  The execution and publication of high quality research assisted recruiting and promoted the image of DuPont while raising morale among the CRD staff.  The purpose of the research was to discover "the next [[nylon]]", because Carothers' success and the resulting commercialization of nylon had driven the Company's profits through the 1950s.  (This research objective that was never met.)  Nonetheless, another important stated goal for CRD was “diversification through research,” and CRD produced a stream of scientific innovations that contributed to many different businesses throughout the corporation.

CRD combined industrial and fundamental research, and the mix of the two features was often determined by the head of CR&amp;D.  The title expanded from Director of Research to Vice President of Technology to Chief Technology Officer with varying degrees of impact on research throughout the corporation as well as in CRD.  The name of CRD also changed to reflect the times, starting with Chemicals Department and moving through Central Research Department (CRD), Central Research and Development Department (CR&amp;DD), to the present Central Research and Development (CR&amp;D).

CRD conducted research in a number of topical areas, often requiring an interdisciplinary approach.  DuPont’s explored chemical reactions in supercritical water in the 1950s to support its production of CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for [[magnetic recording]] tapes.  Hyperbaric recrystallization of ultra-high molecular weight [[polyethylene]] led to DuPont’s business in Hylamer polyethylene for bearing surfaces in hip and knee replacement [[arthroplasty]].  [[Urea]] and [[uracil]] compounds discovered in CRD were potent and selective [[herbicides]], propelling DuPont into the agricultural chemicals business and culminating in sulfonylurea herbicides.  [[Potassium titanyl phosphate]] or KTP is a versatile [[nonlinear optical]] material, originally designed to [[frequency doubling]] red [[laser]]s to green for bloodless laser eye surgery; it now find additional application in urological surgery and hand-held green [[laser]] pointers.

In the 1950s, the CRD housed a broad-based research program aimed largely at the synthesis and study of new classes of compounds.  Synthesis of new organic and inorganic compounds accounted for about half of the total research.  When the [[National Institute of Health]] invited DuPont to submit compounds to its screening efforts, they rated DuPont as submitting by far the most diverse range of compounds – pharmaceutical companies were submitting things that looked like pharmaceuticals, but DuPont submitted compounds that would be classed internally as catalysts, optical materials, monomers, oligomers, ligands, inorganics, and other unusual materials.

In addition to chemical synthesis, CRD maintained efforts centered on new physical and analytical techniques, chemical structure and reaction mechanism, and solid-state physics.  DuPont continued in polymer research.  Biological research has increased significantly.

Until recent years, a substantial portion of research was of an academic nature.  This academic research was reflected in the general atmosphere of the organization.  In the late 1960s, CRD established a program for recruiting [[postdoctoral]] fellows.  These fellowships were generally for two years and had the expectation that the fellow would leave to an academic institution.  Every year one or two DuPont scientists would take one year leaves of absence for university study and teaching.  It was also accepted that every year a number of scientists would leave DuPont for academic positions and that several professors would join the staff permanently.  A notable example was [[Richard Schrock]], who left CRD for [[MIT]] and won the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]].  CRD was supported by numerous high-profile consultants who have made significant contributions to DuPont.  [[John D. Roberts|Jack Roberts]] of [[Caltech]] and [[Carl Shipp Marvel|Speed Marvel]] each consulted for well over 50 years and provided a steady supply of well-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Howard's  DuPont patents span a period of over 50 years. From Edward G. Howard, Jr., ''Catalyst system of bromate ion-sulfoxy compounds for use in aqueous polymerization processes'', US  2560694 (1951) through Dennis Edward Curtin, and Edward George Howard, ''Compositions containing particles of highly fluorinated ion exchange polymer'' US7166685 B2 (2007), with about 100 patents between.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Robert Grubbs]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] with Schrock, consulted for many years.  These academic connections were sources of new generations of CRD researchers.

The scientific accomplishments of [[Theodore L. Cairns]], [[William Dale Phillips|William D. Phillips]], [[Earl Muetterties]], [[Howard E. Simmons, Jr.]], and [[George Parshall]] were recognized by their election to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].

CRD management fostered an open and collaborative style.  At its founding, the division of labor in CRD was “management,” “bench chemists,” and “technicians,” with the management and bench chemists having separate but overlapped promotional tracks.  Under the [[Hay Grade]] system of pay levels that was employed then and now, there were eight professional or promotional levels for the “bench chemists,” yet there was a single undistinguished title.  This approach promoted interaction.

The Hay Grades for those in management started higher and ended considerably higher, but there was significant overlap with the bench chemist levels.  Thus it was not unusual for a supervisor or manager to have one or more scientists reporting to him (there were no females in management at this time) who were at higher pay levels than he was.  There was one reported instance where the supervisor never got to pass pay raises to the “bench chemist” because management didn’t want to make him feel bad; the next level Manager who did pass on the pay notification said, “They didn’t care how I felt.”  Titles explicitly tied to salary level were instituted in May, 1993, but the openness remains today as does the situation of Managers managing higher level scientists.

At the beginning of CRD, “technicians” in CRD were usually high-school educated and often had military service.  They were clearly just extra hands for the bench chemists who were all PhDs and the bench chemists were expected to spend most of their time at the bench.  It was virtually impossible for a technician to progress in CRD, but they could at plant sites and would sometimes move for the opportunity.  Starting in the early 1990s, mostly as a result of the growth of the pharmaceutical and life science efforts, technicians with [[Bachelors]] degrees and later, [[Master's degree]]s became the norm.  There are even some technicians holding PhDs from foreign universities.  Nonetheless, it remains difficult for a technician to break into the bench chemist ranks and they usually transfer to business units in search of more opportunity.

Many of the PhDs who came to CRD transferred to business units.  From the 1980s to early 90s, management tried to move all PhDs to a business unit within their first five years.  The PhDs had spent their entire lives in an academic environment, so they knew nothing else, but it was realized that at some point they would grow up and realize that working at the bench was not what some of them would want to do their entire career.  The issue was that they were too senior and naive to move into entry level positions in businesses and their competition were similarly aged BS engineers who would have had about five years of experience keeping a plant running.  Of those who took the opportunity, about half returned to CR&amp;D.  Of those who returned, about half left again.  The relatively high turnover provided more opportunity for CRD to hire outstanding new PhDs.  Transfers to business units became less common in the 1990s and the average age of CRD personnel rose considerably as a result. With baby-boomers starting to retire, there is more recruiting and there is a noticeable rejuvenation of the staff.

Responsibility for the technical direction of research has shifted to the chemist as they carry out short-term projects in support of the business units.  [[PhD]]s who get [[MBA]]s are now more common.  Unlike the early years, all management has had business unit experience and many were hired into business units, coming into CRD later in their careers.  These managers are often far more administrative in their approach, not having the strong technical backgrounds required to keep up with their technical employees.  Some managers have come to rely upon their senior technical staff, but there is no clear guideline on the role that these senior scientists can or should play in managing the programs and careers of the younger scientists.

In late 2015, the name of the organization was changed to DuPont Science and Innovation portending the major layoff on January 4, 2016, which marked the end of the organization as a major force in research.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Jan. 25, 2016, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Combined, the Molecular Sciences and Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering portions of CR&amp;D went from 330 employees to 34 in the new Science and Innovation organization.

==Organofluorine chemistry==
[[Image:Fluorocarbon backbone.png|150px|thumb|A fluorocarbon chain is the backbone of Teflon and related chemicals]]

On April 6, 1938, Roy Plunkett at DuPont’s Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey was working with gases related to DuPont’s [[Freon]] [[refrigerants]] when he and his associates discovered that a sample of gaseous [[tetrafluoroethylene]] had polymerized spontaneously into a white, waxy solid.  The polymer was [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) commercialized by DuPont as [[Teflon]] in 1945.  Because DuPont was basic in a variety of fluorinated materials, it was logical that organofluorine chemistry became important to DuPont.  The discovery that tetrafluorethylene would cyclize with a wide variety of compounds to give fluorinated compounds opened up routes to a range of [[organofluorine compound]]s.

The hazards and difficulties of handling highly reactive and corrosive fluorinating reagents could be accommodated by DuPont’s emphasis on safety and DuPont’s association with the [[Manhattan Project]] provided many chemists and engineers with the background necessary to carry out the work.  Availability of the Pressure Research Lab on the [[DuPont Experimental Station|Experimental Station]] provided the necessary protection for most but not all of those reactions that went awry.  Notable scientists included William Middleton, David England, Carl Krespan, William Sheppard, [[Owen Webster]], Bruce Smart, Malli Rao, Robert Wheland, and Andrew Feiring, all of whom filed many patents for DuPont.  Sheppard wrote one of the important early books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Sheppard and Clay M. Sharts, ''Organic Fluorine Chemistry'', 1969, W. A. Benjamin, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smart's book followed.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Banks, B.E. Smart, and J.C. Tatlow, ''Organofluorine Chemistry: Principles and Commercial Applications'' (Topics in Applied Chemistry), Springer (New York); 1 edition (September 30, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Smart’s comments in [[Chemical Reviews]] in 1996, “Scientific and commercial interests in fluorine chemistry burgeoned after 1980, largely fueled by the need to replace industrial chlorofluorocarbons and the rapidly growing practical opportunities for organofluorine compounds in crop protection, medicine and diverse materials applications.  Although fluorine is much less abstruse now than when I entered the field a generation ago, it remains a specialized topic and most chemists are unfamiliar, or at least uncomfortable, with the synthesis and behavior of organofluorine compounds,” remain true today.

CRD undertook a program on alternatives for [[chlorofluorocarbons]] in [[refrigerant]]s in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to [[stratospheric]] [[ozone]] were published.  The Catalysis Center of CRD, under the leadership of Leo Manzer, was quick to respond with new technology to produce alternative [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] ([[HCFC]]s) that were commercialized as DuPont's [[Suva]] refrigerants.

==Cyanocarbon chemistry==
[[Image:Cyanocarbon backbone.png|150px|thumb|A cyanocarbon polymer]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, CRD developed a program under the direction of Theodore Cairns to synthesize long-chain cyanocarbons analogous to long-chain fluorocarbons like Teflon.  The work culminated in a series of twelve papers in the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] in 1958.  Several authors of those papers grew to prominent positions at DuPont including Richard E. Benson (Associate Director, CRD), Theodore L. Cairns (Research Director, CRD), Richard E. Heckert (CEO of DuPont), William D. Phillips (Associate Director, CRD),  Howard E. Simmons (Research Director and VP, CRD), and Susan A. Vladuchick (Plant Manager). This trend indicates the importance of technical qualification for promotion in the company at that time.  The publication stimulated other researchers to investigate these compounds.

[[Image:Diiminosuccinonitrile.svg|120px|thumb|Diiminosuccinonitrile (DISN)]]
[[Image:DAMN Structure.png|120px|thumb|[[Diaminomaleonitrile]] (DAMN)]]

Prospective applications included dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, organic magnets, and incorporation in new types of polymers.  No commercial applications resulted from this extensive research effort.  Partly for this work, Cairns was awarded medals for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry by the [[American Chemical Society]] and the Synthetic Organic Award of the [[Chemical Manufacturers Association]].  Another line of chemistry developed around [[Owen Webster]]'s synthesis of diiminosuccinonitrile (DISN), which could be converted to [[diaminomaleonitrile]] (DAMN), leading to another series of patent and papers.  Simmons used [[sodium maleonitriledithiolate]] for the preparation many novel substances of including tetracyanothiophene, tetracyanopyrrole, and pentacyanocyclopentadiene.

==Metal oxides==
Arthur Sleight led a team focused on [[perovskite]]s, such as the K-Bi-Pb-O system, that laid the groundwork for subsequent breakthroughs in high-temperature [[superconductors]].&lt;ref&gt;Sleight, A. W.; Gillson, J. L.; Bierstedt, P. E.  High-temperature superconductivity in the barium plumbate bismuthate (BaPb&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) systems.  Solid State Communications (1975), 17(1), 27-8.  Sleight, Arthur W.  Superconductive barium-lead-bismuth oxides. U.S. Patent 3932315 (1976).  Sleight, Arthur W.  Newer superconductors. CHEMTECH (1976), 6(7), 468-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  In solution phase chemistry of oxides, the work of Walter Knoth on organic soluble [[polyoxoanion]]s led to the development of the now large area with numerous applications in oxidation catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, W. H.; Domaille, P. J.; Harlow, R. L. "Heteropolyanions of the types M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(W&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt; and MM'M"(W&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;: novel coordination of nitrate and nitrite"  Inorganic Chemistry (1986), 25, 1577-84.

==Dynamic NMR spectroscopy==
Indicative of interplay between applications and fundamental science were many studies on stereodynamics conducted at CRD by Jesson, Meakin, and Muetterties.  One of the early studies focused on the [[fluxional molecule|non-rigidity]] of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a reagent relevant to the preparation of fluorocarbons.  Subsequent studies led to the discovery of the first stereochemically non-rigid octahedal complexes of the type FeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Meakin, P. Muetterties, E. L.; Jesson, J. P. "Stereochemically Nonrigid Six-Coordinate Molecules. III. The Temperature-Dependent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Some Iron and Ruthenium Dihydrides" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1973, 95, pp 75&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymer science==
[[Owen Webster]] discovered [[group-transfer polymerization]] (GTP), the first new polymerization process developed since living anionic polymerization.  The major aspects of the mechanism of the reaction were determined and the process was quickly converted to commercial application for automotive finishes and [[ink jet]] inks.  The basic process of group transfer also has application to general [[organic synthesis]], including [[natural products]].&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Webster and coworkers, ''Group-transfer polymerization. 1. A new concept for addition polymerization with silicon initiators''. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105(1983):5706-5708.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, Andrew Janowicz developed a useful version of cobalt catalyzed chain transfer for controlling the molecular weight of [[free radical]][[polymerization]]s.  The technology has been further developed by Alexei Gridnev and [[Steven Ittel]].  It, too, was quickly commercialized and a fundamental understanding of the process developed over a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Alexei I. Gridnev and [[Steven Ittel|Steven D. Ittel]], Chemical Reviews, 101, 3611-3659 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolph Pariser]] was the director of the Advanced Materials Science and Engineering at the time of these advances.

In 1995, [[Maurice Brookhart]], professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] and a DuPont CRD consultant, invented a new generation of [[post-metallocene catalyst]]s for olefin [[coordination polymerization]] based upon late transition metals with his postdoctoral student, Lynda Johnson who later joined CRD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Ittel|Steven D. Ittel]], Lynda K. Johnson and [[Maurice Brookhart]], ''Late-Metal Catalysts for Ethylene Homo- and Copolymerization'', Chemical Reviews, 100, 1169&amp;ndash;1203, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology, DuPont’s Versipol olefin polymerization technology, was developed by a substantial team of CRD scientists over the next ten years.

CRD developed a major interest in [[inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] chemistry.  Earl Muetterties established a program aimed at fundamental borane chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, W. H.; Miller, H. C.; England, D. C.; Parshall, G. W.; Muetterties, E. L.   Derivative chemistry of B10H10-- and B12H12--.    Journal of the American Chemical Society  (1962),  84  1056-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Knoth discovered the first polyhedral borane anion, B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, and also discovered that the borane anions displayed a substitution chemistry similar to that of aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, Walter H., Jr.  Ionic boron compounds.  U.S. Patent 3390966 (1968).  Knoth, Walter H., Jr.  Neutral and singly charged derivatives of decaboranes and decaborates.  U.S. Patent 3296260 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Miller discovered the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; anion in an effort to find a new route to B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Knoth, Walter H. Jr.; Miller, Norman Earl. Salts of polyhedral polyborates. U.S. Patent 3334136  (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Parshall]] joined CRD in 1954.  His industrial sabbatical at [[Imperial College London]] with [[Geoffrey Wilkinson]] in 1960-61 introduced him to [[organometallic chemistry]].  Muetterties left DuPont to join the faculty of [[Cornell]] in 1973.  After Muetterties and Parshall, the organometallic chemistry group was led by [[Steven Ittel]] and then Henry Bryndza before it was dispersed throughout a number of groups in CRD.  Parshall and Ittel coauthored a book on “Homogeneous Catalysis”&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Parshall and S. D. Ittel, ''Homogeneous Catalysis'', 2nd Edition, Wiley Interscience, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; that has become the standard reference on the subject.

The seminal contributions of Richard Cramer and [[Fred Tebbe]] are acknowledged by their named compounds, “Cramer’s dimer,” Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the “[[Tebbe reagent]].”  Tebbe had an influence on his lab partner, [[Richard Schrock]] who initiated a program on M=C chemistry at DuPont and continued it when he moved to [[MIT]].  The chemistry forms the basis for [[olefin metathesis]], and Schrock ultimately shared the [[Nobel Prize]] with [[Robert Grubbs]], a CRD consultant, for the metathesis work.  [[Anthony Joseph Arduengo III|Anthony Arduengo]]’s [[persistent carbene]]s opened up a new area of chemistry and they have proven to be important ligands in the metathesis process.

There was a vigorous effort on the activation of C-H bonds with contributions by Parshall, Thomas Herskovitz, Ittel, and David Thorn.  [[Chadwick Alma Tolman|Chad Tolman]] developed his “[[ligand cone angle]]” theory that developed into the widely accepted electronic and steric effects of [[ligand]]s on [[inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Tolman, ''Steric Effects of Phosphorus Ligands in Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis'', Chemical Reviews, 1977, volume 77, pages 313-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organometallic chemistry in CRD has further included R. Thomas Baker's heterobinuclear complexes, Patricia L. Watson's organolanthanides, William A. Nugent's metal-ligand multiple bonds,&lt;ref&gt;William A. Nugent and James M. Mayer, ''Metal-Ligand Multiple Bonds: The Chemistry of Transition Metal Complexes Containing Oxo, Nitrido, Imido, Alkylidene, or Alkylidyne Ligands'', Wiley-Interscience; 1 edition (October 31, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffery Thompson's and Mani Subramanyam's development of [[technetium]] complexes for radiopharmaceuticals, and Bob Burch's and Karin Karel's fluoro-organometallic chemistry.  The major outlet for organometallic chemistry is homogeneous catalysis.  DuPont developed a major technology based upon the nickel catalyzed addition of two molecules of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to [[butadiene]], giving [[adiponitrile]], a [[nylon]] intermediate, initially through the work of [[William C. Drinkard]].  The mechanistic work to provide an understanding of the technology was done in CRD and led to a large program on next-generation technology before the business was sold to Koch Industries.  Other applications of homogeneous catalysis studied in CRD include [[ethylene]] [[polymerization]], [[cyclohexane]] [[oxidation]] to [[adipic acid]], and [[butadiene]] [[carbonylation]] to [[nylon]] intermediates.  Approaches to catalyst systems have included homogeneous organometallic catalysts, heterobinuclear catalysts, [[polyoxometalate]]s, [[enzymes]], catalytic [[membrane reactor]]s and supported organometallics.

==Photochemistry and physics==
David M. McQueen, one of the early Directors of CRD was a physical chemist from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His research on [[photochemistry]] and [[photography]] resulted in thirty-five patents.  It was his background that got CRD started in photochemistry and photophysics.  David Eaton later headed a strong team involved in photopolymerization color proofing for the printing industry.

There was a strong program in inorganic non-linear optical materials that resulted in optical frequency doubling for the “green lasers” mentioned above.  This program was extended into organic materials with NLO properties.

There was also a strong effort on materials for the display industry and methods for preparing devices for displays.  These included printable electronics, thermal transfer methods for color filters, [[carbon nanotubes]] for field emission displays, and [[OLED]] materials and devices.  A substantial effort was made on next generation [[photoresist]]s for the [[semiconductor]] industry containing [[hydrocarbon]] and [[fluorocarbon]] [[monomers]] to replace wavelengths of 193&amp;nbsp;nm with 157&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths for better resolution.  Though most of the requirements were achieved, the need for that shorter wavelength node was eliminated by the introduction of [[immersion lithography]] and new fluids for [[immersion lithography]] continue to be of substantial interest.  Development of [[phase-shift mask]]s was commercialized.

==Biological sciences==
One area always deemed important for diversification of CRD's programs was related to the biological sciences.  Charles Stine had promoted biochemistry as a field of research for Du Pont and Stine Laboratories are named in his honor as a result.  In the early 1950s, CRD began a program to investigate chemicals for biological applications.  Charles Todd prepared substituted ureas as potential antibacterial agents, which when screened, proved to be effective herbicides.  These led to DuPont’s very successful and very selective sulfonylurea herbicides.  CRD's program included agricultural and veterinary chemicals and bacteriological and microbiological studies.  The culmination of this work was DuPont’s purchase of [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] [[Seeds]] and its integration into DuPont’s agrichemical enterprise.

In the mid- 1950s, CRD began work on the chemistry of [[nitrogen fixation]] in plants, a study that would develop into a major effort over the next decade.  In 1963, Ralph Hardy joined the CRD and brought Du Pont's nitrogen fixation research to international prominence with more than a hundred papers on the subject.  [[Chemical Week]] called him, "one of the nation's top achievers in the dual role of scientist and scientific manager," though such managers remained common in CRD through the 1960s and 70s.

[[Industrial fermentation|Fermentation]] [[microbiology]] and selective [[genetic modification]] became important to the CRD development of a biological route to 1,3-propylene glycol a new monomer for making polyester.  The availability of this new monomer led to the development and commercialization of Sorona, a premium [[polyester]].  Substantial success was also achieved in the synthesis of unnatural peptides and proteins to accomplish specific functions and prediction of their tertiary structures.

Advances in [[DNA sequencing]] technology based on synthesis of novel [[fluorescent]] labels led to Qualicon, a DuPont venture that identifies [[bacteria]] by examination of their [[DNA]] using [[PCR]]. This technology has led to significant improvements in the safety of the [[food supply]] chain in the United States and around the world.

'''Eduniversal''' is a university ranking business by the French [[Consultant|consulting]] company and [[rating agency]] ''SMBG'' specialized in [[Higher education|Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Presentation of the Eduniversal Company on a TV program, ''Télématin'' on a French Channel, France 2 - 26th of June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, one of the main goals of Eduniversal is to provide a tool, for students all around the world, which provides information on the Best [[Business school|Business Schools]], located in Eduniversal's 9 geographical regions (the 5 continents).

The Eduniversal ranking agency establishes an official selection of the Best 1000 Business Schools in more than 150 countries in the world. The purpose of this  selection is to offer students a serious [[referent]] that reflects the international dimension of each School, and therefore enables them to make the right decision regarding the choice of their future School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20080510110455694 FRANCE: Global list of business schools published]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official selection is the result of the work of an International Scientific Committee gathered at the initiative of the Eduniversal Company. The International Scientific Committee is composed of 12 members; 9 members coming from nine different geographic zones ([[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Middle East]], [[Far East Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Western Europe]]), and 2 members from the Eduniversal Company (The CEO and the International Coordinator).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trncinfo.com/TANITMADAIRESI/ARSIV2008/ENGLISHarcive/JANUARY/310108.htm, ''Gau and Emu selected amongst 1000 Business Schools of the world ''published on the 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The '''official selection'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, ''2009 : The World's Top 1000 Business Schools'', paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is defined by the Eduniversal Company is the classification of the 1000 best Business Schools in 153 countries in the World. The selection is classified in terms of '''Palms''' and '''Ratings''', issued from the Deans' votes.
The aim of this official selection is to provide sufficient information for [[student]]s about a range of [[academic institution]]s, sorted by their reputations and international ambitions and located in 9 different zones.

===Official Selection===

The Official Selection is a selection of Business Schools made by a Scientific Committee that has established a global mapping system meeting the criteria of universality and the international reputation of each academic institution.

Eduniversal offers to describe the best academic opportunities for students zone by zone, via a range of schools with different types of [[reputation]] and international ambitions, within the nine zones list.

According to the Eduniversal company, the international reputation is the capacity of a Business School to increase the prestige of a student – and therefore improve his [[employment]] prospects – in his country of study and on the international stage.

In order to execute the official selection, each country and each continent is represented according to a quota method. The number of schools per country is therefore weighted by quantitative and qualitative criteria.

'''Quantitative criteria'''
* the national [[expenditure]] on [[education]] per inhabitant
* the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]
* the size of the population
* the number of students in higher education

'''Qualitative criterion'''

the educational environment in the country (established, among other things, according to the number of [[secondary education]] academic institutions in the country, as well as a historical importance of the national educational tradition).
The results can therefore be expressed in the following way:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! '''Country''' !! '''National Expenditure on Education per inhabitant''' !! '''GDP per inhabitant''' !! '''Population size in Millions''' !! No. of students in Higher Education !! '''Qualitative Criterion''' !! '''Schools Quota Results'''
|-
| Tunisia || $605.10 || $8,898 || 9,815,644 || 26,435 || - || 4 Schools
|-
| Poland || $773.80 || $14,880 || 38,625,478 || 447,785 || - || 12 Schools
|-
| Indonesia || $64.80 || $4,323 || 245,452,739 || 552,660 || - || 7 Schools
|-
| Mexico || $495 || $11,249 || 107,449,525 || 339,450 || - || 17 Schools
|-
| Netherlands || $1,683.70 || $35,078 || 16,318,199 || 89,341 || - || 13 Schools
|}

The official selection is made by the International Scientific Committee composed of 9 members coming from the nine geographic zones listed above.

The 9 expert members are all well-known academics in their respective zone.

The International Scientific Committee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, International Selection Committee - last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; meets:
* to modify the Official Selection, two years after the first Selection, then every four years, depending on changes and global trends.
* yearly, to publish the Palmes arising from international criteria and the votes of the Deans on the website: www.eduniversal.net.

===Palmes===
The EDUNIVERSAL Palmes indicate the level of an academic institution's international reputation. They are awarded on the basis of the [[research]] work carried out by the International Scientific Committee, which compiles the list of criteria, together with the assessments made by peers: '''The Deans vote'''

They help the student to make his choice within the Official Selection and rate the reputation of the [[school]] or [[university]] within the country, its geographical zone, or even at the global level.

The Palmes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, Chapter : Identifying the Best Business Schools, ''Awarding the Palmes''&lt;/ref&gt; are divided into a league system, which allows horizontal intercontinental comparison, different from the vertical comparison made by most of the international classification systems.

This segmentation is presented as a normal probability curve:
* 100 schools in the 5 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 4 Palmes league
* 400 schools in the 3 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 2 Palmes league
* 100 schools in the 1 Palme league

The classification by Palmes is made using two essential elements: the '''internationalisation criteria''' and the '''Deans vote'''.

'''Internalisation criteria'''

* the [[accreditation]]s obtained by the schools ([[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]], [[European Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]], [[European Quality Improvement System|AMBA]], State Qualification, etc.)
* the main classifications ([[Financial Times]], [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], [[Business Week]], [[Asiaweek]], [[Wall Street Journal]], America savings, [[Times Higher Education|THES]], SMBG, etc.)
* participation in international academic associations ([[European Foundation for Management Development|EFMD]], CLADEA, [[Central and East European Management Development Association|CEEMAN]], [[Executive Master of Business Administration|EMBA]], [[Association of Asia-Pacific Business Schools|AAPBS]], etc.)
* the network of partners of Deans and Business Schools at the international and local levels
* reputed studies and sites in the world of education and universities

'''Deans vote''':&lt;ref&gt;http://vijaysrinivasan.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/iim-bangalore-ranked-among-27-best-b-schools-in-the-world-1-in-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Dean (education)|Dean]] from the universities and schools on the list of 1,000 can vote to recommend the other academic institutions. This vote is converted into a recommendation rate that the student can use to evaluate each academic institution and compare them.

These recommendations give another reply to the question: "Out of the following schools, which ones would you most recommend to a person who wants to study in this country?"

==Insolvency proceedings==
Eduniversal was placed into receivership on February 20, 2018. The announce of the receivership procedure was published in the ''BODACC'' ([[French (language)|French]]: ''Bulletin officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales'', the French official registry of civil and commercial notices) on March 1, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/eduniversal-92/entreprise-399207729&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.procedurecollective.fr/fr/redressement-judiciaire/1390184/eduniversal.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodacc.fr/annonce/detail-annonce/A/20180042/2406&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flow graph''' is a form of [[Digraph (mathematics)|digraph]] associated with a set of linear algebraic or differential equations:&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;
:"A signal flow graph is a network of nodes (or points) interconnected by directed branches, representing a set of linear algebraic equations. The nodes in a flow graph are used to represent the variables, or parameters, and the connecting branches represent the coefficients relating these variables to one another. The flow graph is associated with a number of simple rules which enable every possible solution [related to the equations] to be obtained."&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;

Although this definition uses the terms "signal flow graph" and "flow graph" interchangeably, the term "signal flow graph" is most often used to designate the [[Mason graph|Mason signal-flow graph]], Mason being the originator of this terminology in his work on electrical networks.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason2/&gt; Likewise, some authors use the term "flow graph" to refer strictly to the [[Coates graph|Coates flow graph]].&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoskins/&gt; According to Henley &amp; Williams:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;
:"The nomenclature is far from standardized, and...no standardization can be expected in the foreseeable future."

A designation "flow graph" that includes both the Mason graph and the Coates graph, and a variety of other forms of such graphs&lt;ref name=Murota/&gt; appears useful, and agrees with Abrahams and Coverley's and with Henley and Williams' approach.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

A '''directed network''' – also known as a [[flow network]] – is a particular type of flow graph. A ''network'' is a graph with real numbers associated with each of its edges, and if the graph is a digraph, the result is a ''directed network''.&lt;ref name=Chartrand/&gt; A flow graph is more general than a directed network, in that the edges may be associated with ''gains, branch gains'' or ''transmittances'', or even functions of the Laplace operator ''s'', in which case they are called ''transfer functions''.&lt;ref name=Henley2/&gt;

There is a close relationship between graphs and matrices and between digraphs and matrices.&lt;ref name=Harary/&gt; "The algebraic theory of matrices can be brought to bear on graph theory to obtain results elegantly", and conversely, graph-theoretic approaches based upon flow graphs are used for the solution of linear algebraic equations.&lt;ref name=Swamy/&gt;

== Deriving a flow graph from equations  ==
[[File:Signal flow graph example.png|thumb|200px|An example of a signal flow graph]]
[[File:Flow graph for three linear equations.png|300px|thumb|Flow graph for three simultaneous equations. The edges incident on each node are colored differently just for emphasis.]]
An example of a flow graph connected to some starting equations is presented.

The set of equations should be consistent and linearly independent. An example of such a set is:&lt;ref name="Henley2"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;0\\
0&amp;1&amp;1\\
5&amp;-1&amp;-1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}5\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Consistency and independence of the equations in the set is established because the determinant of coefficients is non-zero, so a solution can be found using [[Cramer's rule]].

Using the examples from the subsection [[Mason graph#Elements of signal flow graphs|Elements of signal flow graphs]], we construct the graph In the figure, a signal-flow graph in this case. To check that the graph does represent the equations given, go to node ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Look at the  arrows incoming to this node (colored green for emphasis) and the weights attached to them. The equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is satisfied by equating it to the sum of the nodes attached to the incoming arrows multiplied by the weights attached to these arrows. Likewise, the red arrows and their weights provide the equation for ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the blue arrows for ''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Another example is the general case of three simultaneous equations with unspecified coefficients:&lt;ref name=Deo/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}&amp;c_{12}&amp;c_{13}\\
c_{21}&amp;c_{22}&amp;c_{23}\\
c_{31}&amp;c_{32}&amp;c_{33}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\y_2\\y_3\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
To set up the flow graph, the equations are recast so each identifies a single variable by adding it to each side. For example:
:&lt;math&gt; \left( c_{11}+1 \right) x_1+c_{12}x_2+c_{13}x_3-y_1 = x_1 \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Using the diagram and summing the incident branches into ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''  this equation is seen to be satisfied.

As all three variables enter these recast equations in a symmetrical fashion, the symmetry is retained in the graph by placing each variable at the corner of an equilateral triangle. Rotating the figure 120° simply permutes the indices. This construction can be extended to more variables by placing the node for each variable at the vertex of a regular polygon with as many vertices as there are variables.

Of course, to be meaningful the coefficients are restricted to values such that the equations are independent and consistent.

The '''gene-for-gene relationship''' was discovered by the late [[Harold Henry Flor]]&lt;ref name=Flor1942&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flor H.H. | year = 1942 | title = Inheritance of pathogenicity in ''Melampsora lini'' | url = | journal = Phytopath | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 653–669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flor1947&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flor H.H. | year = 1947 | title = Inheritance of reaction to rust in flax | url = | journal = J.

Flor showed that the inheritance of both resistance in the host and parasite ability to cause disease is controlled by pairs of matching genes. One is a plant gene called the resistance (''R'') gene. The other is a parasite gene called the avirulence (''Avr'') gene. Plants producing a specific R gene product are resistant towards a pathogen that produces the corresponding ''Avr'' gene product.&lt;ref name=HostMgt&gt;[[Raoul A. Robinson|Robinson, Raoul A.]] (1987) Host Management in Crop Pathosystems, Macmillan Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene-for-gene relationships are a widespread and very important aspect of [[plant disease resistance]]. An example can be seen with ''[[Lactuca serriola]]''.

In doing so, he discovered the differential interaction that is common to all gene-for-gene relationships and that is now known as the Person differential interaction.&lt;ref name="HostMgt"/&gt;

==Resistance genes==

===Classes of resistance gene===

There are several different classes of R Genes. The major classes are the NBS-LRR genes&lt;ref name = "pmid16677430"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McHale L, Tan X, Koehl P, Michelmore RW | title = Plant NBS-LRR proteins: adaptable guards. | journal = Genome Biol | year = 2006 | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 212 | pmid = 16677430 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2006-7-4-212 | pmc = 1557992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cell surface [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRR).&lt;ref name="Song W-Y 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Song WY, Wang GL, Zhu LH, Fauquet C, Ronald P | year = 1995 | title = A receptor kinase-like protein encoded by the rice disease resistance gene Xa21 | url = | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5243| pages = 1804–1806 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5243.1804 | pmid=8525370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein products of the NBS-LRR R genes contain a [[nucleotide]] binding site (NBS) and a [[leucine rich repeat]] (LRR). The protein products of the PRRs contain extracellular, juxtamembrane, transmembrane and intracellular non-RD kinase domains.&lt;ref name="Song W-Y 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dardick C, Ronald P |title=Plant and animal pathogen recognition receptors signal through non-RD kinases |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e2 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16424920 |pmc=1331981 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the NBS-LRR class of R genes are two subclasses:&lt;ref name="pmid16677430"/&gt;

*One subclass has an amino-terminal Toll/Interleukin 1 receptor homology region (TIR). This includes the ''N'' resistance gene of [[tobacco]] against [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV).
*The other subclass does not contain a TIR and instead has a [[leucine zipper]] region at its amino terminal.

The [[protein]] products encoded by this class of resistance gene are located within the [[plant cell]] [[cytoplasm]].

The PRR class of R genes includes the rice XA21 resistance gene that recognizes the ax21 peptide &lt;ref name="Sang-Won Lee 2009. pp. 850-853"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sang-Won Lee |author2=Sang-Wook Han |author3=Malinee Sririyanum |author4=Chang-Jin Park |author5=Young-Su Seo |author6=Pamela C. Ronald |title= A Type I–Secreted, Sulfated Peptide Triggers XA21-Mediated Innate Immunity.|journal= Science |date=6 November 2009|volume=326|issue= 5954|pages= 850–853| DOI= 10.1126/science.1173438 |pmid=19892983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arabidopsis FLS2 peptide that recognizes the flg22 peptide from flagellin.

There are other classes of R genes, such as the extracellular LRR class of R genes; examples include [[rice]] Xa21D &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang GL, Ruan DL, Song WY, Sideris S, Chen L, Pi LY, Zhang S, Zhang Z, Fauquet C | year = 1998 | title = The rice disease resistance gene, Xa21D, encodes a receptor-like molecule with a LRR domain that determines race specific recognition and is subject to adaptive evolution | pmid=9596635 | journal = Plant Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 765–779 | pmc=144027 | doi=10.2307/3870663|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; for resistance against ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' and the ''cf'' genes of [[tomato]] that confer resistance against ''[[Cladosporium|Cladosporium fulvum]]''.

The ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' tomato resistance gene (Pto) belongs to a class of its own. It encodes a Ser/Thr kinase but has no LRR. It requires the presence of a linked NBS-LRR gene, ''prf'', for activity.

===Specificity of resistance genes===

R gene specificity (recognising certain Avr gene products) is believed to be conferred by the [[leucine]] rich repeats. LRRs are multiple, serial repeats of a motif of roughly 24 [[amino acid]]s in length, with leucines or other [[hydrophobic]] residues at regular intervals. Some may also contain regularly spaced [[proline]]s and [[arginine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang L, Meakin H, Dickinson M |title=Isolation of genes expressed during compatible interactions between leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and wheat using cDNA-AFLP |journal=Mol. Plant Pathol. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=469–77 |date=November 2003 |pmid=20569406 |doi=10.1046/j.1364-3703.2003.00192.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LRRs are involved in protein-protein interactions, and the greatest variation amongst resistance genes occurs in the LRR domain. LRR swapping experiments between resistance genes in [[flax rust]] resulted in the specificity of the resistance gene for the avirulence gene changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeYoung BJ, Innes RW |title=Plant NBS-LRR proteins in pathogen sensing and host defense |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=1243–9 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17110940 |pmc=1973153 |doi=10.1038/ni1410 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recessive resistance genes===

Most resistance genes are [[autosomal dominant]] but there are some, most notably the ''[[mlo]]'' gene in [[barley]], in which [[Monogenic (genetics)|monogenic]] resistance is conferred by [[recessive]] [[allele]]s. ''mlo'' protects barley against nearly all pathovars of ''powdery mildew''.

==Avirulence genes==

The term “avirulence gene” remains useful as a broad term that indicates a gene that encodes any determinant of the specificity of the interaction with the host. Thus, this term can encompass
some conserved microbial signatures (also called [[Pathogen-associated molecular pattern|pathogen or microbe associated molecular patterns]] (PAMPs or MAMPs)) and pathogen effectors (e.g. bacterial type III effectors and oomycete effectors) as well as any genes that control variation in the activity of those molecules.&lt;ref name="Sang-Won Lee 2009. pp. 850-853"/&gt;

There is no common structure between avirulence gene products. Because there would be no evolutionary advantage to a pathogen keeping a protein that only serves to have it recognised by the plant, it is believed that the products of Avr genes play an important role in [[virulence]] in genetically susceptible hosts.

''Example:'' AvrPto is a small triple-helix protein that, like several other effectors, is targeted to the plasma membrane by N-myristoylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wulf J, Pascuzzi PE, Fahmy A, Martin GB, Nicholson LK | year = 2004 | title = The solution structure of type III effector protein AvrPto reveals conformational and dynamic featuresimportant for plant pathogenesis | url = | journal = Structure | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 1257–1268 | doi=10.1016/j.str.2004.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AvrPto is an inhibitor of PRR kinase domains. PRRs signal plants to induce immunity when PAMPs are detected.&lt;ref&gt;Xin, X.F. and S.H. He. 2013. Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000: a model pathogen for probing disease susceptibility and hormone signaling in pants. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 51:473-498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiang, T. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiang T, Zong N, Zou Y, Wu Y, Zhang J, Xing W, Li Y, Tang X, Zhu L ''et al'' | year = 2008 | title = Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPto blocks innate immunity by targeting receptor kinases | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 74–80 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.12.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to target receptor kinases is required for the virulence function of AvrPto in plants. However, Pto is a resistant gene that can detect AvrPto and induce immunity as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deslandes L, Rivas S | year = 2012 | title = Catch me if you can: bacterial effectors and plant targets | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2012.06.011 | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 644–655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  AvrPto is an ancient effector that is conserved in many P. syringae strains, whereas Pto R gene is only found in a few wild tomato species.&lt;ref name="Xiang, T. 2008"/&gt;  This suggests recent evolution of the Pto R gene and the pressure to evolve to target AvrPto, turning a virulence effector to an avirulence effector.

Unlike the MAMP or PAMP class of avr genes that are recognized by the host PRRs, the targets of bacterial effector avr proteins appear to be proteins involved in plant [[Innate immunity#Host defense in plants|innate immunity]] signaling, as [[homology (biology)|homologues]] of Avr genes in animal pathogens have been shown to do this. For example, the AvrBs3 family of proteins possess [[DNA]] binding domains, [[nuclear localisation signal]]s and acidic activation domains and are believed to function by altering host cell transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahaye T, Bonas U |title=Molecular secrets of bacterial type III effector proteins |journal=Trends Plant Sci. |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=479–85 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11590067 |doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(01)02083-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The guard hypothesis==

In only some cases is there direct interaction between the R gene product and the Avr gene product. For example, both FLS2 and XA21 interact with the microbial peptides. In contrast, for the NBS-LRR class of R genes, direct interaction has not been shown for most of the R/avr pairs.  This lack of evidence for a direct interaction led to the formation of the guard [[hypothesis]] for the NBS-LRR class of R genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01311-5 | title = Plant disease-resistance proteins and the gene-for-gene concept | first2 = J.

This [[Scientific modeling|model]] proposes that the R proteins interact, or guard, a protein known as the guardee which is the target of the Avr protein. When it detects interference with the guardee protein, it activates resistance.

Several experiments support this hypothesis, e.g. the Rpm1 gene in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is able to respond to two completely unrelated avirulence factors from ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]''. The guardee protein is RIN4, which is hyperphosphorylated by the Avr proteins. Another high profile study that supports the guard hypothesis shows that the RPS5 pair uses PBS1, a protein kinase as a guardee against AvrPphB.&lt;ref name="Shao et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. Shao, Golstein, Ade, Stoutemyer, Dixon, and Innes|title=Cleavage of ''Arabidopsis'' PBS1 by a bacterial type III effector |journal=Science |date=2003-08-29 |pages=1230–3 |pmid=12947197 |doi=10.1126/science.1085671|volume=301 |issue=5637}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2010 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Two-hybrid screening|Yeast two-hybrid studies]] of the tomato Pto/Prf/AvrPto interaction showed that the Avirulence protein, AvrPto, interacted directly with Pto despite Pto not having an LRR. This makes Pto the guardee protein, which is protected by the NBS-LRR protein Prf. However, Pto is a resistance gene alone, which is an argument against the guard hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grzeskowiak|first=L|last2=Stephan|first2=W|last3=Rose|first3=LE|date=2014-10-01|others=|title=Epistatic selection and coadaptation in the Prf resistance complex of wild tomato|url=https://openpub.fmach.it/retrieve/handle/10449/23790/10557/Coadaptation2014.pdf|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|volume=27|pages=456–471|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2014.06.019|lay-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

==Discovery==
[[Image:Pigen, der finder guldhornet (1906) harald slott-møller.jpg|thumb|''The Girl Who Finds The Gold Horn'' (1906) by [[Harald Slott-Møller]].]]
[[File:Gallehus Journal des Savants 1678.png|thumb|A description of the first horn was published in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]'' in 1678.]]
[[File:Paulli 1734 title page illustration.png|thumb|Title page illustration of the 1734 treatise on the second horn by Richard Joachim Paulli]]
[[File:Guldhorn paulli.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Depiction of the horn found AD 1734 on 21 April near the village of Gallehus, in Schackenborg county, not far from the town of Tønder as a peasant was digging, at nearly the same place as a similar one was found AD 1639. It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya''' ([[Arabic]]: هجر امذيبية) is an ancient settlement that date back to the kingdom of Hadramawt in [[Nisab District|Nisab]] district of [[Shabwah Governorate]] in [[Yemen]]. The site [[necropolis]] (100 m large) revealed elaborate and extraordinary burial objects. Though the findings was concentrated in a small portion of the general area. Four burials only were excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
[[File:Shabwa2.jpg||thumb|250px| Silver ladle found in one of the burials]]
The city sequence is divided into 5 phases based on major changes of the site architecture. The initial phase on the hill top is usually dated to first centuries AD and was dominated by a single building constructed using characteristic technique of pre-Islamic south Arabia. Only one room in the structure with preserved floor exist. It appears, from the fill beneath the plaster floor, that at one point, the building was renewed. Glacis (4–6 m wide) was also constructed on the site, however whether it encircle the entire tell is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Two seasons at Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya, Yemen, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (AEE):  P.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the surface layers of the necropolis, the tombs appear to span over several centuries. Grave 3 is dated approximately between 1st to 4th century AD. And the artifacts found there shows detectable Roman artistic influence.

Four burials had been excavated in the site necropolis, only grave 3 was intact, and it yielded great amount of funerary possessions. Which apparently belonged to either an upper class individual, or rather a soldier as suggested by the presence of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hall circles''' (also known as M-circles and N-circles) are a graphical tool in [[control theory]] used to obtain values of a [[closed-loop transfer function]] from the [[Nyquist-plot|Nyquist plot]] (or the [[Nichols plot]]) of the associated open-loop transfer function. Hall circles have been introduced in control theory by Albert C. Hall in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857968901|title=The analysis and synthesis of linear servomechanisms|last=C.|first=Hall, Albert|date=1943|publisher=Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=9780262080736|location=Cambridge|oclc=857968901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Consider a closed-loop linear control system with open-loop transfer function given by [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; and with a unit gain in the feedback loop. The closed-loop transfer function is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt; T(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)} &lt;/math&gt;. 

To check the stability of ''T''(''s''), it is possible to use the Nyquist stability criterion with the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function ''G''(''s''). Note, however, that only the Nyquist plot of ''G''(''s'') does not give the actual values of ''T''(''s''). To get this information from the G(s)-plane, Hall proposed to construct the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant magnitude and the also the locus of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant phase angle.

Given a positive real value ''M'' representing a fixed magnitude, and denoting G(s) by ''z'', the points satisfying  &lt;math display="block"&gt; M = |T(s)| = \frac{|G(s)|}{|1+G(s)|} = \frac{|z|}{|1+z|} &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points ''z'' in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the ratio of the distance between ''z'' and 0 and the distance between ''z'' and -1 is equal to ''M''. The points ''z'' satisfying this locus condition are [[circles of Apollonius]], and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''M-circles''.

Given a positive real value ''N'' representing a phase angle, the points satisfying &lt;math display="block"&gt; N = \arg \left[\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}\right] = \arg[G(s)] - \arg[1+G(s)] = \arg[z] - \arg[1+z] &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points z in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the angle between -1 and z and the angle between 0 and z is constant. In other words, the angle opposed to the line segment between -1 and 0 must be constant. This implies that the points z satisfying this locus condition are arcs of circles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/inscribed.shtml|title=Munching on Inscribed Angles|last=|first=|date=|website=cut-the-knot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''N-circles''.

== Usage ==
[[File:Nichols_chart.svg|thumb|Nichols plot of the transfer function 1/s(1+s)(1+2s) along with the modified M and N circles.]]
To use the Hall circles, a plot of M and N circles is done over the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function. The points of the intersection between these graphics give the corresponding value of the closed-loop transfer function.

Hall circles are also used with the [[Nichols plot]] and in this setting, are also known as Nichols chart. Rather than overlaying directly the Hall circles over the Nichols plot, the points of the circles are transferred to a new coordinate system where the ordinate is given by &lt;math&gt; 20 \log_{10}(|G(s)|) &lt;/math&gt; and the abscissa is given by &lt;math&gt; \arg(G(s))&lt;/math&gt;. The advantage of using Nichols chart is that adjusting the gain of the open loop transfer function directly reflects in up and down translation of the Nichols plot in the chart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">The '''''Heidelberg Appeal''''', authored by [[Michel Salomon]], was an appeal directed against the findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;James Lawrence Powell: ''The Inquisition of Climate Science''. New York 2012, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; organised initially by the tobacco industry as part of its "junk-science" program. The Heidelberg Appeal's goal was similar to the later published [[Leipzig Declaration]] and an earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Allison |last2=Robinson |first2=John |date=2004 |title=RELEVANT BUT NOT PRESCRIPTIVE?

It was published at the last day of the [[Rio Summit]] 1992 and warned governments that they don't base their policy on environmental policy, which they regarded as "pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data."&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt; It was brought forward by the tobacco and asbestos industry, to support the climate-denying [[Global Climate Coalition]]. According to [[SourceWatch]] the appeal is "a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition". Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their "sound science" agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;

==Signed up for what?==

The technique used by Salomon's group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. It is important to realise that, at this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology.  They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.

The document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the 'go-to authorities' on all such health and environmental matters.  They didn't see this as a climate-denial statement.

One of the signatories, Nobel Prize winner [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], a professor of physics at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists.  He complained that despite science's disapproval, CFC's persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It's a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet's ecological degradation."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as &lt;blockquote&gt;''"clearly irrational?" [... ] "This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends." [such] forces "make the public afraid of science."'' 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-scientist.com/news/rio-document-spurs-debate-is-science-an-ecological-foe-60005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general 'motherhood' statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products.  However, when release and publicised by [[Fred Singer]]'s [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release.  It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.

==Success?==

The ''Heidelberg Appeal'' has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of [[global warming]] as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the [[Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation]], which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]], a group set up by Michael Salomon "that was considered important in [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]' plans to create a group in Europe similar to [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1446867 | pmid=11684592 | volume=91 | title=Junking science to promote tobacco | date=November 2001 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1745–8 | last1 = Yach | first1 = D | last2 = Bialous | first2 = SA | doi=10.2105/ajph.91.11.1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html International Center for A Scientific Ecology Guidelines for the Seminar on Linear Relationship for Risk Assessment of Low Doses of Carcinogens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014201129/http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html |date=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Originator ==

Michel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based "Projections" magazine. He was hired by Philip Morris to extend their junk-science program into Europe. They had already been highly successful with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt; TASSC ([[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]]) in the US under [[Steven Milloy]], &lt;br&gt; &lt;LI&gt; SEPP ([[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (run by Fred Singer) and semi-attached to TASSC.
&lt;LI&gt; ESEF ([[European Science and Environment Forum]]) run by [[Roger Bate]] on secondment from the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] in London.&lt;/ul&gt;

Following the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka "CIES") which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]] or, in French, the [[Centre International pour une Ecologie Scientifique]].  He wrote about the appeal:
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; ''... we brought together at Heidelberg about fifty well-known scientists, including Nobel Prize winners Rita Levi and Manfred Eigen, as well as medical practitioners, sociologists, moralists and members of the editorial staff of Projections. They came from a range of disciplines, from numerous European countries, including the former Soviet Union, and had divergent views on many questions. 

Why Heidelberg? We wanted to meet in a prestigious European university town. Oxford or Cambridge would have done just as well. The warm welcome we received at the beginning of our round of the university towns, from cardiologist Gothard Schettler, Vice President of the Academy of Science at Heidelberg, and from Professor Harald zur Hausen at the Cancer Research Institute, persuaded us to pitch our tent on the banks of the Neckar. As the substances in question were incriminated, among other things, for their supposed or real carcinogenic effects, we accepted Professor zur Hausen's generous hospitality.  

 The Heidelberg meeting was lively and fruitful. Experts in CFCs, dioxins, radiation and asbestos summarized the latest epidemiological and other research on the impact of these substances on health, and their conclusions were discussed by the members of the meeting. But the question of the coming ''' Earth Summit''' preoccupied the participants too much for them to stop at purely technical discussions. ''' We were therefore not overly surprised when numerous voices were raised wanting the group to discuss Rio and to adopt a definite position on the matter.'''

 &lt;u&gt;We had rather anticipated this reaction&lt;/u&gt;. An initial text which we had passed round friends in Paris had already attracted about fifty signatures. We presented it at Heidelberg. It was discussed paragraph by paragraph, word by word. The Heidelberg declaration in its present version was the result of those discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20779">In [[machine learning]], '''hyperparameter optimization''' or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyperparameters]] for a learning algorithm.

The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined [[loss function]] on given independent data.&lt;ref name=abs1502.02127&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1502.02127|last1=Claesen|first1=Marc|title=Hyperparameter Search in Machine Learning|author2=Bart De Moor|class=cs.LG|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss.&lt;ref name=abs1502.02127/&gt; [[Cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]] is often used to estimate this generalization performance.&lt;ref name="bergstra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergstra|first1=James|last2=Bengio|first2=Yoshua|year=2012|title=Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization|url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf|journal=J. Machine Learning Research|volume=13|pages=281–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Grid search ===
The traditional way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been ''grid search'', or a ''parameter sweep'', which is simply an [[Brute-force search|exhaustive searching]] through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. A grid search algorithm must be guided by some performance metric, typically measured by [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] on the training set&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Wei Hsu, Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin (2010). [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf A practical guide to support vector classification]. Technical Report, [[National Taiwan University]].&lt;/ref&gt;
or evaluation on a held-out validation set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pmc= 5721660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the parameter space of a machine learner may include real-valued or unbounded value spaces for certain parameters, manually set bounds and discretization may be necessary before applying grid search.

For example, a typical soft-margin [[support vector machine|SVM]] [[statistical classification|classifier]] equipped with an [[radial basis function kernel|RBF kernel]] has at least two hyperparameters that need to be tuned for good performance on unseen data: a regularization constant ''C'' and a kernel hyperparameter γ. Both parameters are continuous, so to perform grid search, one selects a finite set of "reasonable" values for each, say

:&lt;math&gt;C \in \{10, 100, 1000\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \{0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0\}&lt;/math&gt;

Grid search then trains an SVM with each pair (''C'', γ) in the [[Cartesian product]] of these two sets and evaluates their performance on a held-out validation set (or by internal cross-validation on the training set, in which case multiple SVMs are trained per pair). Finally, the grid search algorithm outputs the settings that achieved the highest score in the validation procedure.

Grid search suffers from the [[curse of dimensionality]], but is often [[embarrassingly parallel]] because typically the hyperparameter settings it evaluates are independent of each other.&lt;ref name="bergstra"/&gt;

=== Random search ===
{{main|Random search}}

Random Search replaces the exhaustive enumeration of all combinations by selecting them randomly. This can be simply applied to the discrete setting described above, but also generalizes to continuous and mixed spaces. It can outperform Grid search, especially when only a small number of hyperparameters affects the final performance of the machine learning algorithm.&lt;ref name="bergstra" /&gt; In this case, the optimization problem is said to have a low intrinsic dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziyu|first=Wang|last2=Frank|first2=Hutter|last3=Masrour|first3=Zoghi|last4=David|first4=Matheson|last5=Nando|first5=de Feitas|date=2016|title=Bayesian Optimization in a Billion Dimensions via Random Embeddings|url=http://jair.org/papers/paper4806.html|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|language=en|volume=55|pages=361–387|doi=10.1613/jair.4806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Random Search is also [[embarrassingly parallel]], and additionally allows to include prior knowledge by specifying the distribution from which to sample.

=== Bayesian optimization ===
{{main|Bayesian optimization}}

Bayesian optimization is a global optimization method for noisy black-box functions.  Applied to hyperparameter optimization, Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameter values to the objective evaluated on a validation set. By iteratively evaluating a promising hyperparameter configuration based on the current model, and then updating it, Bayesian optimization, aims to gather observations revealing as much information as possible about this function and, in particular, the location of the optimum. It tries to balance exploration (hyperparameters for which the outcome is most uncertain) and exploitation (hyperparameters expected close to the optimum). In practice, Bayesian optimization has been shown&lt;ref name="hutter"&gt;{{Citation

=== Gradient-based optimization ===
For specific learning algorithms, it is possible to compute the gradient with respect to hyperparameters and then optimize the hyperparameters using gradient descent. The first usage of these techniques was focused on neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larsen|first1=Jan|last2= Hansen |first2=Lars Kai|last3=Svarer|first3=Claus|last4=Ohlsson|first4=M|title=Design and regularization of neural networks: the optimal use of a validation set|journal=Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, these methods have been extended to other models such as [[support vector machine]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Olivier Chapelle |author2=Vladimir Vapnik |author3=Olivier Bousquet |author4=Sayan Mukherjee |title=Choosing multiple parameters for support vector machines |journal=Machine Learning |year=2002 |volume=46 |pages=131–159 |url=http://www.chapelle.cc/olivier/pub/mlj02.pdf | doi = 10.1023/a:1012450327387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or logistic regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =Chuong B|author2= Chuan-Sheng Foo|author3=Andrew Y Ng|journal = Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 20|title = Efficient multiple hyperparameter learning for log-linear models|year =2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach in order to obtain a gradient with respect to hyperparameters consists in differentiating the steps of an iterative optimization algorithm using  [[automatic differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domke|first1=Justin|title=Generic Methods for Optimization-Based Modeling|journal=Aistats|date=2012|volume=22|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v22/domke12/domke12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abs1502.03492&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Maclaurin|first1=Douglas|last2=Duvenaud|first2=David|last3=Adams|first3=Ryan P.|eprint=1502.03492|title=Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible Learning|class=stat.ML|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary optimization ===
{{main|Evolutionary algorithm}}

Evolutionary optimization is a methodology for the global optimization of noisy black-box functions. In hyperparameter optimization, evolutionary optimization uses [[evolutionary algorithms]] to search the space of hyperparameters for a given algorithm.&lt;ref name="bergstra11" /&gt; Evolutionary hyperparameter optimization follows a [[Evolutionary algorithm#Implementation|process]] inspired by the biological concept of [[evolution]]:

# Create an initial population of random solutions (i.e., randomly generate tuples of hyperparameters, typically 100+)
# Evaluate the hyperparameters tuples and acquire their [[fitness function]] (e.g., 10-fold [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] accuracy of the machine learning algorithm with those hyperparameters)
# Rank the hyperparameter tuples by their relative fitness
# Replace the worst-performing hyperparameter tuples with new hyperparameter tuples generated through [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]
# Repeat steps 2-4 until satisfactory algorithm performance is reached or algorithm performance is no longer improving

In an interview with [[BBC News|BBC]], Manzoni explained how employees also contribute to their own unsatisfactory relationships with their superiors. Manzoni cautioned that attaching labels like demanding or overbearing can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "The moment you label someone as difficult you’ve just made them more difficult to work with because you’re not going to give this person the benefit of the doubt anymore and you’re not going to relate with them on a productive level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170817-how-to-identify-and-handle-a-demanding-boss|title=How to identify, and handle, a demanding boss|last=Johanson|first=Mark|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Star formation}}
The '''Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] process that occurs when the surface of a [[star]] or a [[planet]] cools. The cooling causes the pressure to drop, and the star or planet shrinks as a result. This compression, in turn, heats the core of the star/planet. This mechanism is evident on [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] and on [[brown dwarf]]s whose central temperatures are not high enough to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. It is estimated that Jupiter radiates more energy through this mechanism than it receives from the Sun, but Saturn might not. The latter process causes Jupiter to shrink at a rate of two centimetres each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Giant Planets of Our Solar System: Atmospheres, Composition, and Structure | author = Patrick G. J. Irwin | publisher = Springer | date = 2003 | isbn = 3-540-00681-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p8wCsJweUb0C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22kelvin+helmholtz+mechanism%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism was originally proposed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] in the late nineteenth century to explain the source of energy of the [[Sun]]. By the mid-nineteenth century, [[conservation of energy]] had been accepted, and one consequence of this law of physics is that the Sun must have some energy source to continue to shine.  Because nuclear reactions were unknown, the main candidate for the source of solar energy was gravitational contraction.

However, it  soon was recognized by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] and others that the total amount of energy available through this mechanism only allowed the Sun to shine for millions of years rather than the billions of years that the geological and biological evidence suggested for the [[age of the Earth]]. (Kelvin himself had argued that the Earth was millions, not billions, of years old.) The true source of the Sun's energy remained uncertain until the 1930s, when it was shown by [[Hans Bethe]] to be [[nuclear fusion]].

== Power generated by a Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = BW Carroll &amp; DA Ostlie| title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics (2nd Ed.)| pages = 296–298| publisher = Pearson Addison Wesley| date = 2007| ISBN = 0-8053-0402-9| url = http://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysics| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105230/http://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysics/| archivedate = 2015-12-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
It was theorised that the [[potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] from the contraction of the Sun could be its source of power. To calculate the total amount of energy that would be released by the Sun in such a mechanism (assuming uniform [[density]]), it was approximated to a perfect sphere made up of [[concentric]] shells. The gravitational potential energy could then be found as the integral over all the shells from the centre to its outer radius.

Gravitational potential energy from [[Newtonian mechanics]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and the two masses in this case are that of the thin shells of width ''dr'', and the contained mass within radius ''r'' as one integrates between zero and the radius of the total sphere. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G\int_0^R \frac{m(r) 4 \pi r^2 \rho}{r}\, dr,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the outer radius of the sphere, and ''m''(''r'') is the mass contained within the radius ''r''. Changing ''m''(''r'') into a product of volume and density to satisfy the integral,

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G\int_0^R \frac{4 \pi r^3 \rho 4 \pi r^2 \rho}{3r}\, dr = -\frac{16}{15}G \pi^2 \rho^2 R^5.&lt;/math&gt;

Recasting in terms of the mass of the sphere gives the total gravitational potential energy as

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}.&lt;/math&gt;

While uniform density is not correct, one can get a rough order of magnitude estimate of the expected age of our star by inserting known values for the [[Solar mass|mass]] and [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]], and then dividing by the known [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]] (note that this will involve another approximation, as the power output of the Sun has not always been constant):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_\text{r}}{L_\odot} \approx \frac{1.1 \times 10^{41}~\text{J}}{3.9 \times 10^{26}~\text{W}} \approx 8\,900\,000~\text{years},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the luminosity of the Sun. While giving enough power for considerably longer than many other physical methods, such as [[chemical energy]], this value was clearly still not long enough due to geological and biological evidence that the Earth was billions of years old. It was eventually discovered that [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] energy was responsible for the power output and long lifetimes of stars.&lt;ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kyushu University'''|九州大学|Kyūshū Daigaku}}, abbreviated to {{nihongo|''Kyudai''|九大|Kyūdai}}, is a Japanese national university located in [[Fukuoka]], in the island of [[Kyushu]]. It is the 4th oldest university in Japan and one of the former [[Imperial Universities]]. It is considered one of the most prestigious research-oriented universities in Japan. The history of Kyushu University can be traced back to the medical schools of the feudal domains established in 1867.

There are 2,089 foreign students ({{as of |2016}}) enrolled in the University. It was chosen for the Global 30 university program, and has been selected to the top 13 global university project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selection for the FY 2014 Top Global University Project |publisher=MEXT|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/houdou/26/09/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2014/10/07/1352218_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbol ==
Kyushu University does not have an official school song, instead it has one cheering song and three student songs including ''Matssubara-ni'', with lyrics by Yoshifumi Akiyama.

The University's logo features a background of pine needles inset with an older iterance of the kanji for "university". The logo was officially established in 2004, but was originally proposed by a student, Sou Yoshihide, in the mid-20th century, and was used then on from 1950. There have also been alternatives designs, such as those featuring the Japanese ''KU'' or ''Q'', for Kyushu instead of "university".

On March 3, prior to the incorporation of national universities in April 2004, the Committee of Public Relations agreed on a new university logo and color that symbolize Kyushu University under the new structure.

=== University logos ===
The pine needle design, which is used in the current university logo, remains in the new logo. On deciding the new logo, consideration was given as to whether it would still be highly distinctive even when electronically rendered. The introduction of the new logo, however, does not limit or eliminate the use of the previous one Fig. B.

Several patterns of university logos (Figs. C-F) have been created for use on PR materials and merchandise. Fig. C uses the same design as Fig. A without the two Chinese characters that mean “university,” while Fig. D illustrates a design using the capital letters of Kyushu University (KU). Fig. E symbolizes the letter “q” for “Q-shu” University. Fig. F is the logo originally printed on the university diploma. These logos are also registered and used as trademarks of Kyushu University.

=== Logo color ===
Dark red colors have been used for the logo of Kyushu University. The committee chose wine red as the new university logo color given that it is similar to the previous one and does not spoil the established image of Kyushu University’s logo color. Since the visual effects of color can vary according to usage, a variation of the wine color within an allowable range can be used as the logo color. To allow broader variations, the use of sub-colors was also approved.

== Global 30 Project&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/intlweb/data/pdf/gaiyou.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ==
On July 3, 2009, Kyushu University was chosen as one of thirteen venues for the “Global 30 (G30) Project”, planned and funded by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). The major aim of the project is to further promote the globalization of Japanese higher education by assisting a select number of universities through the prioritized allocation of grants. The recipient schools are expected, among other things, to build and improve a system whereby overseas students may study and engage in research with minimal cultural and linguistic barriers. This more focused approach to budget allocation is also expected to help realize the government’s public commitment to accommodate more than 300,000 international students on Japanese campuses by 2020.

In February 2010, the University opened an all-purpose office in Cairo, Egypt, bringing the number of its overseas offices to 13 . Although the Cairo Office is managed by Kyushu University, all other Japanese colleges and universities can have access to its services and facilities when trying to recruit students or promote academic projects in Egypt.

By implementing these measures, Kyushu University is expecting to raise the number of its international students to 3,900 within a decade, a 300% increase over the current number. By the time the five-year grant terminates, the University will also have laid the foundation for a new interdisciplinary department (tentatively called the “International School of Arts and Sciences”), which is expected to launch by 2020.

=== Liberal arts subjects and basic sciences ===
For the first year and a half, students in the international undergraduate programs study various liberal arts subjects and basic sciences. This segment of the programs aims not only to equip students with in-depth liberal arts knowledge and to help them deepen their understanding of various disciplines, but also to broaden their range of interests, and to enable them to continue learning independently.

(ASEAN University Network/ Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network) The AUN/SEED-Net was established in 2003 to full the following; to strengthen the main ASEAN universities education and research abilities, to strengthen the network between the universities of all the countries involved, including Japan, as well as, continuing to produce scientists needed in the economic and social areas of ASEAN nations. By accepting International Students and dispatching teachers, Kyushu University endeavors to train teachers of universities in ASEAN nations.

=== BOP by ICT ===
Income generation project for farmers at the BOP by ICT Kyushu University uses the funding from JICA to support Bangladeshi farming villages by creating business centers where ICT is used to provide farmers with the necessary information for farming. These centers are available anytime the farmer would like to visit. They are information hubs, where useful information regarding farmers produce and sales are being distributed by the use of ICT, amongst farmers in the hope that this will improve their income and reduce poverty.

== Graduate schools and faculties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
Kyushu University has instituted a Graduate School/Graduate Faculty system - the first attempt of this kind at a Japanese university - as part of the overall reorganization of undergraduate and graduate education at the university in 2000. In separating the former Graduate School into the Graduate School (the education body) and the Graduate Faculty (the research body to which faculty members belong), the University is seeking to revitalize relationships between the Graduate Faculty and the Graduate School, and the Graduate Faculty and Undergraduate School. These changes should promote a more dynamic functioning of the Graduate Faculty in its relation to the Graduate School and the Undergraduate School. (Refer to chart  below.)

Under the Graduate School/Faculty system, all faculty members have been transferred from members of the Undergraduate Faculty to members of the Graduate Faculty. In addition, the educational body (Graduate School) and research body (Graduate Faculty) have become independent administrative entities. This new, more responsive administrative mechanism will enable Graduate Faculty members to participate more flexibly in the education of both the Undergraduate and Graduate School bodies. In implementing a more dynamic configuration of the education bodies (Undergraduate and Graduate Schools) and research body (Graduate Faculty), the university can more readily accommodate changes and shifts to pedagogic and research foci that may occur in the future.

=== History ===
Kyushu University is one of the seven former Imperial Universities created in the [[Meiji period]]. The university is the largest research university in the Kyushu region with research centers in eleven different academic faculties, including the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and science.

Kyushu University Hospital is affiliated with the Faculty of Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Dental Science.

'''1867''' The [[Kuroda Clan]] establishes an institution for Western medicine (Sanseikan) for the children of the lord and their retainers. The roots of present-day Kyushu University Hospital can be traced back to the clinic affiliated with that school.

'''1879''' In the beginning of the Meiji period the clinic becomes an affiliated hospital of Fukuoka Prefectural Medical School.

'''1903''' Fukuoka Medical College, a branch school of Kyoto Imperial University is established, and the hospital becomes affiliated with that school.

'''1911''' Kyushu Imperial University is established in Fukuoka, and this hospital becomes affiliated with the university's Faculty of Medicine.

'''1931''' The Research Institute of Balneotherapeutics is established in [[Beppu]], [[Ōita Prefecture]].

'''1947''' Following the university reform that took place after World War II, the hospital’s name was changed to the Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences Affiliated Hospital. Fifteen departments, including a dental department, were established.

'''1967''' The Faculty of Dental Science becomes an independent facility. The Faculty of Dental Science Affiliated Hospital opens.

'''2003''' The three hospitals affiliated with Faculty of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Science and Medical Institute of Bioregulation merge to form Kyushu University Hospital.

'''2009''' Plans for the construction of a new hospital, which began in 2000, are completed. The new hospital consists of a South Ward, North Ward, West Ward and Outpatient Ward.

Its mission was to make Japan a world leader in science and technology: bringing a brighter future for Japan as well as making significant contributions to the international community.

In 2002, influenced by the government’s “Second-stage Basic Plan (Master Plan) for Science and Technology” (2001-2006) and by the strategies set_up by the Council for Science and Technology Policy (CSTP), ERATO received a complete makeover, under the bigger umbrella of “Strategic Basic Research Programs” initiated by the government.

The goal of Strategic Basic Research Programs is to promote problem-solving oriented basic research, guided by strategies set by the government based on social and economic needs as well as the national policy on science and technology.

Director: Prof. [[Chihaya Adachi]]

The new research building for the Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics Research (OPERA) was completed at the ITO campus in August 2011 and several OPERA research laboratories have been constructed inside. The building has three doors and is 2400 square meters in area, and has a clean room, physical equipment room, synthetic laboratory rooms, conference rooms and a cafe.

=== JST ERATO Takahara Soft Interfaces Project ===

The 19th century was the era of hard materials such as steel, some of which were replaced by polymers in the 20th century. The 21st century will be the time of “soft materials”, including polymers, colloids, gels, vesicles, emulsions, films, surfactants, micelles, suspensions and liquid crystals. They are essential to produce various electrical &amp; optical devices, and biodevices etc. The soft materials are increasingly indispensable in our daily lives. Since surfaces and interfaces of soft materials“( soft interfaces”) play an important role in various technological applications and bio-interfaces, precise control of soft interfaces would greatly promote the innovation of future science and technology. In this project, we are focusing on the understanding of fundamental science of soft interfaces formed in nature and extract the molecular and structure design principles. The following three groups are organized in order to pursue this project: 1) Precise molecular design of soft interfaces based on precise synthetic chemistry, 2) Hierarchical structural control and fabrication of soft interfaces through understanding natural systems, and 3) Development of in situ and dynamical characterization methods of soft interfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[séance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

{{More footnotes|date=September 2017}}

'''Lexicography''' is divided into two separate but equally important groups:

* '''Practical lexicography''' is the art or [[craft]] of compiling, writing and editing [[dictionary|dictionaries]].
* '''Theoretical lexicography''' is the [[academic disciplines|scholarly discipline]] of analyzing and describing the [[semantic]], [[syntagma (linguistics)|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigm]]atic relationships within the [[lexicon]] (vocabulary) of a [[language]], developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as 'metalexicography'.

There is some disagreement on the definition of [[lexicology]], as distinct from lexicography. Some use "lexicology" as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of [[linguistics]] pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language.

A person devoted to lexicography is called a '''lexicographer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/lexicographer|title=Lexicographer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus ==
General lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of general dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that provide a description of the language in general use. Such a dictionary is usually called a general dictionary or LGP dictionary (Language for General Purpose). Specialized lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that are devoted to a (relatively restricted) set of linguistic and factual elements of one or more specialist subject fields, e.g. [[legal lexicography]]. Such a dictionary is usually called a [[specialized dictionary]] or [[Language for specific purposes dictionary]] and following Nielsen 1994, specialized dictionaries are either multi-field, single-field or sub-field dictionaries.

It is now widely accepted that lexicography is a scholarly discipline in its own right and not a sub-branch of [[applied linguistics]], as the chief object of study in lexicography is the dictionary (see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp 2009).

==Etymology==

Coined in English 1680, the word "lexicography" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] λεξικογράφος ''lexikographos'', "lexicographer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikogra%2Ffos λεξικογράφος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λεξικόν ''lexicon'', neut. of λεξικός ''lexikos'', "of or for words",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λέξις ''lexis'', "speech", "word",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis λέξις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; (in turn from λέγω ''lego'', "to say", "to speak"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw3 λέγω],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) and γράφω ''grapho'', "to scratch, to inscribe, to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgra%2Ffw γράφω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Practical lexicographic work involves several activities, and the compilation of well-crafted dictionaries requires careful consideration of all or some of the following aspects:
* profiling the intended users (i.e. linguistic and non-linguistic competences) and identifying their needs
* defining the communicative and cognitive functions of the dictionary
* selecting and organizing the components of the dictionary
* choosing the appropriate structures for presenting the data in the dictionary (i.e. frame structure, distribution structure, macro-structure, micro-structure and [[cross-reference]] structure)
* selecting words and affixes for systematization as entries
* selecting [[collocation]]s, phrases and examples
* choosing [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] forms for each word or part of word to be lemmatized
* defining words
* organizing definitions
* specifying pronunciations of words
* labeling definitions and pronunciations for [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and dialect, where appropriate
* selecting equivalents in bi- and multi-lingual dictionaries
* translating collocations, phrases and examples in bi- and multilingual dictionaries
* designing the best way in which users can access the data in printed and electronic dictionaries

One important goal of lexicography is to keep the [[lexicographic information cost]]s incurred by dictionary users as low as possible. Nielsen (2008) suggests relevant aspects for lexicographers to consider when making dictionaries as they all affect the users' impression and actual use of specific dictionaries.

Theoretical lexicography concerns the same aspects as lexicography, but aims to develop principles that can improve the quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: 'dictionary criticism' (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 1999)), 'dictionary history' (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), 'dictionary typology' (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), 'dictionary structure' (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), 'dictionary use' (or observing the reference acts and skills of dictionary users), and 'dictionary IT' (or applying [[Dictionary writing system|computer aids]] to the process of dictionary compilation).

One important consideration is the status of 'bilingual lexicography', or the compilation and use of the [[bilingual dictionary]] in all its aspects (see e.g. Nielsen 1894). In spite of a relatively long history of this type of dictionary, it is often said{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} to be less developed in a number of respects than its unilingual counterpart, especially in cases where one of the languages involved is not a major language. Not all genres of reference works are available in interlingual versions, e.g. LSP, learners' and encyclopedic types, although sometimes these challenges produce new subtypes, e.g. 'semi-bilingual' or 'bilingualised' dictionaries such as Hornby's ''(Oxford) Advanced Learner's Dictionary English-Chinese'', which have been developed by translating existing monolingual dictionaries (see Marello 1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Low comedy''', in association to [[comedy]], is a dramatic or literary form of [[entertainment]] with no primary purpose but to create [[laughter]] by [[boasting]], boisterous jokes, [[drunkenness]], scolding, [[fighting]], [[buffoonery]] and other riotous activity.&lt;ref&gt;low comedy. (2013). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349662/low-comedy&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by "horseplay", [[slapstick]] or [[farce]]. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the [[wedgie]].

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays.  Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers.  Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: [[stand-up comedians]], [[musicals]], etc.  This type of comedy also was employed in most [[cartoons]].

== Society ==
Low comedy in [[society]] is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of [[mass media|media]], such as [[television]] and [[theatre]]. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term ''low'' is represented in association to [[low culture]]. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;.  Gans, H. J. (1975). Popular culture and high culture; an analysis and evaluation of taste. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. 

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to [[high comedy]]. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.&lt;ref&gt;By, B. A. (1934, Jan 21). Salute to low comedy. New York Times (1923-Current File). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/101030559&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of [[sitcoms]] in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, M. (1995, Oct 30). Low comedy of 'high society'. USA TODAY. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/408705508&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=April 2014}}  Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15588">The '''Lutz–Kelker bias''' is a supposed [[systematic bias]] that results from the assumption that the number of observable stars increases with the square of the distance. In particular, it causes measured [[parallax]]es to stars to be larger than their actual values. The bias towards measuring larger [[parallax]]es in turn results in an underestimate of distance and therefore an underestimate on the object's [[luminosity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lutz|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Kelker|first2=Douglas H.|year=1973|title=On the Use of Trigonometric Parallaxes for the Calibration of Luminosity Systems: Theory|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/129506|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=85|pages=573|bibcode=1973PASP...85..573L|doi=10.1086/129506|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a given parallax measurement with an accompanying uncertainty, both stars closer and farther may, because of uncertainty in measurement, appear at the given parallax. Assuming uniform stellar distribution, the number of stars per unit range of parallax will be proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/p^4&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the true parallax), and therefore, there will be more stars in the volume shells at farther distance. As a result of this dependence, more stars will have their true parallax smaller than the observed parallax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galactic Astronomy|last=Binney and Merrifield|first=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-691-00402-1|location=Princeton, New Jersey, 08540|pages=115–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the measured parallax will be systematically biased towards a value larger than the true parallax. This causes inferred luminosities and distances to be too small, which poses an apparent problem to astronomers trying to measure distance. The existence (or otherwise) of this bias and the necessity of correcting for it has become relevant in astronomy with the precision parallax measurements made by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite and more recently with the high-precision data releases of the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] mission.

The correction method due to Lutz and Kelker placed a bound on the true parallax of stars. This is not valid because true parallax (as distinct from measured parallax) cannot be known. Integrating over all true parallaxes (all space) assumes that stars are equally visible at all distances, and leads to divergent integrals yielding an invalid calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Francis, Charles|date=11 October 2014|title=The Lutz-Kelker Paradox|journal=MNRAS|volume=444|pages=L6–L10|arxiv=1202.1375|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slu103|bibcode=2014MNRAS.444L...6F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently the Lutz-Kelker correction should not be used. In general, other corrections for systematic bias are required, depending on the selection criteria of the stars under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Francis, Charles|date=1 October 2013|title=Calibration of RAVE distances to a large sample of Hipparcos stars|journal=MNRAS|volume=436|pages=1283–1293|arxiv=1202.1375|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1651|bibcode=2013MNRAS.436.1343F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of effects of the bias are also discussed in the context of the current higher-precision measurements and the choice of stellar sample where the original stellar distribution assumptions are not valid. These differences result in the original discussion of effects to be largely overestimated and highly dependent on the choice of stellar sample. It also remains possible that relations to other forms of statistical bias such as the [[Malmquist bias]] may have a counter-effect on the Lutz–Kelker bias for at least some samples.

== Mathematical Description ==

=== Original Description ===

==== The Distribution Function ====
Mathematically, the '''Lutz-Kelker Bias''' originates from the dependence of the number density on the observed parallax that is translated into the [[conditional probability]] of [[parallax]] measurements. Assuming a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] of the observed parallax about the true parallax due to errors in measurement, we can write the [[conditional probability]] distribution function of measuring a [[parallax]] of &lt;math&gt;p_o&lt;/math&gt; given that the true [[parallax]] is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;g(p_o|p) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma}} \exp{\Big(\dfrac{-(p_o-p)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)}&lt;/math&gt;

since the estimation is of a true parallax based on the measured parallax, the conditional probability of the true parallax being &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, given that the observed parallax is &lt;math&gt;p_o&lt;/math&gt;is of interest. In the original treatment of the phenomenon by Lutz &amp; Kelker, this probability, using [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes theorem]], is given as

&lt;math&gt;g(p|p_o) = \dfrac{g(p_o|p) \ g(p)}{g(p_o)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g(p) dp&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(p_o) dp_o&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Prior probability|prior probabilities]] of the true and observed parallaxes respectively.

==== Dependence on Distance ====
The [[Probability density function|probability density]] of finding a star with [[apparent magnitude]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;s
&lt;/math&gt; can be similarly written as

&lt;math&gt;h(s|m) = \dfrac{h(m|s)\ h(s)}{h(m)}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;h(m|s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Probability density function|probability density]] of finding a star with [[apparent magnitude]] m with a given distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;h(m|s)&lt;/math&gt;  will be dependent on the [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] of the star, which depends on its [[absolute magnitude]]. &lt;math&gt;h(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] of the [[apparent magnitude]] independent of distance. The probability of a star being at distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; will be proportional to &lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;h(s) \propto n(s) \ s^2&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] of stars in space, the number density &lt;math&gt;n(s)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a constant and we can write

&lt;math&gt;g(p) \ dp = h(s|m) \ \Bigg | \dfrac{\partial s}{\partial p} \Bigg |_m \ dp \propto s^2 \Bigg | \dfrac{\partial s}{\partial p} \Bigg |_m dp&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s = 1/p&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we deal with the probability distribution of the true parallax based on a fixed observed parallax, the probability density &lt;math&gt;g(p_o)&lt;/math&gt; becomes irrelevant and we can conclude that the distribution will have the proportionality&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g(p|p_o) \propto  g(p|p_o) \ p^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;  and thus,

&lt;math&gt;g(p|p_o) \propto \dfrac{1}{p^4} \exp\Big({-\dfrac{(p-p_o)^2}{2 \ \sigma^2}}\Big)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Normalization ====
The conditional probability of the true parallax based on the observed parallax is divergent around zero for the true parallax. Therefore, it is not possible to [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]] this probability. Following the original description of the bias,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; we can define a normalization by including the observed parallax as

&lt;math&gt;g(p|p_o) \propto \Big(\dfrac{p_o}{p}\Big)^4 \ \exp\Big({-\dfrac{(p-p_o)^2}{2 \ \sigma^2}}\Big) &lt;/math&gt;

The inclusion of &lt;math&gt;p_o &lt;/math&gt;does not affect proportionality since it is a fixed constant. Moreover, in this defined "[[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]]", we will get a probability of 1 when the true parallax is equal to the observed parallax, regardless of the errors in measurement. Therefore, we can define a dimensionless parallax &lt;math&gt;Z := p/p_o &lt;/math&gt; and get the dimensionless distribution of the true parallax as

&lt;math&gt;G(Z) \propto Z^{-4} \ \exp\Big({-\dfrac{(Z-1)^2}{2 \ (\sigma/ p_o)^2}}\Big) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;Z=1 &lt;/math&gt; represents the point where the measurement in parallax is equal to its true value, where the probability distribution should be centered. However, this distribution, due to &lt;math&gt;Z^{-4} &lt;/math&gt; factor will deviate from the point &lt;math&gt;Z=1 &lt;/math&gt; to smaller values. This presents the systematic '''Lutz-Kelker Bias'''. The value of this bias will be based on the value of &lt;math&gt;\sigma / p_o&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal uncertainty in parallax measurement.

== Scope of Effects ==

=== Original Treatment ===
In the original treatment of the Lutz–Kelker bias as it was first proposed&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the uncertainty in parallax measurement is considered to be the sole source of bias. As a result of the parallax dependence of stellar distributions, smaller uncertainty in the observed parallax will result in only a slight bias from the true parallax value. Larger uncertainties in contrast would yield higher systematic deviations of the observed parallax from its true value. Large errors in parallax measurement become apparent in luminosity calculations and are therefore easy to detect. Consequently, the original treatment of the phenomenon considered the bias to be effective when the uncertainty in the observed parallax, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, is close to about 15% of the measured value, &lt;math&gt;p_o&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was a very strong statement indicating that if the uncertainty in the parallax in about 15-20%, the bias is so effective that we lose most of the parallax and distance information. Several subsequent work on the phenomenon refuted this argument and it was shown that the scope is actually very sample based and may be dependent on other sources of bias. Therefore, more recently it is argued that the scope for most stellar samples is not as drastic as first proposed.

=== Subsequent Discussions ===
Following the original statement, the scope of the effects of the bias, as well as its existence and relative methods of correction have been discussed in many works in recent literature, including subsequent work of Lutz himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Thomas E.|last2=Kelker|first2=Douglas H.|date=1973|title=On the Use of Trigonometric Parallaxes for the Calibration of Luminosity Systems: Theory|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/129506|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|language=en|volume=85|issue=507|pages=573|doi=10.1086/129506|issn=0004-6280|bibcode=1973PASP...85..573L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=H.|date=2003-02-01|title=Is there really a Lutz--Kelker bias?

Moreover, the effects of different distributions of stars in space as well as that of measurement errors would yield different forms of bias.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests the bias is largely dependent on the specific choice of sample and measurement error distributions, although the term Lutz–Kelker bias is commonly used generically for the phenomenon on all stellar samples. It is also questioned whether other sources of error and bias such as the [[Malmquist bias|Malmquist Bias]] actually counter-effect or even cancel the Lutz–Kelker bias, so that the effects are not as drastic as initially described by Lutz and Kelker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haywood|first=Smith, Jr.|date=1987|title=The calibration problem I.

More recently, the effects of the Lutz–Kelker bias became relevant in the context of the high-precision measurements of [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] mission. The scope of effects of Lutz–Kelker bias on certain samples is discussed in the recent [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] data releases, including the original assumptions and the possibility of different distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luri|first=X.|last2=Brown|first2=A.

As a result, it is questioned whether correction methods, including the Lutz-Kelker correction proposed in the original work, are applicable for a given stellar sample, since effects are expected to depend on the stellar distribution. Moreover, following the original description and the dependence of the bias on the measurement errors, the effects are expected to be lower due to the higher precision of current instruments such as [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]].

==History==
The original description of the phenomenon was presented in a paper by [[Thomas E. Lutz]] and [[Douglas H.

The '''Markarian galaxies''' are a class of [[galaxy|galaxies]] that have [[Active galactic nucleus|nuclei]] with excessive amounts of [[ultraviolet]] emissions compared with other galaxies.  [[Benjamin Markarian]] drew attention to these types of galaxies starting in 1963.  The nuclei of the galaxies had a blue colour, associated to stars in the [[stellar classification|classes from O to A]]. This blue core did not match the rest of the galaxy.  The [[Visible spectrum|spectrum]] in detail tends to show a [[Continuous spectrum|continuum]] that Markarian concluded was produced non-[[Thermal radiation|thermally]].  Most of these have [[emission line]]s and are characterized by highly energetic activity.&lt;ref name="Koioian"&gt;

The First Byurakan Survey commenced in 1965 using the [[Schmidt telescope]] at the [[Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory]]. The telescope used a 132&amp;nbsp;cm mirror and 102&amp;nbsp;cm correcting plate.  When this started it was the largest telescope to have a full aperture objective prism.  The purpose of the survey was to find galaxies with an ultraviolet excess.&lt;ref name="mass"&gt;

The optics used were corrected for blue violet. Prisms in this had a low dispersion of 180&amp;nbsp;nm/mm in order not to spread out the galactic core spectrum too much and confuse it with other objects. This permitted classification of galaxies with magnitudes down to 17.5.&lt;ref name="M1989"/&gt; Seventy galaxies with UV-continuum appeared on lists, and the term "Markarian galaxies" came into use.&lt;ref name="M1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M1967"&gt;

==Characteristics==
The catalogues of galaxies included a name, coordinates, spectral type, visible size and morphological type of galaxy.&lt;ref name="M1989"/&gt; A custom designator for the galaxy core of s for star-like or d for diffuse was used, with hybrids of ds or sd.  A digit 1,2 or 3 indicated strong, moderate or weak UV emission.  And a letter "e" was appended if emission lines were apparent. Eleven galaxies had a blue star in the foreground creating the ultraviolet excess, so these galaxies do not really fall into the class.&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March09/Petrosian3/Petrosian2.html|title=The Data|work=Atlas and Database of Markarian Galaxies - Petrosian et al.|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another problem is duplicate entries where Mrk 107 is Mrk 20, Mrk 1318 is Mrk 49, and Mrk 890 is Mrk 503.&lt;ref name="peto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March09/Petrosian3/Petrosian3.html|title=The Optical Database|last=Petrosian|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various objects in this catalogue include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], [[starburst galaxies]], [[H II region]]s, [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], [[BL Lac object]]s and [[quasar]]s.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;  Some objects are actually giant glowing regions of ionized hydrogen in a galaxy including Mrk 59, 71, 86b, 94, 256b, 404, 489b, 1039, 1236, 1315, and 1379a.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;  Other galaxies have black holes shooting hot gas in energetic jets.  Many are variable, showing the brightness comes from a small region.

In [[physics]] and [[mechanics]], '''mass distribution''' is the spatial distribution of [[mass]] within a [[solid]] body. In principle, it is relevant also for [[gas]]es or [[liquid]]s, but on earth their mass distribution is almost homogeneous.

==Astronomy==
In [[astronomy]] mass distribution has decisive influence on the development e.g. of [[nebula]]e, [[star]]s and [[planet]]s.
The mass distribution of a '''solid''' defines its [[center of gravity]] and influences its dynamical behaviour - e.g. the [[oscillation]]s and eventual [[rotation]].

==Mathematical modelling==
A mass distribution can be modeled as a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]. This allows point masses, line masses, surface masses, as well as masses given by a volume density function. Alternatively the latter can be generalized to a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]. For example, a point mass is represented by a [[Dirac delta#Generalizations|delta function defined in 3-dimensional space]]. A surface mass on a surface given by the equation ''f(x,y,z)'' = 0 may be represented by a density distribution ''g(x,y,z) δ (f(x,y,z))'', where &lt;math&gt;g/\mid \nabla f \mid&lt;/math&gt; is the mass per unit area.

The [[mathematical model]]ling can be done by [[potential theory]], by numerical methods (e.g. a great number of [[point mass|mass point]]s), or by theoretical [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] figures.

==Geology==
In [[geology]] the aspects of rock [[density]] are involved.

==Rotating solids==
[[Rotation|Rotating]] solids are affected considerably by the mass distribution, either if they are homogeneous or inhomogeneous - see [[Torque]], [[moment of inertia]], [[wikt:wobble|wobble]], [[:wikt:imbalance|imbalance]] and [[wikt:stability|stability.]]

'''Masturbation''' is the [[sexual stimulation]] of one's own [[Sex organ|genitals]] for [[sexual arousal]] or other sexual pleasure, usually to the point of [[orgasm]].&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jennifer|last=Robinson|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/masturbation-guide |title=Masturbation – Is Masturbation Normal or Harmful? Who Masturbates? Why Do People Masturbate? |publisher=[[WebMD]]|date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulation may involve hands, [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingers]], everyday objects, [[sex toy]]s such as [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]], or combinations of these.&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Based on "masturbation" in ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Manual stimulation of a partner, such as [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]], a [[handjob]] or [[mutual masturbation]], is a common sexual act and can be a substitute for [[sexual penetration|penetration]]. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No [[Causality|causal]] relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=Eli |year=2012|orig-year=2002 | chapter-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150722160223/http://samples.sainsburysebooks.co.uk/9781317787587_sample_833458.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |editor1-last=Bockting |editor1-first=Walter O. |editor2-last=Coleman |editor2-first=Eli |chapter = Masturbation as a Means of Achieving Sexual Health | title=Masturbation as a Means of Achieving Sexual Health |location=New York |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |publication-date= |page=7 |nopp= |isbn=978-0-7890-2047-5 |oclc=50913590 |quote=Despite the scientific evidence indicating that masturbation is generally a normal variant of sexual expression and that it does not seem to have a causal relationship with sexual pathology, negative attitudes about masturbation persist and it remains stigmatized.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times and is mentioned and discussed in very early writings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it as "heinous", "deplorable", and "hideous", but during the 20th century these [[taboo]]s generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. Today, religions vary in their [[Religious views on masturbation|views]] of masturbation; some view it as a spiritually detrimental practice, some see it as not spiritually detrimental, and others take a [[Situational ethics|situational]] view.

== Etymology ==

The English word ''masturbation'' was introduced in the 18th century, based on the Latin verb ''masturbari'', alongside the slightly earlier ''onanism''.
The [[Latin]] verb ''masturbari'' is of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Masturbation|uncertain origin]].  Suggested derivations include an unattested word for [[human penis|penis]], ''*mazdo'', cognate with [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]   ''mézea'' ''μέζεα'', "genitals", or alternatively a corruption of an unattested ''*manusturpare'' ("to defile with the hand"), by association with ''turbare'' "to disturb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dally |first=Peter |title=The Fantasy Factor |year=1975 |page=135 |publisher=George Weidenfeld and Nicolson Limited |isbn=978-0-297-76945-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', s.v. ''[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114847 masturbation]{{subscription required}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

While ''masturbation'' is the formal word for this practice, many other expressions are in common use. Terms such as ''playing with yourself'', ''pleasuring oneself'' and slang such as ''wanking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darby, R. |title=Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation |journal=Journal of Social History |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''jerking off'',&lt;ref&gt;Shamans Sex Beasts and Abuse: Mother-Son Relationships in Popular and Cult Cinema. Charles Jason Lee.  Film International, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Frig (interjection)|frigging]]'' are common. ''Self-abuse'' and ''self-pollution'' were common in early modern times and are still found in modern dictionaries. A large variety of other [[euphemism]]s and [[dysphemism]]s exist which describe masturbation. For a list of terms, see the entry for ''[[wikt:Wikisaurus:masturbate|masturbate]]'' in [[Wiktionary]].

== Techniques ==

[[File:Vibratoren bunt DSCF7424.jpg|thumb|right|Two vibrators in a [[sex shop]]]]

Masturbation involves touching, pressing, rubbing, or massaging a person's [[genital]] area, either with the fingers or against an object such as a [[pillow]]; inserting fingers or an object into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] (see [[anal masturbation]]); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the [[nipple]]s or other [[erogenous zones]] while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply [[personal lubricant|lubricating]] substances to intensify sensation.

Reading or viewing [[pornography]], [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], or other erotic stimuli may lead to a desire for sexual release such as by masturbation.

Some people get [[sexual pleasure]] by inserting objects, such as [[Urethral sounding|urethral sounds]], into the [[urethra]] (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows),&lt;ref name="Alice05"&gt;{{cite web|author="Alice"  |title = Go ask Alice!: Cock-stuffing |publisher = Columbia University, New York |date = 18 February 2005 |url = http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/cock-stuffing |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice known as [[urethral play]] or "sounding".&lt;ref name="BME06"&gt;{{cite web |last = Various authors |title = Urethral Sound |publisher = Body Modification Ezine |date = 21 April 2006 |url = http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Urethral_Sound |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects such as ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury and/or infection.&lt;ref name="JAAPA06"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McPartlin |first1=Daniel |last2=Klausner |first2=Adam P. |last3=Berry |first3=Tristan T. |last4=Mulcahy |first4=Maurice |title=Case report: A foreign body in the urethra |journal=International Journal of Surgery Case Reports |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1052–4 |date=9 September 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.07.017 |pmid=24055017 |pmc=3825963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people masturbate by using [[Fucking machine|machines]] that simulate intercourse.

Men and women may masturbate until they are close to orgasm, stop for a while to reduce excitement, and then resume masturbating. They may repeat this cycle multiple times. This "stop and go" build-up, known as "[[edging (sexual practice)|edging]]", can achieve even stronger orgasms.&lt;ref name="SXED1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Editorials |date=16 March 2004 |url=http://sexeditorials.com/masturbation/male/stop-and-go.html |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101205321/http://sexeditorials.com/masturbation/male/stop-and-go.html |archivedate= 1 January 2012 |df=dmy }} "The Stop-And-Go Masturbation Technique for Men and Women"&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, people quit stimulation just before orgasm to retain the heightened energy that normally comes down after orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margo|last=Woods|url=http://www.onehearttantra.com/uploads/1/0/7/4/10748619/amasturbation_self_love_tantra.pdf |title=Masturbation, Tantra and Self-love |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male ===

Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing.

The most common masturbation technique among males is to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft. This type of stimulation is typically all that is required to achieve [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]]. The speed of the hand motion varies throughout the masturbation session.

Male masturbation techniques may differ between males who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]] and those who have not. Some techniques which may work for one individual can be difficult or uncomfortable for another. For males who have not been circumcised, stimulation of the penis typically comes from the "pumping" of the [[foreskin]], whereby the foreskin is held and slid up and down over the [[glans penis|glans]], which, depending on foreskin length, is completely or partially covered and then uncovered in a rapid motion. The outer foreskin glides smoothly over the inner foreskin. The glans itself may widen and lengthen as the stimulation continues, becoming slightly darker in colour, while the [[Foreskin#Functions|gliding action]] of the foreskin reduces friction. This technique may also be used by some circumcised men who have sufficient excess skin remaining from their circumcision.

For circumcised males, on whom the glans is mostly or completely uncovered, this technique creates more direct contact between the hand and the glans. To avoid friction, irritation and soreness from this resulting friction, some may prefer to use a personal lubricant, [[masturbation cream]], or [[saliva]].

The shaft skin can also be slid back and forth with just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A variation on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a [[simulacrum]], or [[artificial vagina]].

[[Prostate massage]] is one other technique used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Naveed|last=Saleh|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, by stimulating it using a well-lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the [[rectum]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce stronger and more powerful orgasms than  penile stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Stimulating the prostate from outside, via pressure on the [[perineum]], can be pleasurable as well. 

[[Anal masturbation]] without any prostate stimulation, with fingers or otherwise, is also one other technique which some men enjoy. Since the muscles of the anus contract during [[orgasm]], the presence of an object holding the [[sphincter]] open can strengthen the sensation of the contractions and intensify orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sinclair Intimacy Institute|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |title=Discovery: Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613200634/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |archivedate=2002-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice may be pleasurable because of the large number of [[nerve endings]] in the [[Human anus|anal area]], and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the [[sphincter ani externus muscle|anal sphincter muscles]] while inserting the finger. A good quality [[personal lubricant]] is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers.

There are many other variations on male masturbation techniques. Men may also rub or massage the glans, the rim of the glans, and the [[frenular delta]]. Some men place both hands directly on their penis during masturbation, while others may use their free hand to [[fondle]] their [[testicles]], [[nipples]], or other parts of their body.  The nipples are erogenous zones, and vigorous stimulation of them during masturbation usually causes the penis to become erect more quickly than it would otherwise.  Some may keep their hand stationary while pumping into it with pelvic thrusts in order to simulate the motions of [[sexual intercourse]]. Some may lay in the [[prone position]] and rub their genitals against the bed sheet or other surface, a technique called ''prone masturbation''.&lt;ref name="Prone Masturbation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Confidential|first1=Kinsey|title=Prone masturbation a threat?|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/10/prone-masturbation-a-threat-probably-not|website=Indiana Daily Student|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bath or shower a male may direct water via a handheld [[shower]]head at his frenelum, testicles, or perineum. Others may also use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation. 

A somewhat controversial ejaculation control technique is to put pressure on the perineum, about halfway between the [[scrotum]] and the anus, just before ejaculating.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as [[retrograde ejaculation]]).

=== Female ===

{{See also|Fingering (sexual act)}}

Female masturbation involves the stroking or rubbing of a woman's [[vulva]], especially her [[clitoris]], with an [[index finger|index]] or [[middle finger]]s, or both. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to stroke its frontal wall where the [[G-spot]] may be located.&lt;ref name="Keesling99"&gt;{{cite web |last = Keesling |first = Barbara |title = Beyond Orgasmatron |publisher = Psychology Today |date = November 1999|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199911/beyond-orgasmatron |accessdate = 29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, [[dildo]], or [[Ben Wa balls]] can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] is involved, but this is not universal and many women find their [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] sufficient.

Like males, common positions for female masturbation include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing. In a bath or shower a female may direct water via a handheld showerhead at her clitoris, vulva, or perineum. Lying face down one may use the hands, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and "[[dry hump|hump]]" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, a chair, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.  Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against [[underwear]] or other clothing. In the 1920s, [[Havelock Ellis]] reported that turn-of-the-century seamstresses using treadle-operated sewing machines could achieve orgasm by sitting near the edge of their chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Havelock (1927), Studies in the Psychology of Sex (3rd edition), Volume I,; Auto-Eroticism: A Study of the Spontaneous Manifestations of the Sexual Impulse; section I; "The Sewing-machine and the Bicycle:" quotes one Pouillet as saying "it is a well-recognized fact that to work a sewing-machine with the body in a certain position produces sexual excitement leading to the orgasm. The occurrence of the orgasm is indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds with uncontrollable rapidity. This sound is said to be frequently heard in large French workrooms, and it is part of the duty of the superintendents of the rooms to make the girls sit properly." {{Gutenberg|no=13610|name=Studies in the Psychology of Sex, v. I, by Havelock Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women can stimulate themselves sexually by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.&lt;ref name="Koedt70"&gt;{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = https://www.cwluherstory.org/classic-feminist-writings-articles/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm |accessdate = 18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kins&gt;The Kinsey Institute [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html#masturbation Data from Alfred Kinsey's studies]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081833/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html |date=26 October 2007 }}.

Sex therapists will sometimes recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, for example to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically pleasing to them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy.&lt;ref name="Shuman06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles02"/&gt;

'''Mutual masturbation''' involves two or more people who sexually stimulate each other, usually with the hands. It can be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]], and can be part of other sexual activity. It may be used as [[foreplay]], or as an alternative to sexual penetration. When used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, the goal may be to preserve [[virgin]]ity or to avoid risk of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11&amp;lpg=PT11] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 47–49] for views on what constitutes virginity loss and therefore sexual intercourse or other sexual activity; source discusses how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in penile-vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Mutual masturbation can be practiced in pairs or groups with or without actually touching another person for example:
;Non-contact mutual masturbation: Two people masturbating in the presence of each other but not touching.
;Contact mutual masturbation: One person touching another person to masturbate. The other person may do the same during or after.
;Non-contact group: More than two people masturbating in the presence of each other in a group but not touching each other.
;Contact group: More than two people physically touching each other to masturbate as a group.

== Frequency, age, and sex ==

Frequency of masturbation is determined by many factors, e.g., one's resistance to [[sexual tension]], [[hormone]] levels influencing [[sexual arousal]], sexual habits, peer influences, health and one's attitude to masturbation formed by culture; E. Heiby and J. Becker examined the latter.&lt;ref name=Heiby80&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01542263|last1=Heiby|first1=Elaine|last2=Becker |first2=James D.|date=April 1980|title=Effect of filmed modeling on the self-reported frequency of masturbation|journal=Arch.

Different studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans. [[Alfred Kinsey|Alfred Kinsey's]] 1950s studies on US population&lt;!--what age, location--&gt; have shown that 92% of men and 62% of women have masturbated during their lifespan.&lt;ref name="kins" /&gt; Similar results have been found in a 2007 British national probability survey. It was found that, between individuals aged 16 to 44, 95% of men and 71% of women masturbated at some point in their lives. 73% of men and 37% of women reported masturbating in the four weeks before their interview, while 53% of men and 18% of women reported masturbating in the previous seven days.&lt;ref name=gerr&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerressu | first=Makeda | last2=Mercer | first2=Catherine H. | last3=Graham | first3=Cynthia A. | last4=Wellings | first4=Kaye | last5=Johnson | first5=Anne M. | title=Prevalence of Masturbation and Associated Factors in a British National Probability Survey | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=37 | issue=2 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9123-6 | pages=266–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship. Contrary to this belief, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse. A study has reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship.&lt;ref name=gerr /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heilborn Cabral 2006 pp. 1471–1481"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Heilborn | first=Maria Luiza | last2=Cabral | first2=Cristiane S. | title=Sexual practices in youth: analysis of lifetime sexual trajectory and last sexual intercourse | journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública | publisher=FapUNIFESP (SciELO) | volume=22 | issue=7 | year=2006 | issn=0102-311X | doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2006000700011 | pages=1471–1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Menon Williams Watson pp. 125–127"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Menon | first=Anuradha | last2= McAllister-Williams | first2=R.

== Evolutionary utility ==
Female masturbation alters conditions in the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on the timing of the masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such an orgasm can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Baker |first = Robin |title = Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex |publisher = Diane Books Publishing Company |date=June 1996 |isbn = 978-0-7881-6004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females&gt;{{cite journal |last = Baker |first = Robin R. |author2=Bellis, Mark A. |date=November 1993 |title = Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm |journal = Animal Behaviour |volume = 46 |issue = 5 |pages = 87, 23p |doi = 10.1006/anbe.1993.1272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix.&lt;ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females /&gt;

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. "Self-abuse," as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth &amp; Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as "bad" or "wrong."

Mutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the "map to [their] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. Intercourse, by itself, is often inconvenient or impractical at times to provide sufficient sexual release for many people. Mutual masturbation allows couples to enjoy each other and obtain sexual release as often as they need but without the inconveniences and risks associated with sex.&lt;ref name="BadgerHerald" /&gt;

Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had significantly lower risk. However they could not show a direct causation. The study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases (STDs) that may increase the [[Cervical cancer#Causes|risk of cancer]] instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent ejaculation between the ages of 20 and 40 may be correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, frequent ejaculation in one's 50s was found to be correlated with a lower such risk in this same study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Polyxeni Dimitropoulou | author2=Douglas Easton | author3=Richard Pocock | author4=David P.

A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.

{{quote|quote=The association between frequency of orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recorded as number of orgasms per year. The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95).}}
That is, a difference in mortality appeared between any two subjects when one subject ejaculated at around two times per week more than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3 and 5 ejaculations per week for healthy males, this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer.

Solo masturbation is a sexual activity that is free of risk of [[sexually transmitted infections]]. With two or more participants, the risk of sexually transmitted infections, while not eliminated, is much less than with most forms of [[penetrative sex]]. Support for such a view, and for making masturbation part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] [[Joycelyn Elders]] during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]. Some [[European Union|EU Nations]] promote masturbation in their sex education curricula.

In general, real sex slightly increases energy consumption, according to a study published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Charles Redmon |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/01/bad_news_sex_doesnt_burn_that_many_calories_partner/ |title=Bad news: Sex doesn't burn that many calories |publisher=Salon.com |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krista Casazza ''et. al'' |title=Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity |date=31 January 2013 |journal=N.

=== Risks ===

Those who insert objects as aids to masturbation risk them becoming stuck (e.g. as [[rectal foreign body|rectal foreign bodies]]). Men and women can fall prey to this problem. A woman went into a German hospital with two pencils in her bladder, having pierced her urethra after inserting them during masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wegner|first=HE|author2=Franke M |author3=Schick V. |date=May 1997|title=Endoscopic removal of intravesical pencils using percutaneous nephrolithotomy sheath and forceps|journal=[[Journal of Urology]]|issue=5|volume=157|page=1842|pmid=9112540|url=http://www.masturbationhorror.com/women.shtml&lt;!-- more direct link needed --&gt;|doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(01)64878-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Solo masturbation, or masturbation involving individuals of the same sex, cannot produce pregnancy. Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see ''[[Non-penetrative sex#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]]'') can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva.

If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection. The child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or understimulated and bored. 

Alongside many other factors—such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play and precocious or seductive behavior—excessive masturbation may be an indicator of [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

The [[Human sexuality|sexual]] stimulation of one's own [[sex organ|genitals]] has been [[Religious views on masturbation|interpreted variously by different religions]], the subject of legislation, social controversy, activism, as well as intellectual study in [[sexology]]. Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history.

There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric [[rock painting]]s around the world. From the earliest records, the ancient [[Sumer]]ians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|chapter-url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Men would often use ''puru''-oil, a special oil probably mixed with pulverized [[iron ore]] intended to enhance friction.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Masturbation was also an act of creation and, in [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], the god [[Enki]] was believed to have created the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty [[Stream bed|riverbeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|page=32|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also regarded masturbation by a deity as an act of creation; the god [[Atum]] was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation.

====18th century====
''Onanism'' is a hybrid term which combines the proper noun, ''[[Onan]]'', with the suffix, ''-ism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Onanism." ''The Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 16 July. 2017. &lt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Onanism&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notions of self-pollution, impurity and uncleanness were increasingly associated with various other sexual vices and crimes of the body (such fornication, sodomy, adultery, incest and obscene language); in reaction to the 17th-century libertine culture, middle-class moralists increasingly campaigned for a reformation of manners and a stricter regulation of the body. Paradoxically, a crime that was secret and private became a popular and fashionable topic. Moreover, writers tended to focus more on the perceived links with mental and physical illnesses that were deemed to be associated with the sense of moral outrage. Attention increasingly shifted to the prevention and cure of this illness which perilously sapped men of their virility&lt;ref&gt;See ''Traité contre l’impureté'' (1707) and ''The Nature of Uncleanness'' (1708); Ian McCormick ed. ''Sexual Outcasts: Onanism''. Vol. 4. (London and New York: Routledge, 2000). pp. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716 and attributed&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, David and Emma Ellis. ''Resolution: Two Brothers. A Nation in Crisis. A World at War.'' London: Head of Zeus. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to Dutch theologian Dr. [[Balthazar Bekker]], titled "Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." The Online Etymology Dictionary, however, claims the earliest known use of ''onanism'' occurred in 1727. In 1743–45, the British physician [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]] published ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. ''Masturbation: the history of a great terror''. New York: Palgrave, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56 pp. 56–57]. {{ISBN|0-312-22443-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in ''Onania'' was the notable Swiss physician [[Samuel-Auguste Tissot]]. In 1760, he published ''L'Onanisme'', his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered [[hypothesis|conjectural]] at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent.

Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797), he made the ''[[a posteriori]]'' argument that "such an unnatural use of one's sexual attribute" strikes "everyone upon his thinking of it" as "a violation of one's duty to himself", and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that "it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use", but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that "a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Emmanuel|title=The Metaphysics of Morals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56673-5|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcrTG6tJsAC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Mary J.

====19th century====

By 1838 [[Jean Esquirol]] had declared in his ''Des Maladies Mentales'' that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Hare (1962) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/108/452/1.full.pdf Masturbatory Insanity: The History of an Idea], [[Journal of Mental Science]] 108:4 (issue #452)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], pages 65,6&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor [[John Harvey Kellogg]] and [[Sylvester Graham|Rev. Sylvester Graham]] were among those who proposed that [[circumcision]] and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link1=John Harvey Kellogg |last1=Kellogg |first1=John Harvey |title=Plain Facts for Old And Young|page=325|year=1910|hdl=2027/ucw.ark:/13960/t53f53t5w }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, [[infibulation]], restraining devices like [[chastity belt]]s and [[straitjacket]]s, [[cauterization]] or – as a last resort – wholesale [[Castration|surgical excision]] of the genitals.

Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change towards the end of the 19th century when [[H. Havelock Ellis]], in his seminal 1897 work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', questioned Tissot's premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |first2=Anne |last2=van Neck|title=Masturbation: the history of a great terror |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133|isbn=978-0-312-22443-1 | year=2001 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====

In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] addressed masturbation in his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' and associated it with addictive substances.  He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty.  At the same time, the supposed medical condition of [[female hysteria|hysteria]]&amp;mdash;from the Greek ''hystera'' or uterus&amp;mdash;was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women.  In 1910, the meetings of the [[Vienna psychoanalytic circle]] discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation,&lt;ref name="Bennett 1999 pp. 269–294"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bennett | first=David | title=Burghers, Burglars, and Masturbators: The Sovereign Spender in the Age of Consumerism | journal=New Literary History | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=30 | issue=2 | year=1999 | issn=1080-661X | doi=10.1353/nlh.1999.0018 | pages=269–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its publication on the matter was suppressed. [[Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation]] is a 1922 [[essay]] by another [[Austrians|Austrian]], the [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Wilhelm Reich]]. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of [[unconscious fantasy]] and the subsequent emerging [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.

By 1930, Dr. [[F. W. W. Griffin]], editor of ''The Scouter,'' had written in a book for [[Rover Scouts]] stating that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing [[H. Havelock Ellis|Ellis]]' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error." The work of sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the [[Kinsey Reports]], insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females.  In the US masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] II (1968).&lt;ref name="Ley2014"/&gt;

In the 1980s [[Michel Foucault]] was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children". However, in 1994, when the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], Dr. [[Joycelyn Elders]], mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school [[curriculum|curricula]] that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jeff|last1=Jelq|url=http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/elders.html |title=JackinLibrary: Joycelyn Elders |publisher=Jackinworld.com |date= |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of ''how'' to masturbate.

====21st century====

Both practices and cultural views of masturbation have continued to evolve in the 21st Century, partly because the contemporary [[lifeworld]] is increasingly technical.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}}  For example, digital photographs or live video may be used to share masturbatory experiences either in a broadcast format (possibly in exchange of money, as with performances by "[[camgirl]]s" and "[[camboy]]s"), or between members of a [[long-distance relationship]]. [[Teledildonics]] is a growing field.  Masturbation has been depicted as a not-uncomplicated part of "Love in the 21st Century" in the BBC drama by the same name.&lt;ref name="channel4.com 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=Love in the 21st Century - Episode Guide - Channel 4 | website=channel4.com | date=2009-06-16 | url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616081408/https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-date=2009-06-16 | dead-url=yes | access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern culture ==

=== Sperm donation ===

Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |title=Donor insemination – how does it work? |publisher=Hfea.gov.uk |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008094517/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sperm-donation/basics/definition/prc-20009520 |title=Sperm donation Definition – Tests and Procedures |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as artificial insemination. Most semen used for [[sperm donation]], and all semen donated through a sperm bank by sperm donors, is produced in this way. The facility at a sperm bank used for this purpose is known as a masturbatorium (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OHasan |url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/siw198q/websites/reprotech/New%20Ways%20of%20Making%20Babies/spermint.htm |title=What Does Sperm Donation Involve? |publisher=Web.stanford.edu |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encouraged masturbation ===

In the UK in 2009, a leaflet was issued by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in [[Sheffield]] carrying the slogan, "an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away". It also says: "Health promotion experts advocate five portions of fruit and veg a day and 30 minutes' physical activity three times a week. What about sex or masturbation twice a week?" This leaflet has been circulated to parents, teachers and youth workers and is meant to update sex education by telling older school students about the benefits of enjoyable sex. Its authors have said that for too long, experts have concentrated on the need for "safe sex" and committed relationships while ignoring the principal reason that many people have sex. The leaflet is entitled ''Pleasure''. Instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience, said one of its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Spanish region of [[Extremadura]] launched a programme in 2009 to encourage "sexual self-exploration and the discovery of self-pleasure" in people aged from 14 to 17. The €14,000 campaign includes leaflets, flyers, a "fanzine", and workshops for the young in which they receive instruction on masturbation techniques along with advice on contraception and self-respect. The initiative, whose slogan is, "Pleasure is in your own hands" has angered local right-wing politicians and challenged traditional Roman Catholic views. Officials from the neighbouring region of [[Andalucia]] have expressed an interest in copying the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The text book ''Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life'' states, "Terminally ill people are likely no different from the general population regarding their masturbation habits. Palliative care practitioners should routinely ask their patients if anything interferes in their ability to masturbate and then work with the patient to correct the problem if it is identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matzo|first=Marianne |title=Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life|year=2006|publisher=Springer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8261-5791-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rTexGiX5bqoC&amp;pg=PA70|author2=Deborah Witt Sherman|accessdate=26 May 2010|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===

The prosecution of masturbation has varied at different times, from virtually unlimited acceptance to complete illegality. In a 17th-century law code for the [[Puritan]] colony of [[New Haven Colony|New Haven, Connecticut]] "[[blasphemy|blasphemers]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and masturbators" were eligible for the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Often, masturbation in the sight of others is prosecuted under a general law such as [[public indecency]], though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2013-09-19"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Masturbation laws around the world: the penal code|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/blog/2013/sep/19/masturbation-laws-world-penal-code|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, laws vary from state to state.

In many jurisdictions, masturbation by one person of another is considered [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] which may be illegal in some cases, such as when the other person is a minor.

There is debate whether masturbation should be promoted in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany masturbation, are common in [[Incarceration in the United States|American correctional facilities]]. [[Connecticut Department of Correction]]s officials say that these restrictions are intended to avoid a [[hostile work environment]] for [[correctional officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connecticut Prisoners Express Anger Over Porn Ban|author=Eaton-Robb, Pat|date=8 October 2011|url=http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2011/10/08/connecticut-prisoners-express-anger-over-porn-ban/|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers argue allowing masturbation could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in [[prison rape]] or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Free Willy|author=Johns, David Merritt|date=10 January 2012|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/01/should_prison_inmates_have_the_right_to_masturbate_.single.html|publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions vary broadly in their views of masturbation, from considering it completely impermissible ([[Religious views on masturbation#Catholicism|as in Roman Catholicism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action."The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose". For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved".

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encouraging and refining it (as, for example, in some [[Neotantra]] and [[Taoist sexual practices]]).

=== Rites of passage ===

The [[Sambia people|Sambia]] tribe of [[New Guinea]] has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which lasts several years and involves ejaculation through [[fellatio]] often several times a day. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Moffatt|url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |title=The Sambia |publisher=Faculty.mdc.edu |date=4 October 1999 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050114/http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |archivedate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2013}}

Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hewlett, B.S. |chapter=Diverse contexts of human infancy |editor=Ember, C. |editor2=Ember, M. |title=Cross-Cultural Research for Social Science |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs NJ |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a "wise elder" or "witch doctor" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size.

=== Stigma ===

Even though many [[medical]] professionals and [[scientist]]s have found large amounts of evidence that masturbating is healthy&lt;ref name="Merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szasz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shpancer2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sigel2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strassberg2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ley2014" /&gt; and commonly practiced by males and females, stigma on the topic still persists today.

=== Music ===
In popular music, there are various songs that deal with masturbation.

The song "Masturbates" by rock group [[Mindless Self Indulgence]] also deals with the concept of auto-erotic activity in a [[punk subculture|punk]] framework.

=== Literature ===

The 1858 schoolboys' novel ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' was a tract against masturbation, but did not mention the subject except extremely obliquely as "[[Kibroth-Hattaavah]]" a place mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] where those that lusted after meat were buried.

In October 1972, an important censorship case was held in Australia, leading to the banning of [[Philip Roth|Philip Roth's]] novel ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' in that country due to its masturbation references. The censorship led to public outcry at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Don Chipp: larrikin, censor, and party founder |date=August 2006 |publisher=Crikey  |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2006/08/29/don-chipp-larrikin-censor-and-party-founder/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further portrayals and references to masturbation have occurred throughout literature, and the practice itself has even contributed to the production of literature among certain writers, such as [[Thomas Wolfe|Wolfe]], [[Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and [[John Cheever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2013/daily_rituals/balzac_and_sex_how_the_french_novelist_used_masturbation_to_fuel_his_writing.html |title = Daily Rituals |last = Currey |first = Mason |date = 30 April 2013 |journal = Slate |accessdate=  10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perhaps the most famous fictional depiction of masturbation occurs in the "Nausicaa" episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce. Here the novel's protagonist Bloom brings himself to covert climax during a public fireworks display after being aroused by a young woman's coy exhibitionism.

In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Contest]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Seinfeld,' Four: It's Real and It's Spectacular |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/16/AR2005051600756.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=17 May 2005 |first=Jen |last=Chaney}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show's main characters enter into a contest to see who can go the longest without masturbating. Because ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s network, [[NBC]], did not think masturbation was a suitable topic for prime-time television, the word is never used. Instead, the subject is described using a series of euphemisms. "Master of my domain" became a part of the American lexicon from this episode.

Another NBC show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', had a character known as the Masturbating Bear, a costume of a bear with a diaper covering its genitals. The Masturbating Bear would touch his diaper to simulate masturbation. Prior to leaving ''Late Night'' to become host of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'', [[Conan O'Brien]] originally retired the character due to concerns about its appropriateness in an earlier time slot.&lt;ref name="warmingglow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2009/05/the-masturbating-bear-is-coming-back/ |title=The masturbating bear is coming back!!! |publisher=warmingglow.uproxx.com |accessdate=8 November 2013 |date=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Masturbating Bear however made his ''Tonight Show'' debut during the final days of Conan O'Brien's tenure as host of the ''Tonight Show''.  It was clear by then that Conan O'Brien was being removed from the show and he spent his last shows pushing the envelope with skits that typically would not be appropriate for the ''Tonight Show'', one of which was the Masturbating Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stableford |first=Dylan |url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/conan-finally-unleashes-masturbating-bear-video-13333 |title='Conan Finally Unleashes 'Masturbating Bear'&amp;#39; |publisher=Thewrap.com |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After much debate on whether or not he would be able to be used on Conan O'Brien's new [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', the Masturbating Bear made an appearance on the very first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/masturbating-bear-gets-new-job |title=Conan: Masturbating Bear Gets a New Job |publisher=Tbs.com |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007 the UK broadcaster [[Channel 4]] was to air a season of [[television]] programmes about masturbation, called [[Wank Week]]. (''Wank'' is a [[British English|Briticism]] for ''masturbate''.) The series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials. However, its constituent films may yet be shown by the channel at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 February 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4|accessdate=2 November 2007| title='Wank week' postponed|author=Jason Deans|work= [[Media Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}

=== Pornography ===

Depictions of male and female masturbation are common in pornography, including [[gay pornography]]. ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910), one of the earliest [[pornographic film]]s that have been collected at the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]],&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;Jon Lewis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4OBepfVJOeEC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=1910+%22Am+Abend+%22&amp;hl=en ''Hollywood V.

Solo performances in gay pornography have been described in 1985 as "either or both active (tense, upright) and/or passive (supine, exposed, languid, available)", whereas female solo performances are said to be "exclusively passive (supine, spread, seated, squatted, orifices offered, etc.)".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Waugh, "[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC30folder/PornWaugh.html Men's Pornography: Gay vs. Straight]", ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'', no. 30, March 1985, pp. 30–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Solo pornography recognized with [[AVN Awards]] include the ''[[All Alone (pornographic films)|All Alone]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;"[http://avnawards.avn.com/past/winners/2010 2010 Winners] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20131207095914/http://avnawards.avn.com/past/winners/2010 |date=7 December 2013 }}", ''AVN Awards'', URL accessed 25 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''All Natural: Glamour Solos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.avn.com/articles/video/AVN-Announces-the-2012-AVN-Award-Winners-461715.html AVN – AVN Announces the 2012 AVN Award Winners].

[[File:Max-Planck-Institut.jpg|thumbnail|Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches und internationales Strafrecht}}) is a non-university research institute located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The institute is part of the [[Max Planck Society]] and is conducting basic research into [[criminal law]] and [[criminology]].

The Institute is currently headed by [[Hans-Jörg Albrecht]] (criminology) and [[Ulrich Sieber]] (criminal law). In 2006, the Institute had a total of 149 employees, including 30 researchers and 51 young researchers, as well as 20 third-party employees and 41 visiting researchers. The library comprises more than 400,000 titles and is one of the largest libraries in the area. A former director is [[Albin Eser]].

== History ==
The history of the Institute dates back to 1938, when by [[Adolf Schönke]] held the "Seminar for Foreign and International Criminal Law" at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]]. This led to the founding of the "Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law" in 1947. The Institute was renamed in 1966, when it joined the Max Planck Society.

The '''Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro''' (in [[English language|English]], '''Rio de Janeiro Museum of Image and Sound''') was inaugurated on September 3, 1965, as part of celebrations of the fourth centenary of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The '''MIS''' is a museum of the Secretary of Culture of the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] dedicated to ''[[carioca]]'' culture.

The institution has launched a pioneering gender audiovisual museum, which would be followed in other Brazilian cities. In addition to having qualified as music and picture documentation center, it was also a cultural center of avant-garde in the 1960s and 1970s, a place of meetings and launching new ideas and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museusdorio.com.br/joomla/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=144:funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o-museu-da-imagem-e-do-som-do-rio-de-janeiro|title=Fundação Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro

The building of the new headquarters of MIS, in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]] was announced in 2009, in the place of the old nightclub ''Help'', an old point of prostitution in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1358705-5606,00-FREQUENTADORES+E+FUNCIONARIOS+LAMENTAM+FECHAMENTO+DA+BOATE+HELP.html|title=Frequentadores e funcionários lamentam fechamento da boate Help

== History ==
In addition to the safekeeping and preservation of the collections, the MIS produces its own collection by collecting testimonies for posterity, project conceived in 1966 as a way to legitimize the action of the museum in the cultural milieu of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Currently, the museum has a collection of more than 900 interviews with approximately four thousand hours of recording covering the various segments of culture. The MIS is not restricted to guard remaining objects from the past, but it is up to date with the present and facing the future. Records and preserves the memory by making use of technologies available each season. The museum, which currently has its collections split between two locations – one in Praça XV (Centro) and the other in [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]] – is seen as an important part of Rio’s cultural heritage.

== New Museu da Imagem e do Som ==
[[File:Novo Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro (2014).jpg|thumb|250px|Facade of the new museum in June 2014.]]
The plans for the new MIS are ambitious and building costs are said to be in the region of [[R$]]70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1453733-5606,00.html|title=Museu da Imagem e do Som terá boate no lugar da Help

The new headquarters of the Museum of Image and Sound will celebrate the culture and musical history of [[Rio de Janeiro]] throughout its eight floors. The first floor of the building will be dedicated to humor and irreverence Rio, while the second floor will tell the history of music in the city, including [[samba]] and [[choro]]. The third floor will honor Brazilian television as well as [[Carmen Miranda]], incorporating the entire museum collection dedicated to the singer, currently located at [[Flamengo Park|Parque do Flamengo]]. In other floors, visitors circulate through images of the urban evolution of the city. The museum's basement will house a multipurpose room, and the terrace receive outdoor cinema sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-real-estate/mis-museum-in-copacabana-is-delayed-again/#|title=MIS Museum in Copacabana is Delayed Again|publisher=riotimesonline.com/|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new headquarters of the museum is an achievement of the Government of Rio de Janeiro, through the Secretary of State for Culture, with the support of the Secretary of State for Works/Public Works Company (EMOP), made in partnership with the [[Roberto Marinho |Roberto Marinho Foundation]].

The project has direct investment of the Government of Rio de Janeiro, through its own resources and of the State Law of Cultural Incentive, and financing of the Tourism Development Program (PRODETUR) and Investment Support United (PROINVEST).

[[File:Museum Quintana - Unternberg 1.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction (model) of the Künzing-Unternberg rondel, Museum Quintana, [[Künzing]], Lower Bavaria]]

Approximately 120&amp;ndash;150 [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[earthwork (archaeology)|earthworks]] [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]] are known in [[Central Europe]].
They are called '''''Kreisgrabenanlagen'''''  ("circular ditched enclosures") in German, or alternatively as '''roundels''' (or "rondels"; German ''Rondelle''; sometimes also "rondeloid", since many are not even approximately circular). They are mostly confined to the [[Elbe]] and [[Danube]] basins, in  modern-day [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], as well as the adjacent parts of [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]],  in a stretch of [[Central Europe]]an land some 800&amp;nbsp;km (500&amp;nbsp;mi) across.&lt;ref&gt;map in Daim and Neubauer 2005, p. 14; reprinted in Plath 2011, p. 24. Main distribution is between the [[Danube Bend]] and the middle [[Elbe]], say between Budapest and Brunswick (800 km). Including outliers, the area is somewhat larger, encompassing most of [[Central Europe]], stretching over some 1100 km from the [[Danube-Drava National Park|Danube-Drava]] confluence to the lower Rhine (Ruhr area).&lt;/ref&gt;
They date to the first half of the 5th millennium  BC; they are  associated with the late [[Linear Pottery culture]] and its local successors, the [[Stroke-ornamented ware culture|Stroke-ornamented ware (Middle Danubian)]] and  [[Lengyel culture|Lengyel (Moravian Painted Ware)]]  cultures.  The best known and oldest of these Circular Enclosures is the [[Goseck circle]], constructed c. 4900 BC.

Only a few examples approximate a circular form; the majority are only very approximately circular or elliptic. One example at Meisternthal is an exact ellipse with identifiable focal points.
The distribution of these structures seems to suggest a spread from the middle Danube (southern Slovakia and western Hungary) towards the west ([[Lower Austria]], [[Lower Bavaria]]) along the Danube and to the northwest ([[Moravia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]]) following the [[Elbe]]. 
They precede the comparable circular [[henge|earthwork]] or [[Timber circle|timber]] enclosures known from [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], constructed much later during c. 3000 to 1000 BC (late Neolithic to Bronze Age).
But, by contrast to the long lifetime of the "Megalithic" culture, the time window during which the  
neolithic ''Roundels'' were in use is surprisingly narrow, lasting only for about 200&amp;ndash;300 years (roughly 49th to 47th centuries BC).&lt;ref&gt;Holger Dambeck, [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/aelteste-hochkultur-europas-wirbel-um-angebliche-archaeologie-sensation-a-360246.html Wirbel um angebliche Archäologie-Sensation], ''Spiegel Online'',  13 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest roundel to be described was the one at Krpy ([[Kropáčova Vrutice]]), Bohemia,  by [[:cs:Jan Nepomuk Woldřich|Woldřich]] 1886, but it was only with systematic aerial survey in the 1980s and the 1990s that their ubiquity in the region became apparent. 
Three types have been distinguished:
*two semicircular ditches forming a circle and separated by causeways at opposing entrances.
* multiple circuits of ditches interrupted with entrances at cardinal or  astronomically-oriented points and also having an internal single or double timber [[palisade]]. 
* a single [[ring ditch]].

The structures are mostly interpreted as having served a [[Neolithic religion|cultic purpose]].
Most of them are aligned and seem to have served the function of a [[calendar]]  (''Kalenderbau''), in the context of [[archaeoastronomy]] sometimes dubbed "observatory", with openings aligned with the points sunrise and/or sunset at the [[solstice]]s. This is the case with the "gates" or openings of the roundels of  Quenstedt, Goseck and Quedlinburg. 
The observational determination of the time of solstice would not have served a practical (agricultural) purpose, but could have been used to maintain a [[lunisolar calendar]] (i.e. knowledge of the date of solstice allows an accurate handling of [[intercalary month]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schwarz, ''Kreisgrabenanlagen der Stichbandkeramikkultur in Sachsen-Anhalt'', Neolithic Circular Enclosures in Europe, International Workshop in Goseck (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) 7.-9.

'''Northeast Maritime Institute''' (also called NMI) is a [[Private university|private]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]], maritime college offering an Associate in Applied Science in Nautical Science degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.edu/foradmin/academic/independentpurview.asp|title=Academic Program Approval &amp; Review / Massachusetts Department of Higher Education|last=Education|first=Massachusetts Department of Higher|website=www.mass.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1981, Northeast Maritime Institute is the only private maritime college in the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newbedfordguide.com/northeast-maritime-institute/2015/06/17|title=World class Northeast Maritime Institute offers locals career opportunities within the maritime industry – New Bedford Guide|website=www.newbedfordguide.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The college is in the Town of [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]], Massachusetts located in the [[United States]] and is within walking distance from the [[Acushnet River]] across from New Bedford Harbor.  The college was originally established to provide an alternative to traditional maritime academy regimented-styled training and graduates of the college’s Associate program are eligible to receive a United States Coast Guard Masters license upon graduation.  The college operates a training ship, the m/v Navigator, as well as the [[brigantine]] [[tall ship]] [http://www.sailtraining.org/membervessels/vessel.php?@=254 m/s Fritha]. 

== History ==
Northeast Maritime Institute was founded in 1981 as the Tidewater School of Navigation, Inc. in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], Massachusetts.  The school originally provided only continuing education courses and programs approved by the [[United States Coast Guard]] prior to becoming a college.  In 1997 the school was renamed Northeast Maritime Institute and later moved its location to Fairhaven, Massachusetts where its main campus building is located today.  Since its relocation the school has grown to four campus buildings all within walking distance and located within the center of Fairhaven.

In 2008, the Institute launched The Fairhaven Project through a public-private partnership with the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] to advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine.  The program brought groups of Israeli and Palestinian students to Fairhaven where they would work together onboard the brigantine tall ship m/s Fritha.  A 30-minute documentary of the 2008 program was created and utilized by U.S. Embassies and Consulates in the Middle East and other regions of conflict to stimulate student discussions and extend a message of equality and understanding to a larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/oes/rls/fs/2009/119487.htm|title=The Fairhaven Project: Israeli &amp; Palestinian Youths Sail Tall Ship for Peace|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northeast Maritime Institute delivers a range of on-line maritime education and training programs through its Learning Management System “NEMO°” (also called Northeast Maritime Online).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://northeastmaritimeonline.com|title=Northeast Maritime Online (NEMO) Education and Examination System|website=northeastmaritimeonline.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online education and training system was designed so that seafarers could complete training at sea rather than during their shore leave.

In 2018, Northeast Maritime Institute entered into a partnership program with the University of Virgin Islands for development of a degree program in maritime management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stthomassource.com/content/2018/06/03/uvi-board-oks-new-maritime-degree/|title=UVI Board OKs New Maritime Degree|last=staff|first=Source|date=2018-06-04|website=St. Thomas Source|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic programs ==

=== Nautical science ===
The Institute’s College of Nautical Science is a [[Merchant navy|merchant marine]] college intended to prepare students to work onboard ships as [[Deck department|deck officers]] and [[Sea captain|captains]] upon graduation.  In addition to completing all shore-side college classes, students are required to complete two “Semesters at Sea” whereby they work onboard U.S. flagged commercial vessels.  Students may elect to complete their Semesters at Sea onboard any vessel that meets program requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northeastmaritime.com/collegeofmaritimescience/|title=Maritime College  {{!}}  Northeast Maritime Institute|website=www.northeastmaritime.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury that created the list was composed of [[Willy Pedersen]] (chair), [[Andreas Hompland]], [[Cathrine Holst]], Ida Hjelde, and Ola Korsnes. The criteria for selection were "professional originality and quality, professional impact, social impact, craftsmanship and methodological soundness, and literary value."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sosiologen.no/hva-er-sosiologi/636-2/ Pedersen, Eirin.

'''Nutrient pollution,''' a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of [[eutrophication]] of [[surface water]]s, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]], stimulate [[algae|algal]] growth. Sources of nutrient pollution include [[surface runoff]] from farm fields and pastures, discharges from [[septic tank]]s and [[feedlot]]s, and [[air pollution|emissions]] from combustion. Excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to:
* Population effects: excess growth of algae (blooms);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms |title=Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community effects: species composition shifts (dominant taxa); 
* Ecological effects: food web changes, light limitation; 
* Biogeochemical effects: excess organic carbon (eutrophication); dissolved oxygen deficits ([[hypoxia (environmental)|environmental hypoxia]]); toxin production;&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-environment |title=The Effects: Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-07 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human health effects: excess nitrate in drinking water ([[blue baby syndrome]]); disinfection by-products in drinking water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health |title=The Effects: Human Health |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biodiversity effects: excessive algae blooms ([[biodiversity loss]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/national-nutrient-strategy |title=National Nutrient Strategy |publisher=EPA|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report, the agency's Science Advisory Board succinctly stated: “Excess [[reactive nitrogen]] compounds in the environment are associated with many large-scale environmental concerns, including eutrophication of surface waters, toxic algae blooms, hypoxia, acid rain, nitrogen saturation in forests, and global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA |title=Reactive Nitrogen in the United States: An Analysis of Inputs, Flows, Consequences, and Management Options, A Report of the Science Advisory Board EPA-SAB-11-013 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225CC780623852578F10059533D/$File/EPA-SAB-11-013-unsigned.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219045824/http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/67057225cc780623852578f10059533d/%24file/epa-sab-11-013-unsigned.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:Nutrient sources Gulf-Mex &amp; Chesbay - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Agriculture is the major source of nutrient pollution in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the [[Chesapeake Bay]], agriculture is a major source, along with urban areas and atmospheric deposition.]]

===Nitrogen===
Use of [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s, and agricultural [[animal production]], especially [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFO), have added large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galloway |first1=J.N. |last2=Dentener |first2=F.J. |display-authors=1 |date=September 2004 |title=Nitrogen Cycles: Past, Present, and Future |url= |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=153–226 |doi=10.1007/s10533-004-0370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphorus===
Phosphorus pollution is caused by excessive use of fertilizers and [[manure]], particularly when compounded by [[soil erosion]]. Phosphorus is also discharged by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants and some industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/phosphorus.html |title=Phosphorus and Water |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land uses===
The principal source(s) of nutrient pollution in an individual [[drainage basin|watershed]] depend on the prevailing [[land use]]s. The sources may be [[Point source pollution|point sources]], [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]], or both:
* [[Agricultural pollution|Agriculture]]: animal production or crops
* Urban/suburban: [[Urban runoff|stormwater runoff]] from roads and parking lots; excessive fertilzer use on lawns; municipal sewage treatment plants; motor vehicle emissions
* Industrial: [[air pollution]] emissions (e.g. [[Thermal power station|electric power plants]]), wastewater discharges from various industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nutrient pollution from some air pollution sources may occur independently of the local land uses, due to long-range transport of air pollutants from distant sources.&lt;ref name="EPA envir effects"/&gt;

==Mitigation of nutrient pollutant discharges==
===United States===
Agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the largest source of water quality impairments throughout the U.S., based on surveys by state environmental agencies.&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2016 |title=National Nonpoint Source Program: A catalyst for water quality improvements |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-reports-and-project-summaries |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-16-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} NPS pollution is not subject to discharge permits under the federal [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-07-25 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA and states have used grants, partnerships and demonstration projects to create incentives for farmers to adjust their practices and reduce [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"/&gt;{{rp|10-11}}

====Discharge permits====
Many [[point source pollution|point source]] dischargers in the U.S., while not necessarily the largest sources of nutrients in their respective watersheds, are required to comply with nutrient [[effluent limitation]]s in their permits, which are issued through the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES), pursuant to the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/status-nutrient-requirements-npdes-permitted-facilities |title=Status of Nutrient Requirements for NPDES-Permitted Facilities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-08 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, such as the [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Washington, D.C. have installed [[biological nutrient removal]] (BNR) systems to comply with regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/nitrogen-reduction |title=Removing Nitrogen from Wastewater Protects our Waterways |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |access-date=2018-01-15 |publisher=DC Water |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other municipalities have made adjustments to the operational practices of their existing [[secondary treatment]] systems to control nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/national-study-nutrient-removal-and-secondary-technologies |title=National Study of Nutrient Removal and Secondary Technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-01-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharges from large livestock facilities (CAFO) are also regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface runoff from farm fields, the principal source of nutrients in many watersheds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/agriculture |title=Agriculture |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Learn the Issues |publisher=Chesapeake Bay Program |location=Annapolis, Maryland |access-date=2018-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is classified as NPS pollution and is not regulated by NPDES permits.&lt;ref name="NPDES basic"/&gt;

====TMDL program====
A [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] (TMDL) is a regulatory plan that prescribes the maximum amount of a pollutant (including nutrients) that a body of water can receive while still meeting CWA water quality standards.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Overview of Identifying and Restoring Impaired Waters under Section 303(d) of the CWA |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Section 303 of the Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a "pollutant budget" with allocations to each of the pollutant's sources.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDLs) at Work: New York: Restoring the Long Island Sound While Saving Money |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/tmdl/long_island_sound.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed ''nutrient over-enrichment.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Golen |first=Richard F. |title=Incorporating Shellfish Bed Restoration into a Nitrogen TMDL Implementation Plan |date=2007 |url=http://www.coonamessettfarm.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Incorporating_Shellfish_Bed_Restoration_into_Nitrogen_TMDL_Implementation_Plan.pdf |publisher=University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth |location=Dartmouth, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TMDL can prescribe the minimum level of [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) available in a body of water, which is directly related to nutrient levels. (''See'' [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia and Eutrophication|Aquatic Hypoxia]].) In 2010, 18 percent of TMDLs nationwide were related to nutrient levels including organic enrichment/oxygen depletion, noxious plants, algal growth, and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Water Quality Standards Academy|url=http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/standardsacademy/upload/module_nutrient.pdf|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into their NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |chapter=Chapter 6. Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations |date=September 2010 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-K-10-001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS discharges are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.&lt;ref name="TMDL overview"/&gt;

In [[Long Island Sound]], the TMDL development process enabled the [[Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection]] and the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to incorporate a 58.5 percent nitrogen reduction target into a regulatory and legal framework.&lt;ref name="water.epa.gov"/&gt;

==Nutrient remediation==
[[File:Mussels at Strawberry Rocks PC013145.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Mussels are examples of organisms that act as nutrient bioextractors&lt;/center&gt;]]Innovative solutions have been conceived to deal with nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nutrient remediation is a form of environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In [[environmental remediation]] nutrient removal technologies include [[biofiltration]], which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, [[riparian]] areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Biofiltration utilizes [[Assimilation (biology)#Examples of biological assimilation|biological assimilation]] to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is [[bioremediation]], which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, a strategy called biostimulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Nutrient bioextraction is bioremediation involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is the practice of farming and harvesting [[shellfish]] and [[seaweed]] for the purpose of removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutrient Bioextraction Overview |url=http://longislandsoundstudy.net/issues-actions/water-quality/nutrient-bioextraction-overview/ |publisher=Long Island Sound Study partnership |location=Stamford, CT |access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kroeger |first=Timm |title=Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that [[oysters]] and [[mussels]] have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Comparative Roles of Suspension Feeders in Ecosystems, Vol. 47|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|pages=93–120|author=Newell, R.I.E., Fisher, T.R., Holyoke, R.R., Cornwell, J.C.|edition=NATO Science Series IV: Earth and Environmental Sciences|contribution=Influence of eastern oysters on nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration in Chesapeake Bay, USA|editor=Dame, R., Olenin, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabowski,J.H., Petersen, C.H.|title=Restoring oyster reefs to recover ecosystem services|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier-Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|pages=281–298|edition=Ecosystem Engineers: Concepts, Theory and Applications|editor=Cuddington, K., Byers, J.E., Wilson, W.G., Hastings, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Rose JM, Tedesco M, Wikfors GH, Yarish C |title=International Workshop on Bioextractive Technologies for Nutrient Remediation Summary Report|url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nefsc/publications/|publisher=US Dept Commerce, Northeast Fish Sci Cent Ref Doc. 10-19; 12 p.

==History of nutrient policy in the United States==
The basic requirements for states to develop nutrient [[Clean Water Act#Water quality criteria|criteria]] and [[Clean Water Act#Water quality standards|standards]] were mandated in the 1972 Clean Water Act. Implementing this water quality program has been a major scientific, technical and resource-intensive challenge for both EPA and the states, and development is continuing well into the 21st century.

EPA published a wastewater management regulation in 1978 to begin to address the national nitrogen pollution problem, which had been increasing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilian |first1=Chris |title=Cracking down on Nutrient Pollution: CLF Fights to Bring New England's Coastal Waters Back to Life |journal=Conservation Matters |date=2010 |volume=16 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the agency published a ''National Nutrient Strategy'' with a focus on developing nutrient criteria.&lt;ref name="EPA-strategy"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1998 |title=National Strategy for the Development of Regional Nutrient Criteria |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20003NOU.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 822-R-98-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010 EPA published federal-level nutrient criteria for rivers/streams, lakes/reservoirs, estuaries and wetlands; and related guidance. "Ecoregional" nutrient criteria for 14 ecoregions across the U.S. were included in these publications. While states may directly adopt the EPA-published criteria, in many cases the states need to modfiy the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions. In 2004, EPA stated its expectations for numeric criteria (as opposed to less-specific narrative criteria) for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), [[chlorophyll a]](chl-a), and clarity, and established "mutually-agreed upon plans" for state criteria development. In 2007, the agency stated that progress among the states on developing nutrient criteria had been uneven. EPA reiterated its expectations for numeric criteria and promised its support for state efforts to develop their own criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/nutrient-memo-may252007.pdf |title=Nutrient Pollution and Numeric Water Quality Standards |author-last=Grumbles |author-first=Benjamin |date=2007-05-25 |publisher=EPA |id=Memorandum to State and Tribal Water Program Directors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 EPA published a progress report on state efforts to develop nutrient standards. A majority of states had not developed numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams; lakes and reservoirs; wetlands and estuaries (for those states that have estuaries).&lt;ref name="EPA-state adoption"&gt;{{cite report |title=State Adoption of Numeric Nutrient Standards (1998–2008) |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002TQ0.txt |date=December 2008 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 821-F-08-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, EPA also established a Nutrient Innovations Task Group (NITG), composed of state and EPA experts, to monitor and evaluate the progress of reducing nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="EPA_programmatic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/programmatic-information-numeric-nutrient-water-quality-criteria |title=Programmatic Information on Numeric Nutrient Water Quality Criteria |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the NTIG issued a report, "An Urgent Call to Action," expesssing concern that water quality continued to deteriorate nationwide due to increasing nutrient pollution, and recommending more vigorous development of nutrient standards by the states.&lt;ref name="NTIG"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2009 |title=An Urgent Call to Action: Report of the State-EPA Nutrient Innovations Task Group |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100U1TD.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 800-R-09-032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 EPA reiterated the need for states to fully develop their nutrient standards, noting that [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Monitoring, compliance and enforcement|drinking water violations]] for nitrates had doubled in eight years, that half of all streams nationwide had medium to high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, and [[harmful algal bloom]]s were increasing. The agency set out a framework for states to develop priorities and watershed-level goals for reductions of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/memo_nitrogen_framework.pdf |title=Working in Partnership with States to Address Phosphorus and Nitrogen Pollution through Use of a Framework for State Nutrient Reductions |author-last=Stoner |author-first=Nancy K. |date=2011-03-16 |publisher=EPA |id=Headquarters Memorandum to EPA Regional Administrators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient trading==
After the EPA had introduced watershed-based [[NPDES]] permitting in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed-Based NPDES Permitting|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/basics/Watershed-Based-NPDES-Permitting.cfm|publisher=EPA|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs led to the development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a type of [[United States regulation of point source water pollution#Water quality trading|water quality trading]], a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based policy instrument]] used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Water Quality Trading Webcast Seminar |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading.cfm|publisher=EPA|date=December 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters, State of Watershed Payments 2012|url=http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/reports/sowp2012|publisher=Forest Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2013 Forest Trends report summarized water quality trading programs and found three main types of funders: beneficiaries of watershed protection, polluters compensating for their impacts and ‘public good payers’ that may not directly benefit, but fund the pollution reduction credits on behalf of a government or [[NGO]]. As of 2013, payments were overwhelmingly initiated by public good payers like governments and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Genevieve Bennett |author2=Nathaniel Carroll |author3=Katherine Hamilton |title=Charting New Waters State of Watershed Payments 2012Figure 4b: Watershed Investments by Payer Type, Globally, Excluding China|url=http://www.forest-trends.org/documents/files/doc_3308.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=QqnnVNmuHNGpyAT2wILoCA&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAB&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1eQccAysAnihOB89UutZMKp-K_g|publisher=Forest Trends Association|accessdate=20 February 2015|pages=98|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Nutrient source apportionment ==
Nutrient source apportionment is used to estimate the nutrient load from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. [[Agriculture]] is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries tend to be the dominant contributors of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607736796|title=Source apportionment of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the aquatic environment|date=2005|publisher=European Environment Agency|others=European Environment Agency.|isbn=9291677779|location=Copenhagen|oclc=607736796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[water quality]] is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=S.|last2=Taylor|first2=D.|last3=McElarney|first3=Y.R.|last4=Foy|first4=R.H.|last5=Jordan|first5=P.|title=An evaluation of catchment-scale phosphorus mitigation using load apportionment modelling|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969711001653|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=409|issue=11|pages=2211–2221|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grizzetti|first=B.|last2=Bouraoui|first2=F.|last3=Marsily|first3=G. de|last4=Bidoglio|first4=G.|title=A statistical method for source apportionment of riverine nitrogen loads|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=302–315|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.07.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or [[nonpoint source pollution]], emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Daly|first4=Donal|last5=Bruen|first5=Michael|date=2016|title=Nutrient load apportionment to support the identification of appropriate water framework directive measures|jstor=10.3318/bioe.2016.22|journal=Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|volume=116B|issue=3|pages=245–263|doi=10.3318/bioe.2016.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.V.|last2=Jordan|first2=C.|last3=Annett|first3=J.A.|title=A phosphorus budget for Northern Ireland: inputs to inland and coastal waters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=304|issue=1-4|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=Deakin|first2=Jenny|last3=Archbold|first3=Marie|last4=Gill|first4=Laurence|last5=Daly|first5=Donal|last6=Bruen|first6=Michael|title=Sources of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to Irish rivers and coastal waters: Estimates from a nutrient load apportionment framework|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=601-602|pages=326–339|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of Liberal Arts''' (CLA) is the second largest of the 11 colleges at [[Oregon State University]] and offers 23 undergraduate degrees, 12 master's degrees and five doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/academics|title=OSU, College of Liberal Arts, Academics|last1=University|first1=Oregon State|date=|website=oregonstate.edu|publisher=OSU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLA coursework is offered at the university's main campus in [[Corvallis, Oregon]] and at the [[OSU-Cascades]] campus in [[Bend, Oregon]]. Currently, the CLA employs 290 faculty members with an enrollment of just over 3,600 full-time undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University|first1=Oregon State|title=Oregon State Enrollmenent Fall Term 2015 |url=http://oregonstate.edu/admin/aa/ir/sites/default/files/enroll-fall-2015.pdf|website=OregonState.edu|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The most popular CLA majors include psychology, economics, sociology, digital communications arts, anthropology, liberal studies, political science, history and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oregon State University|first1=OSU|title=Oregon State University, Enrollment, Fall 2015|url=http://oregonstate.edu/admin/aa/ir/sites/default/files/enroll-fall-2015.pdf |website=oregonstate.edu |publisher=OSU |accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Oregon State University]] first offered studies in liberal arts in 1868. According to the CLA website, however, students showed greater interest sciences and technology through much of the early 1900s. The trend forced administrators to de-emphasize liberal arts as a major.

By World War II, courses in liberal arts grew in popularity and OSU President A.L. Strand created the first divisional majors in humanities and social sciences at the university in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=OSU|first1=Oregon State University|title=About|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/about|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|publisher=OSU|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university later added the [[School of Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]] in 1961 and continued to expand liberal arts studies throughout the 1960s. In 1973, the school became formalized as the College of Liberal Arts (CLA). Early departments included the Humanities, Social Sciences and the Fine and Performing Arts.

The first graduate degrees were offered by the college in scientific and technical communications in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Dictionary of University Histories|title=Oregon State University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tntEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=oregon+state+university+college+of+liberal+arts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hd0Il93oMc&amp;sig=mDyRKtYytHU9SHMWafwAtzrH41Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOtfWMxazLAhVO2mMKHfopCto4ZBDoAQgcMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=oregon%20state%20university%20college%20of%20liberal%20arts&amp;f=false|website=books.google.com/|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Pg 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pasture beech''' ({{lang-de|Weidbuche}}) is a particular species or growth habit of the [[fagus sylvatica|beech]] which developed in the [[Black Forest]], because the young trees growing on [[pasture]]s or in [[wood pasture|pastoral forests]] were nibbled by the grazing animals, above all cows and goats, i.e. their leaves and branches were eaten and, as a consequence, they have no main trunk and grow bushy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/36652 Weidbuchen im Schwarzwald und ihre Entstehung durch Verbiß des Wälderviehs] (Pasture beeches in the Black Forest and their formation due to nibbling animals grazing in the pastoral forests), {{ISBN|3-88251-121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In structural engineering, the '''plastic moment''' (Mp) is a property of a structural section. It is defined as the moment at which the entire cross section has reached its yield stress. This is theoretically the maximum bending moment that the section can resist - when this point is reached a [[plastic hinge]] is formed and any load beyond this point will result in theoretically infinite plastic deformation. In practice most materials are work-hardened resulting in increased stiffness and moment resistance until the material fails. This is of little significance in [[structural mechanics]] as the deflection prior to this occurring is considered to be an earlier failure point in the member.

Mp for a rectangular section can be calculated with the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;M_p= (bd^2 / 4 )\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt;

For other sections it is normal to calculate &lt;math&gt;Z_P&lt;/math&gt; then substitute it into the formula as follows:
&lt;math&gt;M_p=\sigma Z_p&lt;/math&gt;

The plastic moment for a given section will always be larger than the yield moment (the bending moment at which the first part of the sections reaches the yield stress)

In [[astronomy]], a '''redshift survey''' is a [[astronomical surveys|survey]] of a section of the sky to measure the [[redshift]] of [[astronomical object]]s: usually galaxies, but sometimes other objects such as galaxy clusters or quasars.  
Using [[Hubble's law]], the redshift can be used to estimate the distance of an object from [[Earth]].  By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky.  These observations are used to measure detailed statistical properties of the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the universe. In conjunction with observations of early structure in the [[cosmic microwave background]], these results can place strong constraints on cosmological parameters such as the average matter density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=John A.|last2=Cole|first2=Shaun|last3=Norberg|first3=Peder|last4=Baugh|first4=Carlton M.|last5=Bland-Hawthorn|first5=Joss|last6=Bridges|first6=Terry|last7=Cannon|first7=Russell D.|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|last10=Couch|first10=Warrick|last11=Dalton|first11=Gavin|last12=Deeley|first12=Kathryn

Generally the construction of a redshift survey involves two phases: first the selected area of the sky is imaged with a wide-field telescope, then galaxies brighter than a defined limit are selected from the resulting images as non-pointlike objects; optionally, colour selection may also be used to assist discrimination between stars and galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SkyServer - Algorithms|url=http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en/help/docs/algorithm.asp?key=target|website=sdss.org|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the selected galaxies are observed by [[spectroscopy]], most commonly at visible wavelengths, to measure the wavelengths of prominent [[spectral line]]s; comparing observed and laboratory wavelengths then gives the [[redshift]] for each galaxy.

The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast conglomeration of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.

The first systematic redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]] of around 2,200 galaxies, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. This was later extended to the CfA2 redshift survey of 15,000 galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falco|first1=Emilio E.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Michael J.|last3=Geller|first3=Margaret J.|last4=Huchra|first4=John P.|last5=Peters|first5=James|last6=Berlind|first6=Perry|last7=Mink|first7=Douglas J.|last8=Tokarz|first8=Susan P.|last9=Elwell|first9=Barbara|title=The Updated Zwicky Catalog (UZC)|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=111|issue=758|pages=438–452|doi=10.1086/316343|year=1999|arxiv = astro-ph/9904265 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..438F }}&lt;/ref&gt; completed in the early 1990s.

These early redshift surveys were limited in size by taking a spectrum for one galaxy at a time; from the 1990s, the development of fibre-optic spectrographs and multi-slit spectrographs enabled spectra for several hundred galaxies to be observed simultaneously, and much larger redshift surveys became feasible. Notable examples are the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] (221,000 redshifts, completed 2002); the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (approximately 1 million redshifts by 2007) and the [[Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey]].  At high redshift the largest current surveys are the [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey]] and the [[VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS)]]; these have around 50,000 redshifts each, and are mainly focused on galaxy evolution. 

[[ZFOURGE]] or the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey is a large and deep medium-band imaging survey which aims to establish an observational benchmark of [[galaxy]] properties at [[redshift]] z &gt; 1. The survey is using [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]] FOURSTAR instrument on the [[Magellan Telescopes]], surveying in all three HST legacy fields: COSMOS, CDFS, and UDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://zfourge.tamu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the demands on observing time required to obtain spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., redshifts determined directly from [[Spectral line|spectral features]] measured at high precision), a common alternative is to use [[photometric redshift]]s based on model fits to the brightnesses and colors of objects. Such "photo-z's" can be used in large surveys to estimate the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars, provided the [[Galaxy#Types and morphology|galaxy types]] and [[Galaxy color-magnitude diagram|colors]] are well understood in a particular redshift range. At present, the errors on photometric redshift measurements are significantly higher than those of [[Spectroscopic astronomy|spectroscopic]] redshifts, but future surveys (for example, the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]]) aim to significantly refine the technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3950">[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Generally sessile ''Hydra'' attached to a substrate]]
In [[biology]], '''sessility''' (in the sense of positional movement or ''[[motility]]'') refers to [[organisms]] that do not possess a means of self-locomotion and are normally immobile. This is distinct from the [[sessility (botany)|second meaning of sessility]] which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move through outside sources (such as water currents) but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow.  Other organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a manmade object such as a buoy or ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|ISBN=9781497006515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]].  Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, “suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;WP. Ecology. 1979. Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio170/Readings/sousa%201979.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clumping==
{{Main Article|Clumping (biology)}}
[[File:Blue mussel clump.jpg|thumb|280px|Blue mussels, ''[[Mytilus edulis]]'', are sessile and exhibit clumping.]]
'''Clumping''' is a behavior in sessile organisms, in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H. Thorp|author2=Alan P. Covich |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=213|date=2001|isbn=0-12-690647-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&amp;dq=Sessile+Limnology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The circa [[littoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Distinction from anatomical and botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. See [[Peduncle (anatomy)]], [[Peduncle (botany)]] and [[Sessility (botany)]]. A sessile structure has no stalk.

'''Sociology of language''' is the study of the relations between [[language]] and [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman |first=Joshua A. |year=1972 |title=The sociology of language: An interdisciplinary social science approach to language in society |publisher=Newbury House |isbn=978-0-912066-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the field of [[sociolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mesthrie |first=Rajend |year=2007 |chapter=Sociolinguistics and sociology of language |editor1=Bernard Spolsky |editor2=Francis M. Hult |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |isbn=9781405154109 |doi= 10.1111/b.9781405154109.2007.00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the effect of society on language. One of its longest and most prolific proponents was [[Joshua Fishman]], who among other major contributions, was founding editor of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]''. Sociology of language studies society in relation to language whereas Sociolinguistics studies language in relation to society. For the former, society is the object of study, whereas, for the latter, language is the object of study. The basic idea is that language reflects, among several other things, attitudes that speakers want to exchange or that just get reflected through language use. These attitudes of the speakers is the sociologist's information.

A sociology of language would seek to understand the way that social dynamics are affected by individual and group language use. According to Su-Chiao Chen language is considered to be a social value within this field, which researches social groups for phenomena like [[multilingualism]] and Lingual conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Su-Chiao|editor=Nancy Hornberger and David Corson|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education: Research Methods in Language and Education|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-011-4535-0|pages=1–14|chapter=Sociology of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have to do with who is 'authorized' to use what language, with whom and under what conditions. It would have to do with how an individual or group identity is established by the language that they have available for them to use. It would seek to understand individual expression, one's (libidinal) investment in the linguistic tools that one has access to in order to bring oneself to other people.

== History and origins ==
Sociology of language, particularly American sociolinguistics, was regarded to have been founded in the early 1960s, mainly by [[William Labov]], who developed much of the methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shuy|first=Roger W. |title=A Brief History of American Sociolinguistics 1949-1989 |journal=Historiographia Linguistica |volume=17 |issue=1-2 |year=1990|pages=183-209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">A '''software map''' represents static, dynamic, and evolutionary information of [[software system]]s and their [[software development process]]es by means of 2D or 3D map-oriented [[information visualization]]. It constitutes a fundamental concept and tool in [[software visualization]], [[software analytics]], and [[software diagnosis]]. Its primary applications include risk analysis for and monitoring of [[code quality]], team activity, or software development progress &lt;ref&gt;Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps Johannes Bohnet and Döllner, Jürgen. In: Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and, generally, improving effectiveness of software engineering with respect to all related artifacts, processes, and stakeholders throughout the [[software engineering]] process and [[software maintenance]].

== Motivation and concepts ==
Software maps are applied in the context of [[software engineering]]: Complex, long-term [[software development]] projects are commonly faced by manifold difficulties such as the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of [[code quality]] and [[software quality]] to ensure [[software maintenance]] of the system in the future. 
In particular, "Maintaining complex software systems tends to be costly because developers spend a significant part of their time with trying to understand the system’s structure and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet: ''Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance''. PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea of software maps is to cope with that challenge and optimization problems by providing effective communication means to close the communication gap among the various stakeholders and information domains within software development projects and obtaining insights in the sense of [[information visualization]].

Software maps take advantage of well-defined cartographic [[map]] techniques using the virtual [[3D city models|3D city model]] metaphor&lt;ref&gt;R. Wettel, M. Lanza: ''Visualizing Software Systems as Cities''. 4th IEEE international Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to express the underlying complex, abstract information space. The metaphor is required "since software has no physical shape, there is no natural mapping of software to a two-dimensional space".&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuhn , P. Loretan , O. Nierstrasz: ''Consistent Layout for Thematic Software Maps'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Software maps are non-spatial [[map]]s that have to convert the hierarchy data and its attributes into a spatial representation.

== Applications ==
Software maps generally allow for comprehensible and effective communication of course, risks, and costs of software development projects to various stakeholders such as management and development teams. 
They communicate the status of applications and systems currently being developed or further developed to project leaders and management at a glance. "A key aspect for this decision making is that software maps provide the structural context required for correct interpretation of these performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;''D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an instrument of communication, software maps act as open, transparent information spaces which enable priorities of code quality and the creation of new functions to be balanced against one another and to decide upon and implement necessary measures to improve the [[software development process]].

For example, they facilitate decisions as to where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems.

Due to their high degree of expressiveness (e.g., information density) and their instantaneous, automated generation, the maps additionally serve to reflect the current status of system and development processes, bridging an essential information gap between management and development teams, improve awareness about the status, and serve as early risk detection instrument.

== Contents ==
Software maps are based on objective information as determined by the [[KPI driven code analysis]] as well as by imported information from [[software repository]] systems, information from the [[source code]]s, or [[software development tool]]s and [[programming tool]]s. In particular, software maps are not bound to a specific [[programming language]], [[modeling language]], or [[software development process]] model.

Software maps use the hierarchy of the software implementation artifacts such as [[source code]] files as base to build a [[tree mapping]], i.e., a rectangular area that represents the whole hierarchy, subdividing the area into rectangular sub-areas. A software map, informally speaking, looks similar to a virtual [[3D city model]], whereby artifacts of the software system appear as virtual, rectangular 3D buildings or towers, which are placed according to their position in the software implementation hierarchy.

Software maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics by mapping that information onto visual variables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Publications/Publications/Carpendale_visual_variables.pdf |title=Considering Visual Variables as a Basis for Information Visualization}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the tree map elements such as footprint size, height, color or texture. They can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates.

== Mapping software system example ==
Software maps "combine thematic information about software development processes (evolution), software quality, structure, and dynamics and display that information in a cartographic manner".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 
* The height of a virtual building can be proportional to the complexity of the code unit (e.g., single or combined [[software metric]]s).
* The ground area of a virtual 3D building can be proportional to the number of lines of code in the module or (e.g., non-comment lines-of-code NCLOC).
* The color can express the current development status, i.e., how many developers are changing/editing the code unit.

With this exemplary configuration, the software map shows crucial points in the source code with relations to aspects of the software development process. For example, it becomes obvious at a glance what to change in order to:
* implement changes quickly;
* evaluate quickly the impact of changes in one place on functionality elsewhere;
* reduce entanglements that lead to uncontrolled processes in the application;
* find errors faster;
* discover and eliminate bad programming style.

Software maps represent key tools in the scope of automated software diagnosis [http://www.softwarediagnostics.com software diagnostics].

== As business intelligence tools and recommendation systems ==
Software maps can be used, in particular, as analysis and presentation tool of [[business intelligence]] systems, specialized in the analysis of software related data. Furthermore, software maps "serve as recommendation systems for software engineering".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software maps are not limited by software-related information: They can include any hierarchical system information as well, for example, maintenance information about complex technical artifacts.

== Visualization techniques ==
Software maps are investigated in the domain of [[software visualization]]. The visualization of software maps is commonly based on [[tree mapping]], "a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures"&lt;ref&gt;B. Johnson, B. Sneiderman: ''Tree-maps: a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures''. Proc. of IEEE VIS, 284–291, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; or other hierarchy mapping approaches.

=== Layout algorithms ===
To construct software maps, different layout approaches are used to generate the basic spatial mapping of components such as: 
* Tree-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy into a recursively nested rectangular area.
* Voronoi-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy by generating a [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] map.

=== Layout stability ===
The spatial arrangement computed by layouts such as defined by tree maps strictly depends on the hierarchy. If software maps have to be generated frequently for an evolving or changing system, the usability of software maps is affected by non-stable layouts, that is, minor changes to the hierarchy may cause significant changes to the layout.

In contrast to regular Voronoi treemap algorithms, which do not provide deterministic layouts, layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps can be extended to provides a high degree of layout similarity for varying hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Schmechel et al.: ''Visualization of Varying Hierarchies by Stable Layout of Voronoi Treemaps''. Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP 2014), SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, pp. 50-58, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches exist for the tree-map based case.

== History ==
Software maps methods and techniques belong the scientific displine of [[Software visualization]] and [[information visualization]]. They form a key concept and technique within the fields of [[software diagnosis]]. They have applications also in [[software mining]] and [[software analytics]]. Software maps have been extensively developed and researched by, e.g., at the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] for IT systems engineering, in particular for large-scale, complex IT systems and applications.

A '''steam rupture''' occurs within a pressurized system of super critical water when the pressure exceeds the design plus [[safety margin]] specification.  A steam rupture can occur in any elevated temperature pressurized system, including, but not limited to:  Automobile cooling systems, stationary power plants, mobile power plants, steam driven tools (such as some [[trip hammer]]s), and even the delivery systems for application processes such as cleaning and fabric fullering.

[[Image:Apoplast and symplast pathways.svg|thumb|300px|The apoplastic and symplastic pathways]]
The '''symplast''' of a [[plant]] is the inner side of the [[plasma membrane]] in which water and low-molecular-weight [[Solution|solutes]] can freely [[diffusion|diffuse]]. Symplast cells have more than one nucleus. 

The [[plasmodesmata]] allow the direct flow of small molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and ions between cells. Larger molecules, including [[transcription factor]]s and [[plant virus]]es, can also be transported through with the help of [[actin]] structures.

This allows direct [[cytoplasm]]-to-cytoplasm flow of water and other nutrients along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow is used in the root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. It moves these solutes from [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] cells through the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] into the [[endodermis]]. Once solutes reach the endodermal cells thorough [[Apoplast|apoplastic flow]], they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the [[Casparian strip]]. Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the [[pericycle]], where it can be moved into the [[xylem]] for long distance transport.
It is contrasted with the apoplastic flow, which uses cell wall transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|year=2014|isbn=9780321743671|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The symplastic transport was first realized by Eduard Tangl in 1879, who also discovered the [[plasmodesmata]], a term coined by [[Eduard Strasburger]], 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, E. (1879). Ueber offene Communicationen zwischen den Zellen des Endosperms einiger Samen. ''Jahrbüecherfüer Wissenschaftliche Botanik'' 12: 170–190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, E. (1901). Über plasmaverbindungen pflanzlicher zellen. ''Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik'' 36: 493–610.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[Johannes von Hanstein|Hanstein]] coined the term symplast.&lt;ref&gt;Hanstein, J. 1880. ''[https://archive.org/details/DasProtoplasma Das Protoplasma]''. Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; The contrasting terms apoplast and symplast were used together in 1930 by [[Ernst Münch|Münch]].&lt;ref&gt;Münch, E (1930). ''Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze''. Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, W. F. (2003). The role of cytoplasmic streaming in symplastic transport.

A '''thermal blanket''' is a device used in thermal desorption to clean soil contamination. The primary function of a thermal blanket is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325&amp;nbsp;°C and as high as 900 °C&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contaminants in the Subsurface: Source Zone Assessment and Remediation|last=National Research council|first=|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2004|isbn=0309546648|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so that they break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with volatilized contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants. Aside from evaporation and volatilization, the contaminants may also be removed from the soil through other mechanisms such as [[steam distillation]], [[pyrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], and other [[Chemical reaction|chemical reactions]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wiley's Remediation Technologies Handbook: Major Contaminant Chemicals and Chemical Groups|last=Lehr|first=Jay|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0471455998 |doi=10.1002/0471655473 |location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=1042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their placement, the thermal blanket can only be used in shallow areas, which is around 1 meter. The process can take more than 24 hours to treat 6 inches of soil and up to 4 days for contaminated areas with depths of 12 to 18 inches.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analysis of selected enhancements for soil vapor extraction|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|first=|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1997|isbn=9781428903609|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=7-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep contamination (contamination at depths greater than 1 meter) is handled using a similar method but with a deep penetrating heat source.  This is commonly referred to as an [[in situ thermal desorption]] (ISTD) thermal well and it uses heater elements that consist of nichrome wires in a ceramic insulator. Like the thermal blankets, the heating temperature could reach as high as 900 °C, heating adjacent regions through heat conduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vacuum is also applied to withdraw broken contaminants.

==Concerns==
It is reported that the application of the thermal blanket is limited&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and this could be attributed to a number of concerns. For example, as a contaminant becomes heated, it may leak outside of the area of the thermal blanket.  Therefore, the blanket must completely cover the contaminated area and have a strong enough vacuum to prohibit the spread of contamination. Incomplete destruction of contaminants may also lead to the introduction of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[furans]] into the air.

The thermal blanket method has not been effectively tested on organic contaminants. The technology is presently commercially available. [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Technology Ventures, Inc., for instance, has developed its own ISTD thermal blanket solution that can treat or remove contaminants on near-surface soil or pavements without excavation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Xenology''' is the scientific study of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Derived from the Greek ''xenos'', which as a substantive has the meaning "stranger, wanderer, refugee" and as an adjective "foreign, alien, strange, unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', new (ninth) edition, with a supplement, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== In science fiction ===
It is used to denote a hypothetical science whose object of study would be extraterrestrial societies developed by alien lifeforms. In science fiction criticism and studies the term has been advocated by writers such as [[David Brin]] ("Xenology: The New Science of Asking 'Who's Out There?'" ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', 26 April 1983)&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Stableford, ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2006, p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt; as an analogue of (terrestrial) [[ethnology]]. By extension the term may also refer to the fictional creation of "alternative humankinds".&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances in which Xenology was referred to in a work of Science Fiction include the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky| Brothers Strugatsky's]] 1972 novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]''. In section three of which one of the character's, a noble laureate by the name of Valentine Pillman, explains Xenology as "an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human."&lt;ref name="StrugatskyStrugatsky2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arkady Strugatsky|author2=Boris Strugatsky|title=Roadside Picnic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-365-40085-8|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cultural studies ===
The term xenology was employed by German [[Indologist]] [[Wilhelm Halbfass]] in his ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'' (India and Europe: Perspectives on Their Spiritual Encounter) (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', Schwabe Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the study of the ethnocentric views held by societies with regard to different classes of foreigner, in other words the positive or negative ways in which a given culture defines those outside or alien to it.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Killingley, "Mlecchas, Yavanas and Heathens: Interacting Xenologies in Early Nineteenth-Century Calcutta," in ''Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its Impact on Indian and Cross-cultural Studies'', ed. Eli Franco, Karin Preisendanz, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenology is thus the study of the various modalities whereby self and otherness are defined "within a historically complex collision of cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey P. Alper, review of ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', in ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (April, 1983), pp. 189-196&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===
{{primary section|date=June 2017}}
[[Robert Freitas|Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] self-published a book on the subject, ''Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization'' (XRI, 1979). Freitas argued for the primacy of the term in the context of extraterrestrial life in a 1983 letter to the journal Nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Nature 301(13 January 1983):106 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5896/full/301106a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Correspondence to Nature Vol. 301(13), 13 January 1983, p 106. http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/NamingETL.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
