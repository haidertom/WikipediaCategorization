The '''acute to chronic ratio (ACR)''' uses [[Acute toxicity | acute toxicity data]] to gauge the [[chronic toxicity]] (MATC) of a chemical of interest to an organism. The science behind determining a [[Maximum acceptable toxicant concentration|safe concentration]] to the environment is imperfect, statistically limited, and resource intensive. There is an unfilled demand for the rapid assessment of different chemical [[toxicity]] to many different organisms. The ACR is a proposed solution to this demand.

While empirical methods are crucial to making scientific conclusions and informed decisions, best personal judgement is often the best tool to the regulator in allowing or prohibiting potentially toxic chemicals from entering the environment. This means taking into consideration information about [[chemical structure]], [[Quantitative structure activity relationship|physical]] and [[chemical properties]] including fate and transport in the environment, and most importantly toxicological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=May, M.|author2=Drost, W.|author3=Germer, S.|author4=Juffernholz, T.|author5=Hahn, S.|date=2016|title=Evaluation of acute-to-chronic ratios of fish and Daphnia to predict acceptable no-effect levels|journal=Environmental Sciences Europe|volume=28 |issue=1|page=16|url=http://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-016-0084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACR is mathematically the inverse of the application factor (AF), which was first proposed by Mount and Stephan (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mount, D. I.|author2= C. E. Stephan|title=A method for establishing acceptable toxicant limits for fish malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D|journal=Trans. Am. Fish. Soc.|volume=96|page=185|date=1967|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96%5B185:AMFEAT%5D2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides no new information, it simply converts AF values into whole integer numbers that are more easily comparable for researchers visually.

==Calculation==
The ACR is the inverse of the application factor (AF). This makes it easier for regulators to visualize data as whole numbers rather than decimals. The AF is calculated by dividing the [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) by the Lethal Concentration that kills 50% of test organisms in an acute toxicity test ([[LC50]]).

&lt;math&gt; MATC = \sqrt{(NOEC)(LOEC)} &lt;/math&gt;

The Maximum Allowable Toxicity Concentration (MATC is determined by taking the square root of the No Effects Concentration ([[No-observed-adverse-effect level|NOEC]]) multiplied by the Low effect concentration ([[Chronic toxicity#NOEC.2FLOEC|LOEC]]).

&lt;math&gt; AF = MATC/LC50&lt;/math&gt;

The Application Factor (AF) is determined by dividing the MATC by the LC50

&lt;math&gt; ACR = 1/AF &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; LC50/MATC &lt;/math&gt;

The ACR is then the inverse of the AF.

==Regulatory use==
There are thousands of new and different chemicals that are designed and synthesized by private chemical manufacturers every year. The public demands that all of these chemicals go through testing and be approved for use by the [[EPA]] under the [[TSCA]]. Part of that testing requirement is determining the toxicity of chemicals to organisms in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/reviewing-new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/regulatory-actions-under-tsca|title=Actions under TSCA Section 5 - US EPA|website=Epa.gov|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law=== 
Section 5 of the TSCA states that the EPA must respond to pre-manufacturing notices (PMN) 90 –180 days after submission by the manufacturer. The EPA is responsible for identifying the substance, its proposed use, amount made, byproducts, exposure levels, and all existing environmental and health data necessary to prevent significant harm to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kenaga, E. E.|date=1982|title=Predictability of chronic toxicity from acute toxicity of chemicals in fish and aquatic invertebrates|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|volume=1 |issue=4|pages=347–358|url=http://doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620010410}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally there are no PMN test requirements so there is often a minimal amount of data presented. This may be discussed as a fault of the TSCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-292T|title=Chemical Regulation: Observations on Improving the Toxic Substances Control Act|first=U.S. Government Accountability|last=Office|date=2 December 2009|website=Gao.gov|issue=GAO-10-292T|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New chemical PMNs are submitted early in the chemical’s development so they rarely contain information about chronic toxicity - yet the EPA must respond within the 90-180 day time period after submission of the PMN.
This essentially puts a huge burden on the EPA because chemical effects to the environment are extremely hard to predict simply based on single species toxicity tests (SST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Maltby, L., Clayton, S. A., Yu, H., McLoughlin, N., Wood, R. M. and Yin, D. |date=2000|title= Using single-species toxicity tests, community-level responses, and toxicity identification evaluations to investigate effluent impacts|journal= Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=19 |pages=151–157|doi=10.1002/etc.5620190118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited time period that the TSCA gives the EPA for making this decision requires the EPA to make decisions with a high amount of uncertainty. This ultimately makes the goal of protecting the environment from significant adverse effects difficult.

The results of acute and chronic toxicity testing form the basis of knowledge that regulators draw from in performing work related to ecological risk assessment and designing policy that defines how much of a chemical of interest should be allowed in certain environments. While this sounds simple enough to the layperson, it is extremely difficult in practice due to a large number of modifying factors inextricably tied to toxicity tests and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmetrics.net.au/docs/Fox_Keynote+Address.pdf|title=ENVIRONMETRICS AUSTRALIA|website=Environmetrics.net.au|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different toxic effects can be observed from the same chemical through different types of environmental exposures and parameters, and thus toxicity results from [[Acute toxicity|acute]] and [[Chronic toxicity|chronic]] tests must be jointly considered in decision making. Additionally, chronic toxicity tests tend to require significantly more attention and resources than acute tests which makes them much less feasible for basing decisions off of in a timely manner. The need for development of more advanced statistical methods, and uniformity in using these methods by regulators has been made apparent in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Fox, D. R. and Landis, W. G. |date=2016 |title=Don't be fooled—A no-observed-effect concentration is no substitute for a poor concentration–response experiment |journal=Environ Toxicol Chem |volume=35 |pages=2141–2148 |doi=10.1002/etc.3459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific methods for determining acute and chronic toxicity to organisms are inherently imperfect and non-uniform throughout the field of research, and the most useful tool for decision making by officials is more often than not  best personal judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/risk/about-risk-assessment|title=About Risk Assessment - US EPA|website=Epa.gov|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular new method for ecological risk assessment is the [https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/30003PBG.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1995+Thru+1999&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C95thru99%5CTxt%5C00000013%5C30003PBG.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL acute to chronic estimation (ACE)]. This method uses computer software to estimate chronic toxicity, which provides similar information with much less effort and expense to the researcher.

==Limitations==
The ACR is derived from data generated by SSTs, as so falls victim to the same errors and limitations. These limitations are described in detail in literature &lt;ref&gt;Cairns, J. Environ Monit Assess (1984) 4: 259. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24257782 doi:10.1007/BF00394145]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using point estimates such as NOECs/LOECs reduces a data set containing many values down to an isometric, removing the rich visual information that allows the researcher to assess the reliability and variability in the data. Information such as the slope of the dose-response curve, from which NOECs are LOECs are derived, is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Landis, W. G. and Chapman, P. M. |date=2011|title= Well past time to stop using NOELs and LOELs. |journal=Integr Environ Assess Manag|volume= 7|pages= vi–viii. |doi=10.1002/ieam.249}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, without NOECs and LOECs regulatory decisions are much harder to make. While ACR has drawbacks due to the uncertainty of the point estimates it uses to define it, it is still widely valued as a regulatory tool in making environmental assessments and policy decisions.

ACRs are based off tests with a number of different methodologies, which means that there can be significant variance among ACRs.

'''Aesthetic Realism''' is a philosophy founded by poet and critic [[Eli Siegel]] (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves."

The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in [[SoHo]], [[New York City]], through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.

The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that "we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;ref&gt;Statement of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, 1990: "It is a fact that men and women have changed from homosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. Meanwhile, as is well known, there is now intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is by no means central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 the Foundation discontinued its public presentation of the fact that through Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to change from homosexuality are not being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Bready, "Eli Siegel's system lives" in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', 28 July 1982: "In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "In Aesthetic Realism, beauty is the putting together of things that can be thought of as opposites….Aesthetic Realism says that reality is aesthetics….Reality is, when completely seen, beautiful: that is, reality consists of a mingling in aesthetic relation, of such opposites as the orderly and disorderly…." ''Aesthetic Realism: Three Instances''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siegel’s critical theory, "the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art." A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors'': "This philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that ‘what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life…, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.’" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|William Packard]]: "And as far as Aesthetic Realism goes, it is eminent good sense. Eli Siegel has boiled it down to a simple formula: ‘In reality, opposites are one; art shows this.’ An artist will try to see the opposites in action, in himself and in his world and eventually in his own work." "How a Major Poet Is Ostracized by Lit Cliches: Eli Siegel in View," published in ''newsArt The Smith,'' (1978) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/NewsArt-Packard-article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley: "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one. Art shows this.’" "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'', July 1964, (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell in ''Art Students League News'': "According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world." (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Philosophers have often seen reality as freedom and order, simultaneously and continually. Indeed, the first opposites I chose in my ''Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?'', 1955, were Freedom and Order. You can see these right now in the world if you look at it: freedom and order are in the street, in the ocean, in woods in upper New York State." "Good Sense for the World," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #221 (22 June 1977); URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro221.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Verlaine...has some of the subtlest music in French verse. And here we have the first description of the world which beauty and art illustrate: that is, the world is simple and various at once. It is one universe, even as it has many twigs in twilight." "Good Sense for the World" (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel reasoned, "If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "If…the structure of the world corresponds to the structure music may have or a novel may have [or any art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked. "Good Sense for the World," (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is "every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Shepp: "Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education." (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples &amp; H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.) URL: http://www.marthashepp.com/cv_syll_phil/CritPresent4Website.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Poetics, URL: http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510041505/http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html |date=2010-05-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Aesthetic Realism: a Tripartite Study," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #247 (21 December 1977) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro247.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Aesthetic Realism describe[s] the two opposed purposes in everyone’s life. As Siegel once observed, even though 'every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable,' there is also 'a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.' According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity) and, on a larger scale, to the entire world when one nation’s contempt for another leads to war." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—"the addition to self through the lessening of something else"—he or she is unjust to people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Patterson: "Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves." ''Herald Sun'' of Melbourne, Australia (19 April 2009); URL: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/better-to-try-world-on-love/story-e6frf92o-1225700167216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity)." ''Contemporary Authors''; URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell: "Among many bold pronouncements none by Siegel are stronger than the assertion that contempt of the world produces insanity." ''Art Students League News'' (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kernan]] in ''The Washington Post'' (16 August 1978): "There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls ‘the world.’ These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. ‘Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,’ he says. Contempt can lead to insanity, according to Siegel." URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Wash-Post-Article-Kernan.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "An attitude to the world…governs one in one's everyday life. If you feel that the world is ill-managed, is contemptible, is unkind, you have to show that in how you see Mildred or how you see Morton…" "Aesthetic Realism; or, Is a Person an Aesthetic Situation?" (14 January 1969); URL: http://www.annefielding.net/Aesthetic-Situation-by-Eli-Siegel.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important.  Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff: "Nancy Starrels once attempted a working definition: Aesthetic Realism, she said, is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’" ''New York Post'' (16 June 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "As Siegel once observed,…‘every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable.’" ''Contemporary Authors''; URL:http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for "human beings placed differently from ourselves" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that "the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life." Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, "civilization has yet to begin."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Civilization Begins" in ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #228 (10 August 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.  The first, ''Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, '' was written from 1941-3.  Individual chapters, including "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" and "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0910492294}}&lt;/ref&gt; were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press).&lt;ref&gt;D.E., ''Booklist,'' (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): "A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect."&lt;/ref&gt; His second text, ''Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,'' completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''

==Poetry==

Siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Starrett in the ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): "It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'&lt;/ref&gt; the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded ''The Nation'''s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality ''is'' relation, "that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things," is in this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Boldt: ''Modern American Poetry,'' p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): "Siegel’s poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‘the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do-with other things.’"&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated "have a great deal to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors'': "Siegel composed ‘Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana’ with this principle in mind, taking 'many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing] in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.'"&lt;/ref&gt; These are lines near the end of the poem: &lt;br&gt;
::Hot afternoons are real; afternoons are; places, things, thoughts, feelings are; poetry is;
::The world is waiting to be known; Earth, what it has in it!  The past is in it;
::All words, feelings, movements, words, bodies, clothes, girls, trees, stones, things of beauty,
:::books, desires are in it; and all are to be known;
::Afternoons have to do with the whole world….

The search for that which connects all branches of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism on Art and Self," ''Peter Gorlin Interviews Eli Siegel on The World of Art, WKCR, 18 April 1963'' published in ''Definition 15'' (Definition Press, 1963): "Aesthetic Realism is an educational method. And the first thing that it asks is: What is there in common in biology, and in history, and in the study of music, and in psychology, and in religion, and in cookery, and in the study of the history of sport, and in the study of fabrics, and in the study of chemistry, and the study of geology, and in the study of the dance?  ''Is'' there something in common? The one thing that is in common is, obviously, the opposites, because in every art and every science, there is something that is and something that changes."&lt;/ref&gt; led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;''Music's Intellectual History,'' edited by Zravko Blažeković &amp; Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie (Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale, 2009), page 167: "It is a central belief of Aesthetic Realism that art, indeed, has metaphysical substance, and therefore any attempt to sever art and philosophy limits the precision and the freedom of one's mind. 'The world, art, and self,' said Eli Siegel, 'explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 24 September 1944: "These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer’s opinion, scholarly and valuable."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Villager,'' 26 July 1956: "This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel."&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that 'what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.'"&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, ''Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate an inaminate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel defined poetry as "the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel…[is the] founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism....Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, "emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Skene Catling, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 19 April 1952: "'In aesthetic realism,' Mr. Siegel said, 'emotion changes into logic: There is no rift between the two.' Emotion and logic, energy and calm, can and must coexist in poetry if it is to be good poetry, in Mr. Siegel’s opinion."&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel...founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism...[showed that] every true poem...has come from a person’s seeing something so justly that he or she has perceived in the immediate object the structure of the world itself: ''the oneness of opposites.'' And we ''hear'' that structure as poetic music. Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.' That is true about every instance of good poetry--no matter what its style, or language, or in what century it was written. On the other hand, an unauthentic poem, however impressive, however praised, is insufficiently sincere...lacks that honesty which is a self at its very center meeting what an object really is."&lt;/ref&gt; "Poetry," he wrote, "arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #181 (15 September 1976): "Poetry arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.

In thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including "Poetry and Anger," "Poetry and Love," "Educational Method Is Poetic," "Poetry and Time," "Poetry, Money, and Good Will," "A Poetic Technique of Parenthood," "Poetry and History," and "Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/lectures/&lt;/ref&gt; His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it "the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves."  This education, they assert, "makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, K. Van Outryve, Preface to ''The Critical Muse,'' p. iii (Terrain Gallery, 1973) {{ISBN|0-911492-18-6}}: "''The Critical Muse'' is an anthology permeated with the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism....Every poem on the pages that follow is about the need of a person to put together opposites in himself. What makes these poems so important is this: as they tell us about the opposites in ourselves, the ''way'' they tell us, the technique of poetry, shows that opposites can be one. The music of poetry...is the most important sign that opposites are one....In our studies with Eli Siegel, we have come to see poetry as having within it the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.  This is the education which makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel ===
In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), "a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, "Poet Outlines a Philosophy," ''Baltimore Sun,'' 2 August 1946: "More than 160 persons…attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight’s theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‘a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.’"&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in [[Greenwich Village]], where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.&lt;ref&gt;"From Here to Obscurity" by Michael Kernan, ''The Washington Post,'' 16 August 1978: "[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village…[Siegel] gave his first lessons….[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were [[Chaim Koppelman]] (1920–2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaimkoppelman.net/].&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, sculptor, printmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Trudie A. Grace, ''Same Objects/Different Visions: Etchings by Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman'' in ''Journal of the Print World'' (Winter, 2004) p. 36: "In the 1940s, Chaim Koppelman wanted to be a sculptor and then a painter, but in 1953 he switched to printmaking, attracted primarily by the potential for subtle chiaroscuro in the handling of form and atmospheric qualities as well as effects achieved in the biting of the plate."&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the printmaking department of the [[School of Visual Arts]], and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the [[Terrain Gallery]] in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff in the ''New York Post,'' Sunday, 16 June 1957: "An interesting aspect of the cultural life of this city within the past three years has been the development of the Terrain Gallery. There probably hasn’t been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‘Aesthetic Realism’ as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition….Aesthetic Realism is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art: "Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968." [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including [[Ralph Hattersley]], editor of the photography journal '' Infinity'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley, "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'' July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one; art shows this.’ Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nat Herz]], author of articles in '' Modern Photography'' and of the ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.''&lt;ref&gt;Nat Herz, ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,'' Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites "relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal,'' 1 September 1969: "Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‘all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.’ Since the 1940s, this poet-philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‘that the structure of reality is aesthetic.’ He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy.  A theatrical production of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen’s]] ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as "essentially good", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful?  I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life."&lt;/ref&gt; was highly praised in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kalem, ''Time,'' 19 December 1969, p. 58: "Now, in an off-off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman."&lt;/ref&gt; but severely criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kerr, "Hedda Is Not Candida," ''New York Times,'' 25 January 1970: "It is wholly boring and only boring….It doesn’t really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good.  All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Hedda Gabler: the Good Person," ''New York Times,'' 18 January 1970: "To see Ibsen’s wonderful and dangerous Hedda…as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright’s clear demands."&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence….As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor’s Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on [[Shakespeare]], [[Moliere]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], [[Strindberg]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealismtheatreco.org/outreach.htm Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism Foundation ===
The not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in [[SoHo]], New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, p.34, ''The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc., 1977): "The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life. In seminars, a consultation trio discusses aesthetic solutions to these problems, in terms of music, literature, poetry, painting, history, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Informing and educating the public has therefore become the primary task of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation…whose staff members conduct seminars, workshops, and consultation sessions." URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation offers classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, acting, and singing, and classes for children.&lt;ref&gt;Filomena Gomes, "Promising the world" in ''The Bergen Record'' 26 March 1999: "In a monthly program dubbed 'Learning to Like the World,' educators at the nonprofit foundation, established by Eli Siegel, work with children ages 5 to 12 to help them learn to use books as a tool to appreciate the world and the people around them....The world, according to the foundation’s philosophy, is made up of opposites: outside and inside, rest and motion. Similarly, children want to feel excited and feel at ease at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellen Reiss - 20050815.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ellen Reiss, Chairman of Education]]

In 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of [[Queens College|Queens]] and [[Hunter College]]s, [[City University of New York]]. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course "The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005) back cover: "Ellen Reiss is editor of the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' where her commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly. She is Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism, appointed by its founder, the philosopher, critic, and poet Eli Siegel; and is co-author, with Martha Baird, of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary.'' She teaches at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation and taught previously in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel died on November 8, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary, 10 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/tro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality===

A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight," ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently."&lt;/ref&gt;   Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to [[Obie]] award-winning actress Anne Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; ''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual." Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: "One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SKranz-and-AFielding.jpg|border|thumb|right|267px|alt=Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding|Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding (1980)]]

In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Homosexual Story" by Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', Issue #316, April 25, 1979. "Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'' show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elmhurst Press'' (Elmhurst, Illinois), "Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality," August 17, 1983, "Five formerly homosexual men…appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel…It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes."&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality" by Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‘Every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt;   Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Staub in ''Contemporary Authors.'' "The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‘every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.’ Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‘H Persuasion’--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women."&lt;ref&gt;"Instances of How Aesthetic Realism Sees A Matter of This Time" by Eli Siegel from ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'', show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): "It’s a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible….A person becomes educated…to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that…such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‘This is not what I want.’ Now, as I said…if people…really can say, ‘I like myself this way, really,’ –it’s not for me to say one way or the other."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. "Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 ''Free Time'' show&lt;ref&gt;''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''David Susskind Show'',&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a national syndication.  The book ''The H Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how.  In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality.  In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the ''David Susskind Show.''&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, editor, ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality'' (New York: Definition Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling ''The H Persuasion'' "less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''New York Times'' never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Green: "FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be" ''The Globe and Mail'', April 28, 1978, p.8 "Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists…who are mad at the ''New York Times'' because the ''Times,'' they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors.&lt;ref&gt;"Some News that’s Unfit to Print," ''New York Magazine'', 17 April 1978, p.8: "Though the ''New York Times'' does a fine job of covering Milanese fashions…it has somehow managed to overlook the Aesthetic Realism story. The Aesthetic Realists do not like this, and they are doing something about it….[They] have disrupted the ''Times'' city desk with more than 65 calls a day from people demanding that the story be run….What is more, the Aesthetic Realists have gone into the city streets, holding vigils in front of publisher Punch Sulzberger’s home and those of other top ''Times'' officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Many wore lapel buttons that read "Victim of the Press".&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, "Minority protesters trash First Amendment," ''St. Petersburg Times'', Wednesday, May 5, 1993, p. 11A. "For many years in New York's Greenwich Village, decorously dressed followers of poet and guru Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana") used to wear buttons proclaiming themselves ‘Victims of the Press.’"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Fischkin, ''Muddy Cup: a Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America'', (NY: Scribner) {{ISBN|0-684-80704-1}}, pages 231-232: "Linda Kunz wore a 'Victim of the Press' button on her lapel. On the first day of class, she wrote this on the blackboard: 'The purpose of all education is to like the world through knowing it--Eli Siegel.' And then this question: 'Can grammar, which is the structure of language, tell us anything about the structure of the world--including ourselves?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1987) ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3, p.158, pp. 127-8.  {{ISBN|0-691-02837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating "we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel." They were signed by 50 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, "We Have Changed from Homosexuality" March 18, 1978, ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.

The gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Roskoff, "Gay Activist Allen Roskoff Lets It All Out", ''Queerty'', "…they were telling the gay men that it was unnatural to be homosexual.  Only opposites could attract in art and in life.  The whole philosophy was about opposites, and of course that meant that homosexuality was wrong.  I guess they matched up or convinced men.  Whenever I saw a woman with a button, I would say, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t find a straight man?’  I detested these people. I mean, they were the ex-gay people."&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1982 ''Boston Globe'' article written by "the first openly gay reporter" on its staff,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 8, 2007.  "Generally regarded as the first openly gay reporter on the newspaper's staff…. Ms. Longcope, who spent 22 years at the ''Globe'' and then founded a statewide gay and lesbian newsweekly in her home state of Texas, died of pancreatic cancer March 28 in Hospice Austin's Christopher House."&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the "assertion" of change through Aesthetic Realism was "a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Longcope: "Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality," ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The assertion of change based on Aesthetic Realism is especially startling to professionals in the psychotherapeutic field after a decade of rethinking homosexuality—a process triggered by the Gay Liberation Movement."&lt;/ref&gt;  About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common.  The ''Globe’s'' ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained "strong, negative words without attribution" and "inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kierstead, Ombudsman, "''Globe'' article on ‘Aesthetic Realism’ and gays prompts complaints," ''The Boston Globe'', 24 May 1982. "On May 13, an estimated 250 people rallied on the Boston Common…in the case of The Boston Globe and the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City….The ''Globe'', once it decided to do the article…also assumed an obligation to spare no effort in thoroughly researching and investigating an organization which espouses a philosophy which is both complex and controversial. [Assistant Living Editor Ed Siegel] and writer Longcope believed that under the circumstances involved the story was fair….The ombudsman disagrees. The story, as published, contains a preponderance of material based on interviews with representatives of the gay community who, for the most part, are not un-biased in their views of Aesthetic Realism….The ombudsman believes the article, not intended as an exposé, contained a negative tone and strong negative words without attribution. It also contained inaccuracies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as "anti-gay", accusing the philosophy of offering a "gay cure" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Gay Cult Pulls Fast One" by Bill Schoell, ''The New York Blade'' April 25, 2008. "Unfortunately, Siegel and his followers believed that homosexuality was an illness ‘caused’ by self-contempt….In the 70s AR…heavily promoted the myth that they could convert people from gay to straight….New York’s Gay Activist Alliance responded by infiltrating [or "zapping"] their meetings at their Greene Street headquarters and passing out pro-gay literature."&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle.  The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight" ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "Ellen Reiss a teacher at the foundation said: ‘What we offer is a means to have people see themselves and the world as they truly are. We are not interested in grabbing people off the street and saying, "Change." If a person is gay and likes himself and the world and wants to stay that way, fine. But if a person wants to change we offer them a scientific logical approach.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to prejudice and racism==
{{Wide image|The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg|400px|''"The People of Clarendon County"—A Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.|50%|right|alt=alt text}}

In one of his earliest essays, "The Equality of Man" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting [[eugenics]]. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had "an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: "Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, "the addition to self through the lessening of something else." Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere "tolerance" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are "as real, and as deep, as one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Smith, Hickory, SC Branch, NAACP, "Back to School Rally Offers Answer to Racism," ''Hickory Daily Record,'' Friday, 21 August 2009: "The Belk Centrum Theater at Lenoir Rhyne University was packed Saturday for an intellectually stimulating Back to School Rally sponsored by the Hickory Branch NAACP....This demonstrates that people in this area are ready for new ideas in education and race relations.  Aesthetic Realism views contempt as the cause of racism, 'the addition to self through the lessening of something else'…. The criticism of contempt, including in oneself, and learning to see that the feelings of other people are as real and as deep as one's own, are essential in ending racism."&lt;/ref&gt;

On an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as "The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis," in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 13 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict "write a soliloquy of 500 words" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.&lt;ref&gt;Oron, Bernstein, Fishman, Gvili, Ratz, Levy, Shazar, "Contempt Must Be Studied for Mideast Terror to End!" ''Aesthetic Realism and the Answer to Racism,'' ed. Bernstein (Orange Angle Press, 2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: ''Asimbonanga,'' and ''Brushstrokes.'' Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, ''The Heart Knows Better,'' based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Black, ''The Heart Knows Better'', ''The Amsterdam News'', 28 October 1995: "The Heart Knows Better, produced by Ken Kimmelman of Imagery Film Ltd., was just awarded the Emmy for Outstanding National Public Service Film. The film addresses racial prejudice and was inspired by this...statement of Eli Siegel, the American poet and founder of Aesthetic Realism: 'It will be found that black and white man have the same goodnesses, the same temptations, and can be criticized in the same way. The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, "Alice Bernstein &amp; Friends."&lt;ref&gt;Robin H. King, ''South Carolina Black News'', 18 Dec. 2008: "Many people have been introduced to Alice Bernstein through her nationally published articles, and her column in the ''South Carolina Black News'' for the last five years.  She writes about what she learned  about the cause of and answer to racism from the educational philosophy, Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of ''The People of Clarendon County'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as "the education that can end racism." The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: "Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alice, ed., ''The People of Clarendon County--A Play by Ossie Davis with Photographs and Historical Documents, and Essays on the Education That Can End Racism'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007, p. xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

A production of ''The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.&lt;ref&gt;''CapitalWire'', Culture, 1 Nov. 2009: "House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn gave opening remarks at a historic event on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 21st: ''The People of Clarendon County—A Play by Ossie Davis &amp; the Answer to Racism!''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/jewishtimes.html Monumental Man: The Controversial Legacy of Eli Siegel], Melissa Goldman, Jewish Times, August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/political-surrealism/&lt;/ref&gt; Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled "Countering the Lies," saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is "1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't)."&lt;ref&gt;http://counteringthelies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO's constituent organizations are the European Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://eadh.org/ European Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (EADH), the Association for Computers and the Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ Association for Computers and the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (ACH), the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://csdh-schn.org/ Canadian Society for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (CSDH/SCHN), centerNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/ centerNet]&lt;/ref&gt; the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa-dh.org/ Australasian Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (aaDH), the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jadh.org/ Japanese Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (JADH) and Humanistica,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisti.ca Humanistica]&lt;/ref&gt; the french-speaking association for Digital Humanities.

==History==
The effort to establish the alliance began in [[Tübingen]], Germany, at the ALLC/ACH conference in 2002: a steering committee was appointed at the ALLC/ACH meeting in 2004, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and the executive committees of the ACH and [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]]  (ALLC) approved the governance and conference protocols at the 2005 meeting in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Canada. 
The [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] was also included.&lt;ref name="Unsworth" /&gt;
In 2007, the Alliance Steering Committee voted to enfranchise [[Society for Digital Humanities|The Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs]] (SDH/SEMI) of Canada.
In 2012,  centerNet, a network of digital humanities centers, became a "constituent organization" affiliated with ADHO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= centerNet to join ADHO |date= August 17, 2011 |work= ADHO centerNet blog |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/2011/08/centernet-to-join-adho |accessdate = October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities in 2013 and the French-speaking Association for Digital Humanities, Humanistica, in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Humanistica rejoint officiellement ADHO |date= July 15, 2016 |work= Humanistica website |url= http://www.humanisti.ca/humanistica-adho/ |accessdate = July 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO gained legal status as the Stichting ADHO Foundation (Netherlands) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedrijfnederland.nl/zuid-holland/den-haag/stichting-adho-foundation Stichting ADHO Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book discussing [[new religious movement]]s and the [[New Age]] movement, written by Ruth A. Tucker.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  The book was published in 1989 by [[Zondervan]],&lt;ref name="OCLC1"/&gt;  a Christian publishing house.&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt;  Another edition was released by the same publisher in 2004.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;

==Author==
Ruth A. Tucker is a former professor of [[missiology]] with a [[PhD]] from [[Northern Illinois University]].&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  Tucker has taught alternative religions at both the graduate and undergraduate level.&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt;  Her book ''Daughters of the Church'' was published in 1987.&lt;ref name="OCLC2"/&gt;  In 2000, Tucker was a professor at [[Calvin Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="HCharles"/&gt;  Tucker authored the book ''Walking Away from Faith'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="OCLC3"/&gt;

==Title==
The title "Another Gospel" is taken from [[Paul (apostle)|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]] in the [[New Testament]] verses 1:6-8: "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."&lt;ref name="McKnight2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 1:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''Another Gospel'' discusses a wide range of groups, including [[Mormonism]], [[Seventh-day Adventism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christian Science]], [[New Thought]] and [[Unity Church|Unity]], the [[Worldwide Church of God]], the [[Way International]], the [[Children of God (religious group)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], [[ISKCON|Hare Krishnas]], [[Bahá'ís]], and [[Scientology]].&lt;ref name="TOC"/&gt;  Other groups, including [[Rosicrucianism]] and [[Swedenborgianism]], are described in appendices.&lt;ref name="zondervan"/&gt;  Tucker discusses some of the controversies as related to these groups,&lt;ref name="Selverstone"/&gt;   while adding that frequently new religions maintain an "ability to reach out and meet the needs of people who are suffering and dejected."&lt;ref name="CohenBoyer"/&gt;

Tucker writes about the New Age movement, "The most popular and widely publicized new religion in recent years has been the New Age movement, a difficult-to-define variety of mystical, spiritualistic, and occultic groups that above all else are not ''new''. From channeling crystals to harmonic convergence, celebrities and ordinary citizens have been captivated by this increasingly popular religious trend."&lt;ref name="Nash"/&gt;  Tucker asks: "Is New Age merely an age-old form of the occult that will taper off in popularity as the fad loses its luster, or is it truly a movement that has only barely begun to make its all-encompassing mark on the world?"&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt; and warns that "every individual concerned about maintaining traditional Christian values should be apprehensive about the potential negative effect the New Age may have on the coming generations."&lt;ref name="Melton" /&gt;

In discussion of the Unification Church, Tucker writes that the organization has used controversial recruitment tactics which subsequently resulted in college students dropping out of universities in order to join it.&lt;ref name="gilfand"/&gt;  "The recruitment strategy of the Unification Church was widely criticized for utilizing tactics that sometimes were compared to brainwashing techniques," writes Tucker.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"/&gt;  ''Another Gospel'' describes how Unification Church founder [[Sun Myung Moon]] stated that he was told by [[Jesus Christ]] to complete a task in which Jesus had not succeeded, and carry out the desires of God on the earth.&lt;ref name="gilfand" /&gt;

Tucker notes a disparity between approaches to religious movements abroad compared to within a person's own cultural milieu.&lt;ref name="hexham" /&gt;  "In cross-cultural evangelism overseas, missionaries are admonished not to ridicule other religious beliefs or practices. ... Yet, these 'cross-cultural' courtesies are often blatantly ignored when they pertain to situations within our own culture. We often ridicule or mock the unorthodox religious beliefs of people in our own communities, because ''cultists'' do not deserve respect," writes Tucker.&lt;ref name="hexham"/&gt;

''Another Gospel'' delves into the difficulty in defining cults.&lt;ref name="gomes"/&gt;  Tucker says that a cult is "a religious group that has a 'prophet'-founder called of God to give a special message not found in the Bible itself".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  She comments on the defining characteristics utilized by [[sociologist]]s, who "have tended to define cults more in terms of lifestyle, proselytizing practices, and authoritarian leadership, rather than in terms of belief or by any standard of orthodoxy".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  According to Tucker cults often have a "prophet-founder" who serves as a "legalistic, authoritarian leader".&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;  In her given definition of a cult, Tucker writes, "In deference to this charismatic leader ... the style of leadership is authoritarian and there is frequently an exlusivistic outlook supported by a legalistic lifestyle and persecution mentality. ... It is the attribute of a prophet-founder that very distinctly separates cults from denominations."&lt;ref name="gomes" /&gt;

According to the description of the book from the publisher, Tucker "explains how ... alternative religious movements appear to meet people's needs."&lt;ref name="zondervan" /&gt; Tucker concludes that "the increase in cult membership is a direct result of a failure on the part of the church."&lt;ref name="Rhodes"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Charles H. Lippy, writing in ''Modern American Popular Religion: A Critical Assessment and Annotated Bibliography'', stated that ''Another Gospel'' is written "from a decidedly conservative Christian perspective", and although Tucker "does not ridicule the groups she seeks to expose ... it is clear that [she] does not see the groups she studies as legitimate religious alternatives."&lt;ref name="Lippy" /&gt;

[[Robert M. Bowman, Jr.]], reviewing ''Another Gospel'' for the ''[[Christian Research Journal]]'', commented: "Although Tucker is at her best in recounting the histories of the religions she surveys, at places she is not critical enough of the historical accounts that have been published by the cults themselves."  Bowman's review concluded, "... Ruth Tucker's ''Another Gospel'' is, in several respects, the best general textbook on the cults. It is more up-to-date, more readable, and more respectful of the cults than any other such textbook. But, because it is lacking in biblical critiques of the cults (which is understandable, given the author's areas of expertise), it cannot replace those books which do provide such critiques, however much fresh treatments are needed."&lt;ref name="bowman" /&gt;

A review of the book for the ''Journal of Christian Nursing'', said that the book provides information about "what people in various cults and religious groups believe", and called the book "outstanding", and recommended it for personal libraries and church libraries. The reviewer commented: "Although designed as a reference book, it is hard to put down. I started dipping into sections that interested me, then sat down and read the whole book. In the process, I felt as if I'd taken a semester course in alternative religions."&lt;ref name="jas" /&gt;

Author [[James Penton|M. James Penton]] wrote positively of the book, in his book ''Apocalypse Delayed'' published by [[University of Toronto Press]]. He wrote that Tucker's chapter on [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] "is far more superior to most older books and articles produced by Catholic and Protestant critics of the Watch Tower movement."&lt;ref name="penton" /&gt;

In a discussion of the prevalence of belief in [[reincarnation]] among adherents of various belief systems, ''Theology for the Community of God'' author [[Stanley Grenz|Stanley J. Grenz]] recommended Tucker's book "for references to the presence of this doctrine in the New Age movement".&lt;ref name="Grenz"/&gt;

The '''Astrophysics Research Institute''' ('''ARI''') is an [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] research institute located in [[Merseyside]], UK. Formed in 1992, the institute was situated on the [[Twelve Quays]] site in [[Birkenhead]] from 1998 to 2013, until in June 2013 the institute relocated to the Liverpool Science Park in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130707081939/http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2013 |title=Astrophysics Research Institute Joins Liverpool Science Park |accessdate=4 June 2013 |publisher=United Kingdom Science Park Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/NewsUpdate/viewarticle/803/All |title= Astrophysics is moving |accessdate= 7 June 2013 |date= 31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is in the top 1% of institutions in the field of [[space science]] as measured by total [[citation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.in-cites.com/institutions/LivplJhnMoresU-AstrphyResIns.html |title= An interview with: Liverpool John Moores University, Astrophysics Research Institute |date= March 2007 |accessdate= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 90 staff members and research students working at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/people |title= Staff at the Astrophysics Research Institute |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which lies within the administration of the [[Liverpool John Moores University]]'s Faculty of Engineering and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology |title= LJMU Faculty of Engineering and Technology |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Conducted research varies into many areas of astronomy and astrophysics, such as [[supernova]]e, [[star formation]] and [[galaxy clusters]]. Research is funded by external organisations, such as the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/gow/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |title=STFC Grants on the Web: Institution analysis |publisher=Stfc.ac.uk |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319220439/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/GOW/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/aboutari |title=Astrophysics Research Institute - Liverpool John Moores University |publisher=Astro.ljmu.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute maintains the [[Liverpool Telescope]] which is located on the island of [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/ | title = Liverpool Telescope | accessdate = 2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The institute currently teaches two undergraduate courses: a 3-year [[Bachelor of Science|BSc (Hons)]] in Physics and Astronomy, as well as a 4-year [[Master of Physics|MPhys (Hons)]] in Astrophysics. Both the undergraduate courses are taught as a [[Double degree|joint degree]] by the Astrophysics Research Institute of [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and the Department of Physics at the [[University of Liverpool]]. The courses are accredited by the [[Institute of Physics]].

Postgraduate courses are made available at [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and [[Master of Science|Master's]] level, with two MSc courses taught via [[distance learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/msc | title = Astrophysics MSc | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaccredited short courses are also made available to those who do not have a scientific or mathematical background. The Astronomy by Distance Learning courses are taught by CD-ROM, DVD and website material without the need for classroom sessions. Each of the courses provides an introduction into astronomy as well as specialist areas such as [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/info/index | title = Courses | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, the institute received the "''[[Queen's Anniversary Prize]]''" for higher education in recognition for its development of the robotic telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4717744.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Merseyside &amp;#124; Royal recognition for university |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the "''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement Award]]''" for 'project of the year' was given for the use of RINGO [[Polarimeter|optical polarimeter]] at the [[Liverpool Telescope]] in measuring [[gamma-ray bursts]]. RINGO has since been decommissioned and an updated polarimeter named RINGO2 is since in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/News/Archive/index.php?sf=s20071205 |title=The Liverpool Telescope: News : Archive : s20071205 |publisher=Telescope.livjm.ac.uk |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">'''Biological integrity''' is associated with how "pristine" an [[natural environment|environment]] is and its function relative to the potential or original state of an [[ecosystem]] before human alterations were imposed. Biological integrity is built on the assumption that a decline in the values of an ecosystem's [[Aquatic ecosystem#Functions|functions]] are primarily caused by human activity or alterations. The more an environment and its original processes are altered, the less biological integrity it holds for the [[community (ecology)|community]] as a whole. If these processes were to change over time naturally, without human influence, the integrity of the ecosystem would remain intact. The integrity of the ecosystem relies heavily on the processes that occur within it because those determine what [[organism]]s can inhabit an area and the complexities of their interactions.

==History==
The concept of biological integrity first appeared in the 1972 amendments to the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." Clean Water Act, section 101(a), {{USC|33|1251(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had used the term as a way to gauge the standards to which [[water]] should be maintained, but the vocabulary instigated years of debate about the implications of not only the meaning of biological integrity, but also how it can be [[Water quality#Measurement|measured]]. The first conference about the term occurred in March 1975 called "The Integrity of Water"&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, R.K. and L.J. Guarraia (editors)(1977). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/e673c95b11602f2385256ae1007279fe/0fdf60b25f9fc7b585256b0600723dc0!OpenDocument ''The Integrity of Water.''] Proceedings of a Symposium, March 10–12, 1975, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. EPA Publication No. 832-R-75-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  and provided the first accepted definition of biological integrity (see below). In 1981, EPA assembled a field of experts from the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], academia, and its own staff to further refine the definition and identify key [[bioindicator|indicators]] to quantitatively measure biological integrity. The conference not only identified a definition, but also methods to evaluate the community, and they established that multiple sites should be used to determine the condition of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.M., J.H. Gakstatter, M.A. Shirazi.and J.M. Omernik (1982). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf "An approach for determining biological integrity in flowing waters."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612221954/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }} Pages 877-888 in T.B. Brown (editor), ''In Place Resource Inventories: Principles and Practices, A National Workshop.'' Paper presented at the workshop August 9–14, 1981. [http://www.safnet.org Society of American Foresters], Bethesda, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Today, the accepted definition is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref&gt;Karr, J.R. and D.R. Dudley (1981). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf "Ecological perspectives on water quality goals."] [https://www.springer.com/environment/environmental+management/journal/267 ''Environmental Management''] 5:55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition was adapted from Frey (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Frey, D. 1977. [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf "Biological integrity of water: an historical approach."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084900/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} Pages 127-140 in Ballentine and Guarraia, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this definition are that [[living systems]] have a variety of scales relative to which they exist, that one can quantify the parts that sustain or contribute to a system's functioning and that all systems must be seen in the context of their environments and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] history. This term primarily refers to [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] because the vocabulary is derived from the Clean Water Act, but the concepts can be applied to other ecosystems.

==Evaluation methods==
In order to quantify and evaluate the biological integrity of a system, the '''[[Index of biological integrity|Index of Biological Integrity]] (IBI)''' was created.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. (1981). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf "Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613002834/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf |date=June 13, 2010 }} [http://afs.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-moreinfo&amp;issn=1548-8446 ''Fisheries'']{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 6:21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [https://archive.is/20120730211209/http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm Ecological Applications] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this index the baseline biological integrity (its function before human influence) and the current functions of an ecosystem are measured against one another to evaluate how much of ecosystem's function has been preserved. The IBI evaluates the ecosystem by utilizing [[biosurvey]]s and comparing [[species richness]], indicator [[taxon|taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and [[invasive species]]. IBIs are used primarily to evaluate [[aquatic ecosystem]]s even though one could technically apply any measurement of biological integrity to any natural ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">The '''Centre for Environmental Studies''' (CES) was an environmental think-tank in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1967 by the second [[Centre for Environmental Studies|Wilson government]] as an independent charitable trust for the purpose of advancing education and research in the planning and design of the physical environment. It began with $750,000 funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] and grants from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre for Environmental Studies|work=[[Hansard]] HC Deb 21 February 1967 vol 741 cc244-6W|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1967/feb/21/centre-for-environmental-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first director was [[Henry Chilver, Baron Chilver|A. H. Chilver]], Professor of Civil Engineering in the University of London. The centre began to assess the needs for research in planning the environment for human living, and to consider how and where this research could most effectively be undertaken.

Funding for the centre was withdrawn by the [[First Thatcher ministry|Thatcher government]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Centre for Environmental Studies|work=Hansard HC Deb 25 October 1979 vol 972 cc287-8W| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1979/oct/25/centre-for-environmental-studies#S5CV0972P0_19791025_CWA_253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre continued for some years as an independent body, closing in the 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/4640051.pdf|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System|last=Lugones|first=María|date=December 12, 2017|website=www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean. "For the Land: The Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination." Red Skin White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/patrilineal-vs-matrilineal-succession-3529192|title=Patrilineal vs. Matrilineal Succession|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Darcy|date=2009-04-01|title=Colonialism, Gender and the Family in North America: For a Gendered Analysis of Indigenous Struggles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x/abstract|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x|issn=1754-9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says "'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada.

== Colonialism of Gender in Asian ==
===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached.

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, they are still opportunities for women to hold positions in many industries and work area. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edmund Hodgson|first=Yates|date=1865|title=French Cochin China.|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/docview/6506789?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|journal=Temple bar : a London magazine for town and country readers, Dec. 1860-Dec. 1881; London|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Sangwha|date=1999|title=The Patriarchy in China: An Investigation of Public and Private Spheres.|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5(1)|pages=9-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

'''The Research Center of Economics, Land and Environment''' (abbreviated as CRETA) was created in [[Pisa]] as a center of independent research and as a link between university research and companies in the city, in order to design and implement plans turning theory into best daily practices and transfer to the companies the benefits of the latest research and help to raise their level of awareness.

In the first year of life, the association has been moving in different sectors, addressing issues related to sustainable development and the local economy, stimulate the creation of Districts of Social Economy, experiences of local currency, promote Ethical Finance and [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] &amp; Solidarity.

The project led to the creation of some art installations and a maxi eco-screen video projection. The work was presented and explained to the audience at two events, cultural and environmental issues in collaboration with other associations and local businesses in order to raise awareness and further stimulate people about the possibilities, practical and creative offers from recycling. With the time more and more time and attention went to issues related to energy and recycling. After local analysis combined with personal knowledge of organizations and companies working in the field of [[renewable energy]] and sustainable design in Pisa, finally CRETA decided to contribute towards more training among the public in order to promote knowledge of the renewable energy sources and promote their use, in other words, to spread awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31159">{{About|the sociological term|cities and locations|Capital of Culture (disambiguation){{!}}Capital of Culture}}

In sociology, '''cultural capital''' consists of the social assets of a person (education, intellect, style of speech and dress, etc.) that promote [[social mobility]] in a stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Music studies|last=J.P.E Harper-Scott and Jim Samson|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=52–55|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural capital functions as a social-relation within an economy of practices (system of exchange), and comprises all of the material and symbolic goods, without [[Distinction (sociology)|distinction]], that society considers rare and worth seeking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 5th Ed., (2009), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As a social relation within a system of exchange, cultural capital includes the accumulated cultural knowledge that confers [[social status]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0761973419&amp;id=ACA5u-F2PlMC&amp;pg=PA37 ''The Sage Dictionary of Cultural studies'' by Chris Barker]&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction" (1977), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] presented ''cultural capital'' to conceptually explain the differences among the levels of performance and academic achievement of children within the educational system of France in the 1960s; and further developed the concept in the essay "The Forms of Capital" (1985) and in the book ''The State Nobility: Élite Schools in the Field of Power'' (1996).

==Types of capital==
In the sociological essay, "The Forms of Capital" (1985), Pierre Bourdieu identifies three categories of capital:

# [[capital (economics)|Economic capital]]: command of economic resources (money, assets, property).
# [[Social capital]]: actual and potential resources linked to the possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Cultural capital''': A person's education (knowledge and intellectual skills) that provides advantage in achieving a higher social-status in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) pp. 46–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three types of cultural capital: (i) Embodied capital; (ii)  Objectified capital; and (iii) Institutionalised capital:

#'''Embodied cultural capital''' comprises the knowledge that is consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by [[socialization]] to culture and tradition. Unlike property, cultural capital is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. '''Linguistic cultural capital''' is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1990:114.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Objectified cultural capital''' comprises the person's property (e.g. a work of art, scientific instruments, etc.) that can be transmitted for economic profit (buying-and-selling) and for symbolically conveying the possession of cultural capital facilitated by owning such things. Yet, whilst possessing a work of art (objectified cultural-capital) the person can consume the art (understand its cultural meaning) only with the proper conceptual and historical foundations of prior cultural-capital. As such, cultural capital is not transmitted in the sale of the work of art, except by coincidental and independent causation, when the seller explains the artwork's significance to the buyer.
#'''Institutionalized cultural capital''' comprises an institution's formal recognition of a person's cultural capital, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is in the labor market (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a [[heuristic]] (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1986:47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitus and field==
The cultural capital of a person is linked to his or her [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (embodied disposition and tendencies) and [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] (social positions), which are configured as a social-relation structure.&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005:223&lt;/ref&gt; The field is the place of social position that is constituted by the conflicts that occur when social groups endeavour to establish and define what is cultural capital, within a given social space; therefore, depending upon the social field, one type of cultural capital can simultaneously be legitimate and illegitimate. In that way, the legitimization (societal recognition) of a type of cultural capital can be arbitrary and derived from [[symbolic capital]].

The habitus of a person is composed of the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispositions inculcated to him or her by family and the familial environment, and are manifested according to the nature of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 2002, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the social formation of a person's habitus is influenced by family,&lt;ref&gt;Harker ''et al.'', 1990, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; by objective changes in [[social class]],&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and by social interactions with other people in daily life;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, the habitus of a person also changes when he or she changes social positions within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical research==
The concept of cultural capital has received widespread attention all around the world, from theorists and researchers alike. It is mostly employed in relation to the education system, but on the odd occasion has been used or developed in other discourses. Use of Bourdieu's cultural capital can be broken up into a number of basic categories. First, are those who explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, are those who build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there are those who attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or to discount them in favour of an alternative theory. The majority of these works deal with Bourdieu's theory in relation to education, only a small number apply his theory to other instances of inequality in society.

===Traditional application===
Those researchers and theorists{{Who|date=October 2016}} who explore or employ Bourdieu's theory use it in a similar way as it was articulated by Bourdieu. They usually apply it uncritically,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and depending on the measurable indicators of cultural capital and the fields within which they measure it, Bourdieu's theory either works to support their argument totally, or in a qualified way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. These works to help portray the usefulness of Bourdieu's concept in analysing (mainly educational) inequality but they do not add anything to the theory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

One work which does employ Bourdieu's work in an enlightening way is that of Emirbayer &amp; Williams (2005) who use Bourdieu's notion of fields and capital to examine the power relations in the field of social services, particularly homeless shelters. The authors talk of the two separate fields that operate in the same geographic location (the shelter) and the types of capital that are legitimate and valued in each. Specifically they show how homeless people can possess "staff-sanctioned capital" or "client-sanctioned capital" (2005:92) and show how in the shelter, they are both at the same time, desirable and undesirable, valued and disparaged, depending on which of the two fields they are operating in. Although the authors do not clearly define staff-sanctioned and client-sanctioned capital as cultural capital, and state that usually the resources that form these two capitals are gathered from a person's life as opposed to their family, it can be seen how Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital can be a valuable theory in analyzing inequality in any social setting.

===Expansion===
A number of works expand Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital in a beneficial manner, without deviating from Bourdieu's framework of the different forms of capital. In fact, these authors can be seen to explore unarticulated areas of Bourdieu's theory as opposed to constructing a new theory. For instance, Stanton-Salazar &amp; Dornbusch (1995:121) examine how those people with the desired types of cultural (and linguistic) capital in a school transform this capital into "instrumental relations" or social capital with institutional agents who can transmit valuable resources to the person, furthering their success in the school. They state that this is simply an elaboration of Bourdieu's theory. Similarly, Dumais (2002) introduces the variable of gender to determine the ability of cultural capital to increase educational achievement. The author shows how gender and social class interact to produce different benefits from cultural capital. In fact in Distinction (1984:107), Bourdieu states "sexual properties are as inseparable from class properties as the yellowness of lemons is inseparable from its acidity". He simply did not articulate the differences attributable to gender in his general theory of [[cultural reproduction|reproduction]] in the education system.

On the other hand, two authors have introduced new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. Emmison &amp; Frow's (1998) work centers on an exploration of the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital. The authors state that "a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies of the information age can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing [[Digital divide|advantage on those families that possess them]]". Specifically computers are "machines" (Bourdieu, 1986:47) that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include cultural goods and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without.

Hage uses Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital to explore multiculturalism and racism in Australia. His discussion around race is distinct from Bourdieu's treatment of migrants and their amount of linguistic capital and habitus. Hage actually conceives of "whiteness" (in Dolby, 2000:49) as being a form of cultural capital. 'White' is not a stable, biologically determined trait, but a "shifting set of social practices" (Dolby, 2000:49). He conceptualizes the nation as a circular field, with the hierarchy moving from the powerful center (composed of 'white' Australians) to the less powerful periphery (composed of the 'others'). The 'others' however are not simply dominated, but are forced to compete with each other for a place closer to the centre. This use of Bourdieu's notion of capital and fields is extremely illuminating to understand how people of non-Anglo ethnicities may try and exchange the cultural capital of their ethnic background with that of 'whiteness' to gain a higher position in the hierarchy. It is especially useful to see it in these terms as it exposes the arbitrary nature of what is "Australian", and how it is determined by those in the dominant position (mainly 'white' Australians). In a path-breaking study, Bauder (2006) uses the notions of habitus and cultural capital to explain the situation of migrants in the labor market and society.

In the article "Against School" (2003), the retired teacher John Taylor Gatto addresses education in modern schooling. The relation of cultural capital can be linked to ''Principles of Secondary Education'' (1918), by Alexander Inglis, which indicates how American schooling is what like Prussian schooling in the 1820s. The objective was to divide children into sections, by distributing them by subject, by age, and by test score. Inglis introduces six basic functions for modern schooling; functions three, four, and five are related to cultural capital, and describe the manner in which schooling enforces the cultural capital of each child, from a young age. Functions three, four, and five are: '''3. Diagnosis and direction''':
School is meant to determine the proper social role of each student, by logging mathematic and anecdotal evidence into cumulative records. '''4. Differentiation''': Once the social role of a student is determined, the children are sorted by role and trained only as merited for his or her social destination. '''5. Selection''': This refers to Darwin's theory of natural selection applied to "the favored races".

The idea is to help American society, by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the socially unfit with poor grades, remedial-schooling  placement, and other notable social punishments that their peers will then view and accept them as intellectually inferior, and effectively bar them from the reproductive (sexual, economic, and cultural) sweepstakes of life. That was the purpose of petty humiliation in school: "It was the dirt down the drain." The three functions are directly related to cultural capital, because through schooling children are discriminated by [[social class]] and cognitively placed into the destination that will make them fit to sustain that social role. That is the path leading to their determined social class; and, during the fifth function, they will be socially undesirable to the privileged children, and so kept in a low social stratum.

Paul DiMaggio expands on Bourdieu's view on cultural capital and its influence on education saying: "Following Bourdieu, I measure high school students' cultural capital using self-reports of involvement in art, music, and literature." In his journal article titled Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students in the ''American Sociological Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2094962| title=Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students | journal=American Sociological Review | year=1982 | volume=47 | issue=2| doi = 10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Richard A. Peterson and A Simkus (1992) extended the cultural capital theory, exclusively on (secondary) analysis of survey  data on Americans, in 'How musical tastes mark occupational status groups', with the term "cultural omnivores" as a  particular higher status section in the US that has broader cultural engagements and tastes spanning an eclectic range from [[highbrow]] arts to [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding cultural omnivorousness, or the myth of the cultural omnivore | author=Alan Warde|author2=David Wright|author3=Modesto Gayo-Cal|author4=Tony Bennett|author5=Elizabeth Silva|author6= Mike Savage |url=http://sifo.no/files/Alanmfl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was Peterson (1992) who coined the term 'cultural omnivore' to address an anomaly observed in the evidence revealed by his work with Simkus (Peterson and Simkus, 1992) which showed that people of higher social status, contrary to elite-mass models of cultural taste developed by French scholars with French data, were not averse to participation in activities associated with popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Omnivores Versus Snobs? Musical Tastes in the United States and France | author=Christin, Angèle | year=2010 | publisher=Princeton University | url=http://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/workpap/WP40-Christin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work rejected the universal adaptation of the cultural capital theory, especially in the 20th century in advanced post-industrialist societies like the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=raPbbFuYOG4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA152 | title=Cultivating Differences: Symbolic Boundaries and the Making of Inequality | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Lamont, Michèle | year=1992 | isbn=9780226468143 | chapter=How Musical Tastes Mark Occupational Status Groups | editor1=Michèle Lamont | editor2=Marcel Fournier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Louise Archer and colleagues (2015) developed the concept of [[science capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=Dawson|first2=Emily|last3=DeWitt|first3=Jennifer|last4=Seakins|first4=Amy|last5=Wong|first5=Billy|date=2015|title="Science capital": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=52|pages=922–948|doi=10.1002/tea.21227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of science capital draws from the work of Bourdieu, in particular his studies focusing on the reproduction of social inequalities in society. Science capital is made up of science related cultural capital and [[social capital]] as well as [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]. It encapsulates the various influences that a young person's life experiences can have on their science identity and participation in science-related activities. The empirical work on science capital builds from a growing body of data into students' aspirations and attitudes to science, including [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/ ASPIRES] and [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/index.aspx Enterprising Science]. The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not. The concept provides policy makers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/162/162.pdf|title=Science communication and engagement Eleventh Report of Session 2016–17|last=House of Commons|first=|publisher=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee|year=2017|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/science-education-tracker-wellcome-feb16.pdf|title=Wellcome Trust: SET Development 2016|last=Wellcome Trust|first=|date=February 2016|website=Wellcome Trust|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a useful framework to help understand what shapes young people's engagement with (and potential resistance to) science.

Bourdieu's theory has been expanded to reflect modern forms of cultural capital, such as internet memes. Studies conducted by Asaf Nissenbaum and Limor Shifman &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444815609313&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic of internet memes; utilised the website [https://www.4chan.org/ 4chan] to analyse how these memes can be seen as forms of cultural capital. Discourse demonstrates the different forums and mediums that memes can be expressed through, such as different 'boards' on 4chan. 

==Criticism==
Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept have been made on many grounds, including a lack of conceptual clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2002|title=Bourdieu and Education: How Useful is Bourdieu's Theory for Researchers?|journal= Netherlands Journal of Social Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pp=144–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital, in order to examine which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2001|title=Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment|journal=Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=893–912|doi=10.1177/0038038501035004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1982|title=Cultural Capital and School Success|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=47|issue=2|pages=189–201|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Stratification%20%28Gender%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20Class%29%20Copies%20of%20Articles%20from%202009/DiMaggio-ASR-1982.pdf|doi=10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crook, C.

It has been observed that Bourdieu's theory, and in particular his notion of habitus, is entirely deterministic, leaving no place for individual agency or even individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1979|title=Review Essay: On Pierre Bourdieu|type=Review|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1460–74|doi=10.1086/226948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, A.|year=2000|title=Thinking with Bourdieu Against Bourdieu: A 'Practical' Critique of the Habitus|journal= Sociological Theory|volume=18|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bourdieu claimed to have transcended the dichotomy of structure and agency, this is not necessarily convincing. For example, the Oxford academic John Goldthorpe has long argued that:

{{quote|Bourdieu's view of the transmission of cultural capital as a key process in social reproduction is simply wrong. And the more detailed findings of the research, as noted above, could then have been taken as helping to explain just why it is wrong. That is, because differing class conditions do not give rise to such distinctive and abiding forms of habitus as Bourdieu would suppose; because even within more disadvantaged classes, with little access to high culture, values favouring education may still prevail and perhaps some relevant cultural resources exist; and because, therefore, schools and other educational institutions can function as important agencies of re-socialisation – that is, can not only underwrite but also in various respects complement, compensate for or indeed counter family influences in the creation and transmission of "cultural capital", and not just in the case of Wunderkinder but in fact on a mass scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Bourdieu has also been criticised for his lack of consideration of gender. Kanter (in Robinson &amp; Garnier, 1986) point out the lack of interest in gender inequalities in the labour market in Bourdieu's work. 
However, Bourdieu addressed the topic of gender head-on in his 2001 book ''Masculine Domination''. Bourdieu stated on the first page of the prelude in this book that he considered masculine domination to be a prime example of [[symbolic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourdieu, Pierre|year=2001|title=Masculine Domination|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep ecology''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] and [[environmental philosophy]] promoting the inherent worth of living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. 

Deep ecology argues that the natural world is a subtle balance of complex inter-relationships in which the existence of organisms is dependent on the existence of others within [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ecosystems are also considered to be dependent on other ecosystems within the [[biosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.

Deep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain inalienable legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as "deep" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.&lt;ref name="Smith2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes) since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions. Deep ecology takes a more [[holistic view]] of the world human beings live in and seeks to apply to life the understanding that the separate parts of the ecosystem (including humans) function as a whole. This philosophy provides a foundation for the [[environmental movement|environmental]], [[ecology movement|ecology]], and [[green movement]]s and has fostered a new system of [[environmental ethics]] advocating [[wilderness]] preservation, [[human population control]], and [[simple living]].&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161|isbn=9780415202855}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Origins ==
In his original 1972/73 deep ecology paper, [[Arne Næss]] claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists – who were out in the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were [[Rachel Carson]], [[David Brower]], and [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sessions |first=George |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology, New Conservation, and the Anthropocene Worldview |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1404/1658 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=106–114 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. ''Silent Spring'' helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.

The 1960s was a decade of vigorous social [[activism]] in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia. Some activism focused on war and peace and the issue of nuclear weapons. A well-known early environmental organization started with a focus on nuclear tests and their environmental hazards. Some people in British Columbia, Canada, were opposed to the test of a nuclear weapon by the US government on Amchitka Island. They hired a fishing vessel and sailed towards the nuclear test site in protest. This action led to the founding of [[Greenpeace]], which became more identified with environmental issues as time went by. These great movements were further catalyzed by the now iconic images of the whole Earth floating in space taken during the return of the Apollo space missions from their journey to the moon. Among the astronauts that witnessed seeing the whole Earth firsthand was [[Edgar D. Mitchell]], who in 1971, during the return mission of Apollo 14, had an epiphany that what is needed to solve the eco-crisis "is a transformation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alan |last1=Drengson |first2=Bill |last2=Devall |first3=Mark A. |last3=Schroll |date=2011 |title=The Deep Ecology Movement: Origins, Development, and Future Prospects (Toward a Transpersonal Ecosophy) |journal=International Journal of Transpersonal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=101–117 |doi=10.24972/ijts.2011.30.1-2.101 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

Proponents of deep ecology believe that the world does not exist as a [[natural resource|resource]] to be freely [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] by humans. If material goods do not guarantee happiness beyond a very moderate level, and over-consumption is endangering the biosphere, defining a new non-consumptive paradigm of well-being seems primordial, such a paradigm would be non-acquisitive/non-consumerist and non-hierarchical in relation to our place on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Tom|last2=Guyas|first2=Anniina Suominen|title=Earth Education, Interbeing, and Deep Ecology|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=53|issue=3|year=2015|pages=223–245|issn=0039-3541|doi=10.1080/00393541.2012.11518865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics of deep ecology hold that the survival of any part is dependent upon the well-being of the whole. Proponents of deep ecology offer an eight-tier platform to elucidate their claims:

{{quotation|
*The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves. These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
*Richness and [[diversity of life]] forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves
*Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs
*The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the [[human population]]. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
*Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening
*Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
*The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating [[life quality]] (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between ''big'' and ''great''.
*Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

==Development==
The phrase "deep ecology" was coined by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Naess1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Næss|first1=Arne|title=The shallow and the deep, long‐range ecology movement. A summary|journal=Inquiry|volume=16|issue=1–4|year=1973|pages=95–100|issn=0020-174X|doi=10.1080/00201747308601682|url=http://wildsreprisal.com/PDF's/Cascadia%20Rising/The%20shallow%20and%20the%20deep,%20long-range%20ecology%20movement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss rejected the idea that beings can be ranked according to their relative value. For example, judgments on whether an animal has an eternal [[soul]], whether it uses [[reason]] or whether it has [[consciousness]] (or indeed [[higher consciousness]]) have all been used to justify the ranking of the [[human|human animal]] as superior to other animals. Næss states that from an ecological point of view "the right of all forms [of life] to live is a universal right which cannot be quantified. No single species of living being has more of this particular right to live and unfold than any other species."{{fact|date=November 2018}}

This [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] idea is elucidated in [[Warwick Fox]]'s claim that humanity and all other beings are "aspects of a single unfolding reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick, (1990) ''Towards a Transpersonal Ecology'' (Shambhala Books)&lt;/ref&gt;  As such deep ecology would support the view of [[Aldo Leopold]] in his book  ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' that humans are "plain members of the biotic community". They also would support [[Land ethic#Aldo Leopold's land ethic|Leopold's land ethic]]: "a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the [[biocoenosis|biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."  Daniel Quinn, in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', showed that an anthropocentric myth underlies our current view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel (1995), "Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit" (Bantam)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological problems faced by the world today are partly due to the loss of traditional knowledge, values, and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance. Correspondingly, the assumption of human superiority to other life forms, as if we were granted royalty status over Nature - the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose - receives a radical critique in deep ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deep ecology developed a response to the anthropocentric view and several different actors played an important historical role in its development. Prominent among them was [[Joseph W. Meeker]], who in 1973 told [[George Sessions]] about Arne Næss, whom Meeker knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Merle|title=Sustainable development and deep ecology: An analysis of competing traditions|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=477–488|doi=10.1007/BF02400853|issn=0364-152X|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Warwick Fox related, "One of the things that initially interested Sessions about Næss was Næss's strong interest in, and innovative approach to, the work of Spinoza. Sessions says that he had himself 'arrived at Spinoza as the answer to the process of teaching history of philosophy by about 1972 and independently of being in contact with Næss.'"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Sessions therefore wrote to Næss at this time, beginning a lifelong association. Meeker's (1972, 1997) book ''The Comedy of Survival: Studies in Literary Ecology'' emerged through the work of scholars seeking an environmental ethic. That book represents Meeker's founding work in literary ecology and [[ecocriticism]], which demonstrates the relationship between the literary arts and scientific ecology, especially humankind's consideration of comedy and tragedy. It reminds readers that adaptive behaviors (comedy) promote survival, whereas tragedy estranges from other life forms. This thesis rests on Meeker's study of comparative literature, his work with biologist [[Konrad Lorenz]], and his work as a field ecologist in the National Park service in Alaska, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deep ecology offers a philosophical basis for environmental advocacy which may, in turn, guide human activity against perceived self-destruction. Deep ecology and [[environmentalism]] hold that the science of ecology [[History of ecology|shows]] that [[ecosystem]]s can absorb only limited change by humans or other dissonant influences. Further, both hold that the actions of modern civilization threaten global ecological well-being. Ecologists have described change and stability in ecological systems in various ways, including [[homeostasis]], [[dynamic equilibrium]], and "flux of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-First Century.'' Oxford Univ. Press, NY, NY. {{ISBN|0-19-507469-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which model is most accurate, [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} contend that massive human economic activity has pushed the [[biosphere]] far from its "natural" state through reduction of [[biodiversity#Ecological role of biodiversity|biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and other influences. As a consequence, civilization is causing [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] at a rate between 100 species a day and possibly 140,000 species a year, which is 10,000 times the background rate of extinction. Deep ecologists hope to influence social and political change through their philosophy. Næss has proposed, as [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] writes, "that the earth’s human population should be reduced to about 100 million."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"/&gt;

== Environmental education ==
Ecology in the narrow sense refers to the biological science of [[ecology]]. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have to do with the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes.&lt;ref name="Smith2014" /&gt; Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriate because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.

Ecopedagogy calls for the remaking of capitalist practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests in the face of our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education.  In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|url=http://jsd.sagepub.com/content/9/1/101|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101–116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misiaszek|first1=Greg William|title=Ecopedagogy and Citizenship in the Age of Globalisation: connections between environmental and global citizenship education to save the planet|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=50|issue=3|year=2015|pages=280–292|issn=01418211|doi=10.1111/ejed.12138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics:

* Goal-setting as the projected results reflects a model of environmentally responsible personality, taking into account trends in the development of key elements of education system; all natural sciences are involved in the development of basic ecological concepts.

* The introduction of interactive training methods takes place at the high school level in teaching self-reflection, hypothesizing, predicting; school natural science education is rebuilt on the basis of system approach in accordance with the planned ecologization results. Implementation of relevant methodology will promote successful development of environmentally responsible personality in high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015" /&gt;

In higher education, the analysis of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” provides an example of how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her book ''Wild Children — Domesticated Dreams: Civilization and the Birth of Education'', [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that the current institutions responsible for the construction and transmission of civilized epistemology are driven by the destructive premises at the foundation of civilization and human predatory culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild children--domesticated dreams : civilization and the birth of education|last=Layla.|first=AbdelRahim|date=2013|publisher=Fernwood Pub|isbn=9781552665480|location=Winnipeg|oclc=829422058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to return to a viable socio-environmental culture, AbdelRahim calls for the rewilding of our anthropology (i.e. our place among other species) and of pedagogical culture, which in civilization is based on the same domestication methods of other animals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Næss and Fox do not claim to use [[logic]] or [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] to derive the philosophy directly from scientific ecology&lt;ref name="Naess1973" /&gt; but rather hold that scientific ecology directly implies the metaphysics of deep ecology, including its ideas about the self and further, that deep ecology finds scientific underpinnings in the fields of [[ecology]] and [[system dynamics]].

In their 1985 book ''Deep Ecology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Devall and George Sessions describe a series of sources of deep ecology.  They include the science of ecology itself, and cite its major contribution as the rediscovery in a modern context that "everything is connected to everything else."  They point out that some ecologists and natural historians, in addition to their scientific viewpoint, have developed a deep ecological consciousness—for some a [[political consciousness]] and at times a [[spiritual consciousness]].  This is a perspective beyond the strictly human viewpoint, beyond [[anthropocentrism]].  Among the scientists they mention specifically are [[Rachel Carson]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Livingston (naturalist)|John Livingston]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Barry Commoner]], together with [[Frank Fraser Darling]], [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Paul Sears]].

A further scientific source for deep ecology adduced by Devall and Sessions is the "new physics", which they describe as shattering [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s vision of the universe as a machine explainable in terms of simple [[linear]] cause and effect. They propose that Nature is in a state of constant flux and reject the idea of observers as existing independent of their environment.  They refer to [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]'' for their characterisation of how the new physics leads to metaphysical and ecological views of interrelatedness, which, according to Capra, should make deep ecology a framework for future human societies. Devall and Sessions also credit the American poet and social critic [[Gary Snyder]]—with his devotion to [[Buddhism]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] studies, the outdoors, and alternative social movements—as a major voice of wisdom in the evolution of their ideas.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] was also an influence on the deep ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual===
The central spiritual tenet of deep ecology is that the human species is a part of the Earth, not separate from it, and as such human existence is dependent on the diverse organisms within the natural world each playing a role in the natural economy of the biosphere. Coming to an awareness of this reality involves a transformation of an outlook that presupposes humanity's superiority over the natural world. This self-realisation or "re-earthing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Ecology &amp; re-earthing ~ Q&amp;A|url=http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/deepeco.html|work=users.on.net/~arachne/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for an individual to intuitively gain an ecocentric perspective. The notion is based on the idea that the more we ''expand the self'' to identify with "others" (people, animals, ecosystems), the more we realize ourselves.  [[Transpersonal psychology]] has been used by [[Warwick Fox]] to support this idea.  Deep ecology has influenced the development of contemporary [[ecospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritual and philosophical traditions including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] are drawn upon in a continuing critique of the philosophical assumptions of the modern European mind which has enabled and led to what is seen as an increasingly unsustainable level of disregard towards the rights and needs of the natural world and its ability to continue to support human life. In relation to the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, Næss offers the following criticism: "The arrogance of stewardship [as found in the [[Bible]]] consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the [[God|Creator]] and Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Næss, Arne. (1989). ''Ecology, Community and Lifestyle: Outline of an Ecosophy''. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-521-34873-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theme had been expounded in [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]'s 1967 article "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Næss' further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use: a view used frequently in the past to exploit and dispossess native populations.  Many Protestant sects today regard the Bible's call for man to have stewardship of the earth as a call for the care for creation, rather than for exploitation.

The original Christian teachings on property support the Franciscan/stewardship interpretation of the Bible. Against this view, Martin Luther condemned church ownership of lands because "they did not want to use that property in an economically productive fashion. At best they used it to produce prayers. Luther, and other Reformation leaders insisted that it should be used, not to relieve men from the necessity of working, but as a tool for making more goods. The attitude of the Reformation was practically, "not prayers, but production." And production, not for consumption, but for more production." This justification was offered to support secular takings of church endowments and properties.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Richard (1951). Private Property: the History of an Idea. (Rutgers Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Layla AbdelRahim]] sees the root of the anthropogenic degradation of the biosphere in the anthropology that constructs the human animal as the supreme predator. The ontological explanation offered for Human Supremacy by both science and religion, she says, alienate the human being from the community of life and allow for an immoral control and destruction of the wilderness, which, according to her contains the spirit and intelligence of life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Philosophical roots ===

==== Spinoza ====
[[Arne Næss]], who first wrote about the idea of deep ecology, from the early days of developing this outlook conceived [[Baruch Spinoza]] as a philosophical source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Naess | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1007/BF02379991 | title = Spinoza and ecology | journal = Philosophia | volume = 7 | pages = 45–54 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have followed Næss' inquiry, including Eccy de Jonge, in ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Jonge |first=Eccy |date=April 28, 2004 |title=Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism (Ashgate New Critical Thinking in Philosophy)  |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=978-0754633273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brenden MacDonald, in ''Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity—Realization of Eco-Literacies''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Brenden James|date=2012-05-14|title=Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity -- Schizophrenics and Others Who Could Heal the Earth If Society Realized Eco-Literacy|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/1229|journal=Trumpeter|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=89–101|issn=1705-9429}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--http://www.environment-ecology.com/deep-ecology/63-deep-ecology.html mentions it --&gt;.

One of the topical centres of inquiry connecting Spinoza to Deep Ecology is "self-realization."  See Arne Næss in ''The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology movement'' and ''Spinoza and the Deep Ecology Movement'' for discussion on the role of Spinoza's conception of self-realization and its link to deep ecology.

==Criticism, debate, and response==

===Knowledge of non-human interests===
Animal rights activists state that for an entity to require rights and protection [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsically]], it must have interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology is criticised for assuming that living things such as plants, for example, have their own interests as they are manifested by the plant's behavior—for instance, self-preservation being considered an expression of a will to live. Deep ecologists claim to ''identify'' with non-human nature, and in doing so, deny those who claim that non-human (or non-sentient) lifeforms' needs or interests are nonexistent or unknowable. The criticism is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests. This is sometimes construed as a [[pathetic fallacy]] or [[anthropomorphism]], in which "the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==="Deepness"===
Deep ecology is criticised for its claim to being ''deeper'' than alternative theories, which by implication are ''shallow''. When [[Arne Næss]] coined the term ''deep ecology'', he compared it favourably with ''shallow environmentalism'' which he criticized for its [[utilitarian]] and [[anthropocentric]] attitude to nature and for its [[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[consumerism|consumer-oriented]] outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=Great River Earth Institute
| url=http://www.greatriv.org/de.htm
| title=Deep Ecology: Environmentalism as if all beings mattered
| accessdate=2006-04-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this is [[Arne Næss]]'s own view that the "depth" of deep ecology resides in the persistence of its penetrative questioning, particularly in asking "Why?" when faced with initial answers.

Writer William D. Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is "a hopeless quest". He seeks an improved "shallow" view, writing, "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookchin's criticisms===
Some critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic|hateful toward humanity]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998). ''[[Hitler's Priestess]]: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"&gt;{{cite web

therefore asserts that "deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like Paul Shepard into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve".&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; However, Bookchin himself later admitted that "statements made by Earth First! activists are not to be confused with those made by deep ecology theorists".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecophilosopher [[Warwick Fox]] similarly "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does ''not'' mean that deep ecology is misanthropic."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"/&gt; Likewise, ''The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology'' attempts to clarify that "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of [[anthropocentrism]], so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" and "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deep Ecology Movement|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA|year=1995|editor=Alan Drengson and Yuichi Inoue|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M4SwWkKLZ4C&amp;printsec=onepage&amp;q=262|isbn=9781556431982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that "can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Though some deep ecologists may reject the argument that ecological behavior is rooted in the social paradigm (which, according to their view, would be an anthropocentric fallacy), others in fact embrace this argument, such as the adherents to the deep ecologist movement [[Deep Green Resistance]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; has likened deep ecology to its antithesis, the [[wise use]] movement, when he says that they both "misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus." Elsewhere, though, he asserts that deep ecology must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature because it challenges the fundamental assumptions of [[Western philosophy]]. Botkin has also criticized Næss's restatement and reliance upon the balance of nature idea and the perceived contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].

=== Response ===
Some writers have misunderstood Næss, taking his ecosophy T, with its self-realization norm, as something meant to characterize the whole deep ecology movement as part of a single philosophy called "deep ecology". Næss was not doing either of these. He emphasized that movements cannot be precisely defined, but only roughly characterized by very general statements. They are often united internationally by means of such principles as found in the United Nations (UN) Earth Charter (1980), and in UN documents about basic human rights. Næss was doing something more subtle than many thought. He was not putting forth a single worldview and philosophy of life that everyone should adhere to in support of the international ecology movement. Instead, he was making an empirical claim based on overwhelming evidence that global social movements, from the grass roots up, consist of people with very diverse religious, philosophical, cultural, and personal orientations. Nonetheless, they can agree on certain courses of action and certain broad principles, especially at the international level. As supporters of a given movement, they can treat one another with mutual respect. Because of these misunderstandings Næss introduced an apron diagram to clearly illustrate his subtle distinctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The apron diagram is meant to illustrate logical, as distinct from genetic, relations between views and their connection with social movements, policies and practical actions. By "logical relations" this means verbally articulated relations between the premises and conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is collective cooperation on global concerns, and yet a great variety of ultimate premises from which each person or group acts locally. Within global movements there is diversity at the local level because each place and community is different and must adapt to its unique setting. Thus, Næss stressed that his ecosophy T is not meant to hold for everyone, since it is tailored to his very modest lifestyle suitable to a place such as Tvergastein. The ultimate premises for his whole view might be conceptually incompatible with those in someone else's whole views. But even if this is true, they could both support the platform principles of the deep ecology movement and other social-political global movements, such as for peace and social justice. In recognizing the principle that all living beings have intrinsic worth, there is an acknowledgement that they are good for their own sake. This does not mean committing to biocentric equality or egalitarianism between species. Within the vast diversity of living beings, there are complex relationships the range of which is predation, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis. Many think that symbiosis and complementarity are important values to embrace as they are consistent with global cooperation, community life, and support for the deep ecology movement platform.

==Ecofeminist response==
Ecofeminism and deep ecology have been in dialogue for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting with the natural world may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, [[weasel words|some]] have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diehm |first=Christian |date=2003 |title=The Self of Stars and Stone: Ecofeminism, Deep Ecology, and the Ecological Self |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/79/79 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=31–45 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first=Annie |date=2000 |title=Ways of Knowing: Acceptable Understandings Within Bioregionalism, Deep Ecology, Ecofeminism, and Native American Cultures |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/145/170 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=1 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fellenz|first=Marc R.|title=The Moral Menagerie|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/611905|language=English|isbn=9780252091186|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.

Both [[ecofeminism]] and deep ecology put forward a new conceptualization of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as [[Marti Kheel]],&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, Marti. (1990): ''Ecofeminism and Deep Ecology; reflections on identity and difference'' from: Diamond, Irene. Orenstein. Gloria (editors), ''Reweaving the World; The emergence of ecofeminism''.

San Francisco. pp 128-137. {{ISBN|0-87156-623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places too much emphasis on the whole, at the expense of the independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of [[androcentrism]] rather than [[anthropocentrism]]. To others, like [[Karen J. Warren]], the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract [[individualism]] and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as [[racism]] or [[speciesism]], are all forms of [[discrimination]] and are no different from [[sexism]]. Thus, [[anthropocentrism]] is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed [[value system|value structure]] and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren|first=Karen J.|authorlink=Karen J.

Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] has attempted to avoid these conflicts and criticisms through her [[Work that Reconnects]].  By focussing deep ecology on the experience of the consciousness of personal depth within the participant, she speaks of "the greening of the self", which is part of the epochal journey of our times from an [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]ic or [[egotistical]] self to an ecological self.

==Links with other philosophies==
Parallels have been drawn between deep ecology and other philosophies, in particular those of the [[animal rights]] movement, [[Earth First!]], [[Deep Green Resistance]], and [[anarcho-primitivism]].

[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration. This can be seen as a part of a process of expanding the prevailing system of ethics to wider groupings. However, Singer has disagreed with deep ecology's belief in the intrinsic value of nature separate from questions of suffering, taking a more utilitarian stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Gillian (May 2011 ). [http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/425/the_greater_good The Greater Good: Peter Singer On How To Live An Ethical Life]. ''Sun Magazine'', The Sun Interview, Issue 425. Retrieved on: 2011-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminism|feminist]] and [[civil rights movement]]s also brought about expansion of the ethical system for their particular domains. Likewise deep ecology brought the whole of nature under moral consideration.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The links with [[animal rights]] are perhaps the strongest, as "proponents of such ideas argue that 'All life has intrinsic value'".&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite book

Many in the radical environmental direct-action movement [[Earth First!]] claim to follow deep ecology, as indicated by one of their slogans ''No compromise in defence of mother earth''. In particular, [[David Foreman]], the co-founder of the movement, has also been a strong advocate for deep ecology, and engaged in a public debate with [[Murray Bookchin]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judi Bari]] was another prominent Earth Firster who espoused deep ecology. Many Earth First! actions have a distinct deep ecological theme; often these actions will be to save an area of [[old growth forest]], the habitat of a snail or an owl, even individual trees. Actions are often symbolic or have other political aims. At one point Arne Næss also engaged in environmental direct action, though not under the Earth First! banner, when he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], in a successful protest against the building of a dam.&lt;ref&gt;J.

There are also [[anarchism|anarchist]] currents in the movement, especially in the United Kingdom. For example, [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]], pioneer of [[forest gardening]] in temperate climates, wrote the essay "Can Life Survive?" in ''Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism|publisher=Freedom Press|year=1993|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Deep_Ecology___Anarchism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-15-683800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the [[Kykeon]], the [[sacrament]] used during the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[ancient Greece]] between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an ethnomycologist as such, [[philologist]] [[John Allegro]] has made an important contribution suggesting, in a book controversial enough to have his academic career destroyed, that ''Amanita muscaria'' was not only consumed as a sacrament but was the main focus of worship in the more [[esoteric]] sects of [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian religion]], [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-340-12875-5
  | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Heinrich]] claims that ''Amanita muscaria'' use in Europe was not completely wiped out by [[Orthodox Christianity]] but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as [[medieval]] [[Holy Grail]] [[myth]] makers, [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[Renaissance]] artists.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

Until the 1990s, the Uniform '''ETP''' Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-presentation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; '''Auditing''' (3.5 hours); '''Business Law''' (3.5 hours); '''Human Resource Theory''' (3.5 hours); and''' STATICO''' Practice (Part I &amp; Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although '''Training Practice''' I and '''MBFIS '''Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In '''1994''', the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between '''Education Theory''' and '''Training Practice''' (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed by'''ETPs''' to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to '''ETP''' candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc-et.com/european-training-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Human Resource''' and Professional Responsibilities
* '''Management Information Systems'''
* '''Accounting and Reporting Banking''' – Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-deroulement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Financial Accounting and Reporting''' – Business Enterprises
Until '''1996''', completely new versions of the '''ETP Exam''' were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders.

==Sections and topics covered==
The sections have been reorganized as follows:
* '''Management Of Banking &amp; Finance International Systems''' (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) – This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.
* '''Management of Human Resource''' (4.0 hours):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/european-training-programs.html [ Brochure for ISG.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; (MHR) – This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.
*''' STATICO''' (4.0 hours): (REG) – This section covers knowledge of statics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.
* '''[[Management Information Systems]]''' (4.5 hours): (MIS) – This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.
The Uniform '''ETP Exam''' tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as '''Management''', '''auditing''' and '''accounting standards''', the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialnewsline.com/finance/changes-to-the-cpa-exam-in-january-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Every effort is made to avoid asking about subject matter that may have different correct answers in different jurisdictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19609">'''Hack''' is a term used primarily in [[stand-up comedy]], but also [[sketch comedy]], [[improv comedy]], and [[comedy writing]] to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by [[comedian]]s in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author.  Alternatively, it may refer to a [[comedian]] or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act.  Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.

The word "hack" is derived from the British term "hackneyed" meaning, "over used and thus cheapened, or trite".&lt;ref name="stasonhack"&gt;"http://stason.org/TULARC/art/hack-stand-up-comedy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess.  This renders the topic "hack" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.

Reusing humor can also be [[joke thievery]] if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.

==History==
From the [[Borscht Belt|Catskill]] and [[Vaudeville]] beginnings of [[stand-up comedy]], hacking was common&lt;ref name="radartake_3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |title=From The Magazine : Radar Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122182110/http://radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_3.php |archive-date=2009-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.

In the late fifties and early sixties, [[Will Jordan]] perfected a caricature performance of [[Ed Sullivan]] (incorporating mispronouncing the word "show" as "shoe") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;  Soon after, [[Jackie Mason]], [[Rich Little]] and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt; [[John Byner]], in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that [[George Carlin]] cited as being set up with the words, "Now you know!"

In the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

In the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=Kevin Booth and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903194637/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Rogan |first=Joe |work= Playboy Magazine |date= October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |title= Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions |author= Tim McIntire |year=1998 |publisher= BillHicks.com |archivedate= 2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

Also in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of [[Bill Cosby]], the style of which was first unveiled by [[Eddie Murphy]] in his concert ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw|Raw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/movies/eddie-murphy-raw.html | title='Eddie Murphy Raw'  | author=Janet Maslin | publisher=New York Times | year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. [[Louis CK]] has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'' that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album ''Live in Houston''. This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble "My Real Name", a bit from [[Steve Martin]]'s album, ''A Wild and Crazy Guy''.&lt;ref name="dead frog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Todd |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/steal_this_joke_louis_ck_vs_dane_cook_vs_steve_martin/ |title=Steal this Joke: Louis C.K. vs. Dane Cook vs. Steve Martin &amp;#124; Dead-Frog - A Comedy Blog |publisher=Dead-Frog |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2010}}

[[Joe Rogan]], by contrast has been very open in accusing [[Carlos Mencia]] of hacking.&lt;ref name="monstersandcritics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1265383.php/Joe_Rogan_confronts_Carlos_Mencia_at_Comedy_Store |title=Joe Rogan confronts Carlos Mencia at Comedy Store - People |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce - Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|title=Luttazzi copia - Parte 1|accessdate=2010-06-11|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html|archive-date=2010-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml |title= Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7 |date= 10 March 2012 |accessdate= 10 March 2012 |publisher= corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi calls his ruse "the Lenny Bruce trick" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a "nugget", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/144|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2005-10-24 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi also calls the charges "naive", explaining why those jokes are not "plagiarized", but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context.&lt;ref name="blo_lut2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/811|title=Tecnica della diffamazione moderna|accessdate=2010-10-15 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.&lt;ref name="blo_lut3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/node/324|title=Caccia al tesoro|accessdate=2007-12-11 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - "I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste" - had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Blogger and comedian [[Troy Holm]] was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his Blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archive-date=2012-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Stanhope |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_%28album%29 |title=Sicko (album) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==Hacking in the media==
Hacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.

[[Dick Cavett]] and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.

Allen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful [[television]] show, ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''Family Guy'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from ''The Simpsons''. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V. Club | publisher = Onion Inc. | quote = The rivalry is very affectionate...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyguy.tktv.net/news.html |title=Timeline at familyguy.tktv.net|quote=You know, it's funny. Matt Groening and I actually have a great relationship...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

Typically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the [[Comedy Store]] in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, [[Ari Shaffir]], as a comedian who opens for "Carlos Men-steal-ia".&lt;ref name="rogan-video"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407105943/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=53945 |archive-date=2007-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he "take a break" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070215/ENTERTAIN/70215009 |title=Joe Rogan and Carlos Mencia face off at comedy club |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, ''JoeShow''. It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.&lt;ref name="rogan-video"/&gt;

Joe Rogan said, "People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'"&lt;ref name="radartake_3" /&gt;

The [[internet]], however, has opened up a new medium for "outing" a hack. Websites like [[YouTube]] allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from [[Doug Stanhope]] and posted them to his [[blog]] under the guise of having written them, himself.

'''Harlem Children Society''' (HCS) is a [[non-profit organization]] that arranges for students from under-resourced and under-served communities to be placed as interns at academic research labs during a summer research program.  In addition to the lab experience, students receive a stipend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/harlem-children-society-searches-for-the-einstein/81123/|title=Harlem Children Society Searches for the Einstein of the Bronx|work=The New York Sun|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participating institutions include [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].

Students undertake their own research, which is presented during a street science fair in their own community, under the guidance of scientists. The students are able to pursue their scientific investigations during the following school semester in an after-school program.  Additionally, these students attend weekly lectures on a variety of topics ranging from incorporating science into communities to financing a college education, while also having the option to visit college campuses and to receive help preparing for the SATs.

==History and origins==
Satyajit Bhattacharya founded HCS on June 5, 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By 2010, the program had expanded to 12 countries, serving more than 750 students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/07/education-taking-science-into-the-streets/|title=EDUCATION: Taking Science into the Streets {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of their mentees in the United States, as of 2010, 40% are African-American, 26% are of Hispanic descent, and 16% are Native Americans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

HCS aims to increase awareness in the sciences, medicine, engineering and mathematics.  It provides an opportunity for under-privileged high school aged students throughout to world succeed academically as well as in all other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stacey |first1=Georgia |title=Worms May Hold Clues to Neurological Disorders |url=https://www.livescience.com/11034-worms-hold-clues-neurological-disorders.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krueger |first1=Liz |title=Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the Harlem Children Society |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/resolutions/2015/j2958 |website=The New York State Senate |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
HCS as of the 2013 serves about 60 students from over 15 schools doing hands-on science research with over 20 mentors in more than 10 reputed institutions. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Program has three components: Students and research projects; seminars and training; and local, regional and national professional conferences and community science street fairs.  Family involvement and post-program follow-up provide students with support to plan their futures and mediate the transitions----academic, emotional, and social----to college and post-academic pursuits. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Depending on their interests and availability of recruited mentors, students are matched with a mentor willing to commit to the summer program.  These students enter the program at the beginning of the summer with an orientation, and spend about eight 25-hour weeks starting their research and some receive training in lab techniques and safety.  During the academic year, a fraction of the participating students put in 12–24 hours each month at their internship sites and attend weekly seminars when made available. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A fraction of the students stay committed to the program for at least two years, and are requested to work as part of HCS staff by Bhattacharya as volunteer interns with an unfixed stipend every year. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Highlights==
The Harlem Children Society has had a number of accomplishments:

*Almost 80% of the program's participants in 2006 were first or second generation immigrants to the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HCS Statistics|url=http://harlemchildrensociety.org/statistics.html|publisher=HCS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=http://harlemchildrensociety.org generates an 'account suspended' error page.|date=November 2018}}
*As of 2009, 100% of the US students enrolled in HCS internships attended college.  Of those, over 20% went to Ivy League schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Taking Note: Harlem Children Society International|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24144384|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=76|issue=1|pages=72–73|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human migration''' is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location. The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title=  Migrations country wise|accessdate=7 June 2014}}. One of the major migration rushes took place in the gold run in 19th century in California, Australia, and Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who moves from their home to another place because of natural disaster or civil disturbance may be described as a [[refugee]] or, especially within the same country, a [[displaced person]]. A person seeking refuge from political, religious, or other forms of persecution is usually described as an [[asylum seeker]].

[[Nomad]]ic movements are normally not regarded as migrations as there is no intention to settle in the new place and because the movement is generally [[Seasonal human migration|seasonal]]. Only a few nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Also, the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places.

[[File:Migrants in the world 1960-2015-en.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The number of migrants in the world 1960–2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{webbrefSV|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.TOTL|titel=International migrant stock, total|verk=The World Bank Data|hämtdatum=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many estimates of statistics in worldwide migration patterns exist.

The [[World Bank]] has published its ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' annually since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organisation for Migration]] (IOM) has published a yearly ''World Migration Report'' since 1999. The [[United Nations Statistics Division]] also keeps a database on worldwide migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/wallchart2013.htm | title=United Nations Population Division &amp;#124; Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in research on migration via the Internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oiarzabal | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Reips | first2 = U.-D. | year = 2012 | title = Migration and diaspora in the age of information and communication technologies | url = | journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1333–1338 | doi = 10.1080/1369183X.2012.698202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reips, U.-D., &amp; Buffardi, L. (2012). Studying migrants with the help of the Internet: Methods from psychology, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 38(9), 1405–1424. doi:10.1080/1369183X.2012.698208 http://www.uni-konstanz.de/iscience/reips/pubs/papers/2012ReipsBuffardi_JEMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial internal migration can also take place within a country, either [[seasonal human migration]] (mainly related to agriculture and to tourism to urban places), or shifts of population into cities ([[urbanisation]]) or out of cities ([[suburbanisation]]). Studies of worldwide migration patterns, however, tend to limit their scope to [[international migration]].

The World Bank's ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' of 2011 lists the following estimates for the year 2010: total number of immigrants: 215.8 million or 3.2% of world population.  In 2013, the percentage of international migrants worldwide increased by 33% with 59% of migrants targeting developed regions.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unfpa.org/resources/international-migration-2013-wall-chart|title= International Migration 2013 (wall chart) |year= 2013 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost half of these migrants are women, which is one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half century.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Women migrate alone or with their family members and community. Even though female migration is largely viewed as associations rather than independent migration, emerging studies argue complex and manifold reasons for this.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, M. (2008). Series Introduction in Palriwala and Uberoi (Eds.), Women and Migration in Asia (p. 359). New Delhi: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-3675-6}} (Pb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often{{quantify|date=September 2015}} a distinction is made {{by whom|date=September 2015}} between voluntary and involuntary migration, or between [[refugee]]s fleeing political conflict or natural disaster vs. economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]], but these distinctions are difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated. The World Bank's report estimates that, as of 2010, 16.3 million or 7.6% of migrants qualified as refugees. At the end of 2012, approximately 15.4 million people were refugees and persons in refugee-like situations - 87% of them found asylum in developing countries.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

Structurally, there is substantial South-South and North-North migration, i.e., most emigrants from high-income O.E.C.D. countries migrate to other high-income countries, and a substantial part (estimated at 43%) of emigrants from developing countries migrate to other developing countries. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that "[while the North has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000 (32 million) compared to the South (25 million), the South recorded a higher growth rate.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2013 the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in the developing regions (2.3%) slightly exceeded that of the developed regions (2.1%).&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

==Forced Migration==


The Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM), launched in 2003, published a report in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The 90-page report, along with supporting evidence, is available on the GCIM website [http://www.gcim.org gcim.org]&lt;/ref&gt; International migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the [[Global Forum on Migration and Development]] and the [[Global Migration Group]], both established in 2006.

The United Nations reported that 2014 had the highest level of forced migration on record: 59.5 million individuals, caused by "persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations", as compared with 51.2 million in 2013 (an increase of 8.3 million) and with 37.5 million a decade prior. {{As of | 2015}} one of every 122 humans is a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Worldwide displacement hits all-time high as war and persecution increase |url = http://www.unhcr.org/558193896.html |accessdate = 2015-09-21 |first = United Nations High Commissioner for |last = Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] has published 5 maps showing human migrations in progress in 2015 based on the UN report.&lt;ref&gt;

==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==

===Overview===

Numerous causes impel migrants to move to another country. For instance, [[globalization]] has increased the demand for workers in order to sustain national economies. Thus one category of [[economic migrant]]s - generally from impoverished developing countries - migrates to obtain sufficient income for survival.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unfpa.org/migration | title=Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such migrants often send some of their income home to family members in the form of [[remittances|economic remittances]], which have become an economic staple in a number of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jason de Parle, "A Good Provider is One Who Leaves", ''New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; People may also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict, of [[human rights violations | human-rights violations]], of violence, or to escape persecution. In 2013 it was estimated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} that around 51.2 million people fell into this category.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Other reasons people may move include to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather. This type of movement, usually from rural to urban areas, may class as [[internal migration]].&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Socio-cultural and geo-historical factors also play a major role. In North Africa, for example, emigrating Europe counts as a sign of social prestige. Moreover, many countries were former [[colony | colonies]]. This means that many have relatives who live legally in the (former) colonial [[metropole]], and who often provide important help for immigrants arriving in that metropole.&lt;ref&gt;
For example: [[Moroccans in France]], [[Filipino Americans | Filipinos in the United States of America]], [[Koreans in Japan]] or [[Samoans in New Zealand]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Relatives may help with job research and with accommodation. The geographical proximity of Africa to Europe and the long historical ties between Northern and Southern Mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Fanack|title= The Key Drivers of North African Illegal Migration to Europe|url= https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|website= Fanack.com|accessdate= 14 July 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150714172715/https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|archivedate= 14 July 2015|df= | quote = The proximity of North Africa to southern Europe, the liberal mobility policies of most European countries, and the historical links between northern and southern Mediterranean countries are all key factors encouraging people to migrate to Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of theories attempt to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"&gt;
Jennissen, R. 2007. "Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach." Population Research and Policy Review 26(4). 411 – 36.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economic theory===
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}This theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007" /&gt;

===Dual labor market theory===

Dual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===New economics of labor migration===

This theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt; Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers’ ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration'', April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation'', November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative deprivation theory===

Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===World systems theory===

[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===

Old migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants" draft paper présented in the international conference on “Crossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development”, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco – March 2–4, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper&lt;/ref&gt; studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration" Revue Algérienne d’Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N°: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration&lt;/ref&gt; explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].

==Sociological and Political Science theories==

===Sociology===
{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level; [[social conflict theory]] examines migration through the prism of competition for power and resources; [[structural functionalism]], based on the ideas of [[Émile Durkheim]], examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie|despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s.

More recently, as attention shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sBJTOhDpauQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=schiller+basch#v=onepage&amp;q=schiller%20basch&amp;f=false|title=Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States|last=Basch|first=Linda|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|last3=Blanc|first3=Christina Szanton|date=2005-09-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135307035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, work on social remittances by [[Peggy Levitt]] and others has led to a stronger conceptualisation of how migrants affect socio-political processes in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|date=1998|title=Social Remittances: Migration Driven Local-Level Forms of Cultural Diffusion|jstor=2547666|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=32|issue=4|pages=926–948|doi=10.2307/2547666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Science===
Political scientists have put forth a number of theoretical frameworks on migration, offering different perspectives on processes of [[International security|security]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Faist|first=Thomas|date=2006|pages=103–119|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781403984678_6|isbn=9781349532650|title=Migration, Citizenship, Ethnos|chapter=The Migration-Security Nexus: International Migration and Security Before and After 9/11|hdl=2043/686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamson|first=Fiona B.|date=July 2006|title=Crossing Borders: International Migration and National Security|journal=International Security|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–199|doi=10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.165|issn=0162-2889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[citizenship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-citizenship-9780198805854?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship|date=2017-08-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198805854|editor-last=Shachar|editor-first=Ayelet|series=Oxford Handbooks in Law|location=Oxford, New York|editor-last2=Bauboeck|editor-first2=Rainer|editor-last3=Bloemraad|editor-first3=Irene|editor-last4=Vink|editor-first4=Maarten}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wERHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration|title=Migration Theory: Talking across Disciplines|last=Brettell|first=Caroline B.|last2=Hollifield|first2=James F.|date=2014-08-25|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317805984|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political importance of [[diaspora]]s has also become a growing field of interest, as scholars examine questions of diaspora [[activism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2006-02-23|title=Towards a Political Theory of Migrant Transnationalism|journal=International Migration Review|volume=37|issue=3|pages=700–723|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00155.x|issn=0197-9183}}&lt;/ref&gt; state-diaspora relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Délano|first=Alexandra|last2=Gamlen|first2=Alan|date=July 2014|title=Comparing and theorizing state–diaspora relations|journal=Political Geography|volume=41|pages=43–53|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.05.005|issn=0962-6298|hdl=2440/102448}}&lt;/ref&gt; out-of-country [[voting]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lafleur|first=Jean-Michel|date=2014|title=The enfranchisement of citizens abroad: variations and explanations|journal=Democratization|volume=22 |issue=5|pages=840–860|doi=10.1080/13510347.2014.979163|url=https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/181007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states' [[soft power]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2018|title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=39 |issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1177/0192512118759902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, the majority of work has focused on immigration politics, viewing migration from the perspective of the country of destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oec_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration#v=onepage&amp;q=Oxford%20handbook%20citizenship%20migration&amp;f=false|title=Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective, Third Edition|last=Hollifield|first=James|last2=Martin|first2=Philip L.|last3=Orrenius|first3=Pia|date=2014-07-30|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804787352|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[emigration]] processes, political scientists have expanded on [[Albert O.

==Historical theories==

===Ravenstein===
Certain laws of [[social sciences|social science]] have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834–1913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:

# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''
# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.
# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.
# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.
# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.
# ''most migrants are adults.
# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.
# ''migration stage by stage.
# ''urban rural difference.
# ''migration and technology.
# ''economic condition.

===Lee===
Lee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|author= Everett S. Lee|year= 1966|publisher= University of Pennsylvania|volume=3|pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large. (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–99)

===Climate cycles===
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in [[Climate change|climatic cycles]], which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially [[Mongolia]] and to its west the [[Altai mountains|Altai]]. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term "migratory domino effect" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Université de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other models===
* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''&lt;ref&gt;Idyorough, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13126">In the context of an evolving [[information society]], the term '''information ecology''' marks a connection between [[ecology|ecological]] ideas with the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment and has been gaining acceptance in a growing number of disciplines. "Information ecology" often is used as [[metaphor]], viewing the informational space as an [[ecosystem]].

Information ecology is a science which studies the laws governing the influence of information summary on the formation and functioning of [[biosystem]]s, including that of individuals, human [[communities]] and humanity in general and on the health and psychological, physical and social well-being of the human being; and which undertakes to develop methodologies to improve the information environment {{Harv|Eryomin|1998}}.

Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of [[collective intelligence]] and [[knowledge ecology]] {{Harv|Pór|2000}}.  Eddy et. al. (2014) use information ecology for science-policy integration in ecosystems-based management (EBM).

==Language of ecology==
Information ecology draws on the language of ecology - [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[species]], [[evolution]], [[ecosystem]], [[ecological niche|niche]], growth, equilibrium, etc. - to describe and analyze [[information systems]] from a perspective that considers the distribution and abundance of [[organism]]s, their relationships with each other, and how they influence and are influenced by their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The virtual lack of boundaries between information systems and the impact of [[information technology]] on economic, social and environmental activities frequently calls on an [[information ecologist]] to consider local information ecosystems in the context of larger systems, and of the evolution of global information ecosystems. See also [[list of ecology topics]].

== Networked information economy ==

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked [[information economy]] that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful [[peer production]] processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example.

[[Bonnie Nardi]] and [[Vicki O'Day]] in their book "Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart,"  {{Harv|Nardi|O’Day|1999}} apply the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system.

== In different domains / disciplines ==

=== Anthropology ===
Nardi and O’Day’s book represents the first specific treatment of information ecology by anthropologists. H.E. Kuchka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/information-ecology|title=Information Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; situates information within socially-distributed cognition of cultural systems. Casagrande and Peters&lt;ref&gt;Casagrande, D.G., &amp; C. Peters. 2013. Ecomyopia meets the longue durée: An information ecology of the increasingly arid Southwestern United States. Pp. 97-144 in H. Kopnina &amp; E. Shoreman (Eds.), Environmental Anthropology: Future Directions. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; use information ecology for an anthropological critique of Southwest US water policy. Stepp (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuchka.org/sites/default/files/stepp.pdf |title=Data |website=kuchka.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a prospectus for the anthropological study of information ecology.

=== Knowledge management ===
Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak {{Harv|Davenport|Prusak|1997}}, with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at [[Distributed Systems Technology Centre|DSTC]] called ''Information ecology'', concerned with distributed information systems and online communities.

=== Law ===
Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.
NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology&lt;ref&gt;
Conference [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html A Free Information Ecology in the Digital Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329043908/http://www.law.nyu.edu/ili/conferences/freeinfo2000/aboutconf/index.html |date=2009-03-29 }}, New York University School of Law, March 31, 2000 to Sunday, April 2, 2000
&lt;/ref&gt;  and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School's [[Center for the Study of the Public Domain]].

=== Library science ===
The field of [[library science]] has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Nardi and O'Day as a "keystone species in information ecology",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307005156/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |accessdate=April 2, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502182859/http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html |archivedate=May 2, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307010141/http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT |archive-date=2006-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to children's library database administrator in Russia.

=== Biology ===
There has also been increasing use of "information ecology" as a concept among ecologists involved in digital mapping of botanical resources, including research by Zhang Xinshi at the Institute of Botany of the China Academy of Science; also see a presentation to the Information Ecology SIG at Yale University's Forestry School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/dpu-pip/ien-iie.ppt]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Ecology ===
From the analysis of specific examples of the nature and physiology are determined 10 axioms and laws of information ecology, which serves as the basis for creating information strategies and tactics in social, economic, political and other spheres that affect [[human health]] and human communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291074682_Eryomin_AL_Nature_and_Physiology_of_the_Informational_Human_Ecology_Ecology_of_Human_-_2000_-_No2_-_P55-60_Eremin_AL_Priroda_i_fiziologia_informacionnoj_ekologii_celoveka_Ekologia_celoveka_-_2000_-_No|title=Eryomin A.L.

=== Science-Policy Integration (SPI) / Ecosystems-Based Management (EBM) ===
Eddy et. al. (2014) use principles of information ecology to develop a framework for integrating scientific information in decision-making in ecosystem-based management (EBM).  Using a metaphor of how a species adapts to environmental changes through information processing, they developed a 3-tiered model that differentiates primary, secondary and tertiary levels of information processing, within both the technical and human domains.

[[Image:IByME.jpg|150px|thumb|Official logo of IByME.]]
The '''Experimental Medicine and Biology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental}}, IByME) is a [[research and development]] centre affiliated to the [[University of Buenos Aires]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==History==
The institute was privately founded on March 14, 1944 by Dr. [[Bernardo A. Houssay]], [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] and [[Medicine]] (1947) for his work in [[diabetes]] and the control of the [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]]. Drs. [[Eduardo Braun-Menéndez]], [[Oscar Orías]], [[Juan T. Lewis]] and [[Virgilio G. Foglia]] were co-founders. The founding of the Institute was motivated by the dismissal of Dr. Houssay, together with 150 other professors from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], by the military government. Dr. Houssay became its director and brought to work with him several colleagues and students. The initiative was made possible by the support of Dr. [[Miguel F. Laphitzondo]] and others who granted financial contributions in memory of [[Juan B. Sauberán]].

The institute was the first organization devoted to [[scientific research]] in Argentina.  Its initial structure resembled that of the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] (now [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States) and of the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France. In 1949, the Institute was established as a [[charter]]ed [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] recognized by the National Bureau of Non-Profit Entitites (''Registro Nacional de Entidades de Bien Público'').

Later on, several Houssay’s disciples left the Institute to settle research groups in many Argentine and other [[Latin American]] universities. Many research laboratories were founded following the model of Houssay’s Institute. For example, Dr. [[Miguel Rolando Covian]] chaired the Department of Physiology of the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto]] of the [[University of São Paulo]] from 1952 to 1986, giving origin to a large scientific group in [[Brazil]].

On January 16, 1959, Eduardo Braun Menéndez, who played an outstanding role in the life of the Institute, died. His vacancy in the Board of Directors was filled by Dr. [[Luis F. Leloir]] who would later receive the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] (1970).

After Dr. Houssay and others were reintegrated into the University of Buenos Aires, in 1959, the Institute was affiliated to this University, remaining so until today. Dr. Bernardo Houssay was the director of the Institute until his death in 1971. Thereupon, an Administrative Commission led by Prof. Dr. Virgilio Foglia, assisted by Dr. Julia V. Uranga and Dr. Luis F. Leloir, undertook the Institute's affairs. The Institute established legal associations with the [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]].

The death of Prof. Dr. Luis F. Leloir, in December 1987, and the growth of the Institute prompted the need of increasing the number of members in the Administrative Commission. Accordingly, the necessary changes in the Institute Bylaws were submitted to the National Bureau of Legal Entitites (''Dirección General de Personas Jurídicas'') for approval. While the new Bylaws were under consideration, Drs. Alberto Baldi, Jorge Blaquier, Ricardo Calandra, Eduardo Charreau, Alejandro De Nicola, Enrique Segura, Alicia Roldán, Enrique del Castillo, Carlos Libertun, and Marta Tesone collaborated with Dr. Virgilio G. Foglia and Dr. Uranga in the administration of the Institute.

On July 12, 1993, the Institute was given the status of a Unit of Technological Transfer by the Argentinian Secretary of Science and Technology. This enabled the participation of technological and scientific sectors as consultants to productive sectors, public or private, both in the selection and adaptation of available technology and in the transfer of results derived from research.

==Activities==

The interests of the Institute can be grouped into three categories: 
* Basic and applied investigations in [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]];
* Training of students and pre- and postdoctoral fellows; and
* Organization of courses at pre- and post-graduate levels.

The Institute is the site for the Argentine Committee of the Postdoctoral Program of selection of postdoctoral research fellowships in the area of Biomedical Sciences granted by [[John E. Fogarty International Center]] from the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]]; such Committee being chaired by Dr. Eduardo Charreau.

Historically, the main discoveries were in the fields of [[endocrinology]] and physiology.  The current research areas are wider and include [[Neurosciences]], [[Biology of Reproduction]], Experimental [[Oncology]] and [[Immunology]].  Results are published in journals of international recognition, thus demonstrating the level of excellence reached by the different research groups.

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

An '''invocation''' (from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] ''invocare'' "to call on, invoke, to give") may take the form of:
[[File:Gustave dore crusades invocation to muhammad.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Invocation'' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

*[[Supplication]], [[prayer]] or [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]].
*A form of [[Spirit possession|possession]].
*[[wikt:command|Command]] or [[conjuration]].
*[[Self-identification]] with certain spirits.

These forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. 
See also [[Theurgy]].

== Supplication or prayer ==
As a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon [[God]], a god, [[goddess]], or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for [[worship]], this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the [[Lord's Prayer]].

All religions in general use invoking prayers, [[liturgies]], or [[hymns]]; see for example the [[mantra]]s in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Egypt]]ian ''Coming Out by Day'' (aka ''[[Book of the Dead]]''), the [[Orphic]] Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] characters on clay tablets, addressed to [[Shamash]], [[Ishtar]], and other deities.

=== As alternative to prayer ===
An invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=19423373|title = Atheist Delivers Invocation At Tulsa City Council Meeting For First Time Ever|date = Aug 30, 2012&lt;!-- 9:27 PM EDT--&gt;|publisher = KOTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in [[South Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2938|title = Andrew Lovley's Secular Invocation|publisher = Secular Students Alliance|date = 2009-12-15 &lt;!-- - 10:08 --&gt; |author = Lyz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this usage, it is comparable to an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking [[oath]]s of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or [[non-belief]].

== A form of possession ==
The word "possession" is used here in its neutral form to mean "a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'.  This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with [[demonic possession]].

In some religious traditions including [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Wicca]], "invocation" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from "[[evocation]]", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, [[Aleister Crowley]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To "invoke" is to "call in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth". This is the essential difference between the two branches of [[Magic (paranormal)|Magick]]. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the [[consciousness]]. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]], ''Magick, Book 4'', p.147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a [[religious vision]]). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the [[ritual]] of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].

The ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to [[loa]] possession in the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] tradition where devotees are described as being "ridden" or "mounted" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] journalist [[Carol Beckwith]] described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Beckwith |title=The African Roots of Voodoo |publisher= National Geographic 188.2 |date=August 1995 |pages=102–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where [[Odin]] is invoked to "ride" workers of [[seidr]] (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].  Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J Wallis]], ''Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans'', p.96 {{ISBN|0-415-30202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Command or conjuration ==
{{main|Conjuration}}
Some have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities.  These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.

The following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in [[cuneiform]] on a statue of the Assyrian [[demon]] [[Pazuzu]].  Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective [[amulet]] with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.{{citation needed|reason=this is a potentially dangerous invocation, and its true purpose should be verified|date=March 2010}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is found in the book [[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]] during the Conjuration of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt,
Nor do I cook the honey with the wine,
I bake the body and the blood and soul,
The soul of (great) Diana, that she shall
Know neither rest nor peace, and ever be
In cruel suffering till she will grant
What I request, what I do most desire,
I beg it of her from my very heart!
And if the grace be granted, O Diana!
In honour of thee I will hold this feast,
Feast and drain the goblet deep,
We will dance and wildly leap,
And if thou grant'st the grace which I require,
Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps
Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Self-identification with certain spirits ==
Invocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of [[Aphrodite]] or the ferocity of [[Kali]]. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an [[archetype]]) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories.  See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the [[Songs of Bilitis]], first attributed to a contemporary of [[Sappho]] (but actually written by [[Pierre Louÿs]] in the 1890s):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, [[Astarte]]! 
Oh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! 
Thou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. 
Oh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!&lt;ref&gt;From the Songs of Bilitis&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Istishab''' ({{lang-ar|استصحاب}} {{lang-en|'''continuity'''|italic=yes}}) is an [[Islamic term]] used in the [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] to denote the principle of the presumption of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1138 |title=Istishab - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com |language=en |quote=Islamic legal term for the presumption of continuity, where a situation existing previously is presumed to be continuing at present until the contrary is proven. |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from an [[Arabic]] word ''suhbah'' meaning accompany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-en/%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B5%25D8%25AD%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A8/ |title= ترجمة و معنى استصحاب في قاموس عربي انجليزي|trans-title = Meaning of Istishab in English Arabic Almaany Dictionary |last=Team |first=Almaany |website=www.almaany.com |language=en |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the fundamental principles of the [[Ijtihad|legal deduction]] that presumes the continuation of a fact. It is based on [[probability]] and can be applied in the absence of other proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=wRlI0nJp5mEC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=Istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t_ecLTachv&amp;sig=OjAdj3A7UPGaO9xEYoZbe136ggs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC_f734eXXAhWDWBQKHXYoCz84ChDoAQheMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab&amp;f=false |title=Theory and Practice of Modern Islamic Finance: The Case Analysis from Australia |last=Ahmad |first=Abu Umar Faruq |date=2010 |publisher=Universal-Publishers |isbn=9781599425177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istishab, an initiative of [[ash-Shafii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=WZ5WDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=shafii+employed+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-zl6bHuU4I&amp;sig=A7h3bkME4UOx9COKq8xwvNBn31k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjogpuhg-bXAhVKQBQKHXewD7kQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=shafii%2520employed%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Understanding Islamic Theology |last=Sookhdeo |first=Patrick |date=2014-06-30 |publisher=BookBaby |isbn=9780989290548 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the rationalistic principle of extracting a [[Hukm|legal solution]] according to which changes are not considered to occur until clear signs of these changes are apparent. It serves as the basis for many legal rulings such as the presumption of innocence—the person is regarded as innocent unless proven guilty. [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[ash-Shafii]] regarded it to be a proof until it is contradicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=bKveCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=Presumption+of+existence+before+evidence+is+available+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dJv1PM-kVR&amp;sig=oQCji2_JvXa0FmiDsklBrgrtAeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY58uTh-bXAhXKuRQKHeoxAtsQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520existence%2520before%2520evidence%2520is%2520available%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Shari’a Law in Commercial and Banking Arbitration: Law and Practice in Saudi Arabia |last=Baamir |first=Abdulrahman Yahya |date=2016-04-01 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317055624 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several classical jurists differed over this principle with some [[Hanafi]] jurists refusing to regard it as an evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54049210 |title=Mabānī-i istinbāṭ-i ḥuqūq-i Islāmī, yā, Uṣūl-i fiqh |last=al-Ḥasan. |first=Muḥammadī, Abū |date=2002 |publisher=Muʼassasah-ʼi Intishārāt va Chāp-i Dānishgāh-i Tihrān |isbn=9640340766 |edition=Chāp-i 14 |location=Tihrān |oclc=54049210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Istishab+abu+hanifa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8eqMGV&amp;sig=DKwHLoPW9esAFbjQ3PWfHclrRQI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT5YOetubXAhVGSBQKHddgBh4Q6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Istishab%2520abu%2520hanifa&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely employed by the contemporaries scholars with the exception of  [[Hanbali]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=tyHaHZcRLWEC&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=istishab+hanafi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3dqGgUcezs&amp;sig=mCSaE4cD1GKWtI3yPf1Cv5mtQX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW96KG6eXXAhUKbxQKHUUeD70Q6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=istishab%2520hanafi&amp;f=false |title=Shari'ah Law: An Introduction |last=Kamali |first=Mohammad Hashim |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |isbn=9781780740379 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smahate.com/islamic-classes/2013-winter/al-qawaaid-al-fiqhiyyah |title=Al Qawaaid al Fiqhiyyah - Shakeel Mahate |website=www.smahate.com |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

[[Ibn al-Qayyim]] defined it as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iium.edu.my/deed/lawbase/maliki_fiqh/usul9.html |title=The Eighth Principle: The Principle of Istishab (Presumption of Continuity) |website=www.iium.edu.my |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The continuation of what is established or the negation of what does not exist, i.e. it is the judgement, negative or positive, continues until there is evidence of a change of state. This continuance is not proved by positive evidence, but by the absence of the existence of new evidence.}}

[[Al-Qarafi]] expressed it as the validity of the former state in the following words. {{quote|Istishab means the belief that the past or present matter must be assumed to remain as it is in the present or future.}}

== Types ==
Istishab is divided into several types. The majority of the scholars agree upon three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=2zZVZN7AOG0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=types+of+istishab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2OAoLnwWkl&amp;sig=6N9mEUh9jDANkaq1f-n8oFZmRoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB2K-n9uXXAhVIshQKHX2zAuMQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=types%2520of%2520istishab&amp;f=false |title=Inevitable Doubt: Two Theories of Shīʻī Jurisprudence |last=Gleave |first=Robert |date=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004115951 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presumption of the original absence ===
It is the absence of any [[Shariah]] norms on an adult Muslim, until their legitimacy is established. An example is the absence of the mandatory sixth [[Salah|prayer]] for a Muslim, the resumption of the person's innocence in a crime, etc. Islamic theologians are [[Ijma|unanimous]] regarding the validity of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=kX1yDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=Presumption+of+the+original+absence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5BLE8dnNLV&amp;sig=8MtdQRW2nRXD28cwd9NJ0oz424A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCouiuhubXAhWBbRQKHa5fBx4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Presumption%2520of%2520the%2520original%2520absence&amp;f=false |title=Foundations of Jurisprudence - An Introduction to Imāmī Shīʿī Legal Theory: Mabādiʾ al-wuṣūl ilā ʿilm al-uṣūl |last=al-Ḥillī |first=al-ʿAllāmah |date=2016-11-10 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004311770 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basis in everyday life is permissiveness ===
The overwhelming majority of jurists believe that the basis in useful everyday things is [[halal|permissiveness]] and in harmful things is [[Haram|prohibition]]. For example, a certain type of food is allowed until a Sharia argument is established, proving its prohibition.

=== Presumption of existence before evidence is available ===
If there are Sharia texts with respect to any norm, backed up by the Istishab, then statements about the abolition of this rule will not be accepted until they are backed up by evidence. An example is the continued ownership of property rights. The application to terminate property will not be accepted until evidence is submitted supporting these statements. Another example is the validity of the [[Wudu|ablution]], which will not invalidated on the mere basis of doubt.

[[File:PSM V31 D010 James Fergusson.png|thumb|James Fergusson]]
'''James Fergusson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 January 1808&amp;nbsp;– 9 January 1886) was a Scottish architectural historian, mainly remembered for his interest in Indian historical architecture and antiquities. He was an important figure in the 19th century rediscovery of ancient India. He was originally a businessman, and though not formally trained as an architect, designed some buildings and decorative schemes.

==Life==
Fergusson was born at [[Ayr]], the son of [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]] (1773–1846) an army surgeon. After being educated first at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, and then at a private school in [[Hounslow]], he went to [[Calcutta]] as a partner in a mercantile house. Here he became interested in the remains of the ancient architecture of India, little known or understood at that time.  The successful conduct of an [[indigo]] factory, as he states in his own account, enabled him to retire from business after about ten years and settle in London. His observations on [[Indian architecture]] were first published in his book on ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

The task of analysing the historic and [[aesthetic]] relations of this type of ancient buildings led him further to undertake a historical and critical comparative survey of the whole subject of architecture in ''The Illustrated Handbook of Architecture, being a Concise and Popular Account of the different Styles of Architecture prevailing in all Ages and Countries'', a work which first appeared in 1855 in two volumes. It was followed in 1862 by one entitled ''A History of the Modern Styles of Architecture'', being a sequel to the ''Handbook of Architecture''.

The 1855 work was reissued ten years later in a much more extended form in three volumes, under the title of ''A History of Architecture in all Countries from the Earliest Times to the Present Day.''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}
[[File:James Ferguson architect.jpg|thumb|left]]
The chapters on [[Indian architecture]], which had been considered at rather disproportionate length in the Handbook, were removed from the general History, and the whole of this subject treated more fully in a separate volume, ''The History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'', which appeared in 1876, as the fourth volume to ''The History of Architecture''. The 1876 work was later revised with additions by James Burgess and [[Richard Phené Spiers]] in 1910 and published in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dames|first=M. Longworth|title=''History of Indian and Eastern Architecture'' by James Fergusson; James Burgess; R. Phené Spiers|journal=[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|date=April 1913|pages=470–474|jstor=25189005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was the first clearly to point out and characterise the essential difference between this and the spontaneously evolved architecture of preceding ages. His 1849 ''Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture'' is a most thoughtful metaphysical study. Some of his essays on special points in archaeology, such as the treatise on ''The Mode in which Light was introduced into Greek Temples'', included theories on [[Greek temple]]s which have not received general acceptance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Like many of his contemporaries, Fergusson was concerned about British preparedness to resist a French invasion and he published ''An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences'' (1849), ''The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts'' (1852) and ''Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth'' (1856). In 1859, he was the only civilian appointed to the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswami Iyengar, Professor M S and others (1922), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yQv_AkyG_wC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22james+fergusson%22+portsmouth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=soU6VcWiAoLoaMXEgOAL&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22james%20fergusson%22%20portsmouth&amp;f=false ''Eminent Orientalists: Indian, European, American''], G A Natesan &amp; Co, Madras (pp. 87–88)&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently recommended a huge programme of coastal fortifications that became known as "[[Palmerston's Follies]]".

He received the gold medal of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1871. Among his works, besides those already mentioned, are: ''Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored'' (1851), ''Mausoleum at Halicarnassus restored'' (1862), ''Tree and Serpent Worship'' (1868), ''Rude Stone Monuments in all Countries'' (1872), and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'' (1878). The sessional papers of the [[Institute of British Architects]] include papers by him on ''The History of the Pointed Arch'', ''Architecture of Southern India'', ''Architectural Splendour of the City of Beeja pore'', on the ''Erechtheum'' and on the ''Temple of Diana at Ephesus''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Although not a prolific practising architect, a small number of examples of Fergusson's architecture remain in existence, the most notable of which are the parliament building of [[Jamaica]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the [[Marianne North]] Gallery in [[Kew Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |origyear=2002 |date=30 November 2004 |title=The Marianne North Gallery |url=http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |publisher=Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120132610/http://www.kew.org/heritage/places/mariannenorth.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergusson was adviser with [[Austen Henry Layard]] in the scheme of decoration for the [[Assyria]]n court at [[The Crystal Palace]], and in 1856 assumed the duties of general manager to the Crystal Palace Company, a post which he held for two years. In 1866 he was a member of a committee to advise Henry Scott on design aspects of the [[Royal Albert Hall]], along with architects [[William Tite]] and [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]], and the engineers [[John Hawkshaw]] and [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

In 1847 Fergusson published an Essay on the ''Ancient Topography of Jerusalem'', in which he contended that the [[Mosque of Omar]] was the identical church built by [[Constantine the Great]] over the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and that it, and not the present church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], was the genuine burial-place of Jesus. The burden of this contention was further explained by the publication in 1860 of his ''Notes on the Site of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem''; and ''The Temples of the Jews and the other Buildings in the Haram Area at Jerusalem'', published in 1878, which was a further elaboration of these theories, which are said to have been the origin of the establishment of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

Fergusson died in London on 9 January 1886.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=273}}

He was a member of the doctoral faculty at the Graduate School and University Center of the [[City University of New York]] (GSUC).

He is the author of ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' (1978) and ''The Ordeal of Civility: Freud, Marx, Lévi-Strauss and the Jewish Struggle with Modernity'' (1974), two books in the [[sociology of religion]]. Cuddihy has been described as a "Catholic atheist,", and "a brilliant yet eccentric critic of contemporary American Jewry".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Berenbaum, ''After Tragedy and Triumph: Essays in Modern Jewish Thought and the American Experience'' (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Cuddihy received his bachelor's degree from St. John's College ([[Annapolis]]), three M.A.s: two from [[Columbia University]] and a third from the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/socio/faculty/cuddi.html Biography] at the [[Hunter College]] Department of Sociology website.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a Ph.D. in Sociology at [[Rutgers University]].

He taught courses in sociological theory, sociology of religion, and the sociology of diaspora Jewry.

== Works ==
His doctoral dissertation was later published, in 1974, as ''The Ordeal of Civility''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moma.org/research/archives/EAD/Motherwellb.html Robert Motherwell Scrapbooks in The Museum of Modern Art Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' was published in 1978.

In ''The Ordeal of Civility'', Cuddihy explicates the wrenching process of adjusting to [[modernity]] experienced by the [[shtetl]] [[Jews]] of the [[Pale of Settlement|Pale]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who had to adapt quickly from a [[tribal]] culture to a modern [[Protestant]] civil culture rather than slowly adjusting over the centuries. It is in this context that he locates the efforts of Jewish intellectuals, such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to facilitate the transition by providing a cohesive narrative that attempts to universalize the experience and thus provide an apologia to both the in-group of Jews and the out-group of [[gentiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917261,00.html Review by Richard Bernstein NYT 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cuddihy's "The Ordeal of Civility" |author=Sander L.

Cuddihy views various intellectual critiques of modernity - both [[conservative]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] - as the product of [[resentment]] against the more successful, enlightened, Protestant majority.

The '''''Journal of Moral Theology''''' is a [[Academic journal|journal]] that publishes [[peer-reviewed]] scholarly articles in the field of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] moral [[theology]]. The journal is published [[semiannual|semi-annually]], with regular issues in January and June, that cover theological treatments of related topics in [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Articles published in the journal undergo at least two double blind peer reviews before being selected for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Moral Theology|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://digitalarchives.msmary.edu/digital/collection/JMT/id/68/rec/1 |title=Engaging Disability|accessdate=December 4, 2017|publisher=[[Mount St. Mary's University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was established by David Matzko McCarthy of [[Mount St. Mary's University]], then the Fr. James M. Forker Professor of [[Catholic Social Teaching]]. He received considerable assistance from Joshua Hochschild, who was the Mount’s Dean of the College of [[Liberal Arts]] at that time, and from David Cloutier and William Mattison III, who edited the inaugural issue (January 2012). McCarthy’s work on the journal started in early in 2009, and by the end of the year, an intrepid editorial board was formed.
 
The initial board membership was constituted by Melanie Barrett, University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary; Joseph Capizzi, The Catholic University of America; David Cloutier, The Catholic University of America; Kelly Johnson, University of Dayton; M. Therese Lysaught, Loyola University Chicago; Bryan Massingale, Fordham University; William C. Mattison III, University of Notre Dame; Jeanne Heffernan Schindler, John Paul II Institute; Christopher P. Vogt, St. John’s University. The affiliations noted are current (not 2012). David McCarthy is the Associate Provost at Mount St. Mary’s University.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, David M. ''The History of the Journal of Moral Theology.'' [[Mount St. Mary's University]].

'''Kansei engineering''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 感性工学 ''kansei kougaku'', emotional or affective engineering) aims at the development or improvement of products and services by translating the customer's [[Sensibility|psychological feelings and needs]] into the domain of product design (i.e. parameters). It was founded by [[Mitsuo Nagamachi]], Professor Emeritus of [[Hiroshima University]] (also former Dean of [[Hiroshima International University]] and CEO of [[International Kansei Design Institute]]).  Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.

It has now been adopted as one of the topics for [[professional development]] by the [[Royal Statistical Society]].

==Introduction==
{{essay-like|date=January 2018}}
Product design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened [[product lifecycle]], development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as [[brand image]], reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers has started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.

This demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as "[[emotional design]]" or "affective engineering".

== History ==

Nowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.

Methods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of [[ergonomics]] (human factor engineering ){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.

In the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. [[Charles E. Osgood]] developed his [[semantic differential]] method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and [[Yoji Akao]] developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called [[quality function deployment]] (QFD). Another method, the [[Kano model]], was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]], of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is [[Conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]]. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.

Although all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.

==Procedure ==

As mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.

According to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:
# How to accurately understand consumer Kansei
# How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design
# How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design

== A model on methodology ==

In Japanese publications{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Schütte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.

; Choice of Domain
''Domain'' in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Schütte in detail in a couple of publications.

; Span the Semantic Space
The expression ''Semantic Space'' was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called "Kansei words" or "Kansei Engineering words".

; Span the Space of Properties
The next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.
The collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.
Synthesis
In the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.

; Synthesis
The research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :

* Category Identification
* Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I
* Rough Sets Theory
* Genetic Algorithm
* Fuzzy Sets Theory

; Model building and Test of Validity
After doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.
The process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.

==Software tools==
Kansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.
In order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.
User consoles

== Software ==

As described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Linköping University in Sweden ([http://www.kanseiengineering.net www.kanseiengineering.net]). The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data

Another software package (Kn6) was developed at the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] in Spain.

Both software packages improve the collection and evalutation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[séance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
In [[Islamic]] terminology, something which is '''''makruh''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مكروه, [[transliteration|transliterated]]: '''makrooh''' or ''makrūh'') is a disliked or offensive act (literally "detestable" or "abominable"&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt;). It is one of the [[Ahkam|five categories]] (''al-ahkam al-khamsa'') in Islamic law -- ''[[wajib]]/[[fard]]'' (obligatory), ''[[Mustahabb]]/mandub'' (recommended), ''[[mubah]]'' (neutral), ''makruh'' (disapproved), ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref name=CampoEoI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=infobase|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Makruh+haram+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TEi8U_6ZGcqLyASr94KIDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20haram%20halal&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Though it is not ''[[haraam|haram]]'' (forbidden) or subject to punishment, a person who abstains from this act will be rewarded.&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt; [[Muslim]]s are encouraged to avoid such actions when or as possible. It is one of the degrees of approval (''[[ahkam]]'') in [[sharia|Islamic law]].

Examples of something considered ''Makruh'' are the use of a great amount of water for the pre-[[Salat|prayer]] [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (ritual washings) known as the ''[[wudu]]'' and ''[[ghusl]]'', the consumption of [[garlic]] before attending the mosque or socializing with others,&lt;ref name=aldin&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Dīn|first1=Mūʼil Yūsuf ʻIzz|title=Islamic Law: From Historical Foundations to Contemporary Practice|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzVVL8zI0sC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Makruh+example&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dUS8U-mvMoWHyATB04GADQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[divorce in Islam|divorce]].&lt;ref name=women-sonbol&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sonbol|editor1-first=Amira El Azhary|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLUgscG6zFYC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=Makruh+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akRWoNKBoP&amp;sig=oTDIqYZkPSSAjM96k2Adx2VhR90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q0a8U5GILNOUyASbxYK4BQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20divorce&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a food which is considered ''Makruh'' for Muslims of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab]] is [[prawns]] (but only for Hanafi Madh'hab).&lt;ref&gt;Lawful to you is the pursuit of water game and its use for food, for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel; ….[5:96]..&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, however, shared attitudes within the Hanafi school of whether shrimp are considered water game and are thereby [[halal]]. Hanafis believe that you should refrain from it and eat something else if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|title=Ruling on Shrimp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222206/http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of ''Makruh'' acts in Islam include [[Profanity|swearing]], talking while taking [[wudu]] for prayer, and slaughtering an animal for food where other animals of its kind can see.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Master of Science in Management''', abbreviated '''MSc''', '''MScM''', '''MIM''' or '''MSM''', is a [[Master of Science]] [[academic degree]]. In terms of content, it is similar to the [[MBA]] degree as it contains general management courses.

According to a [[Financial Times]] ranking, the [[University of St. Gallen]] in Switzerland, [[HEC Paris]] in France offer the best Master in Management programmes in the world in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management-2017|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|website=rankings.ft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
Graduates holding an MSc in Management have commonly studied the following subjects:
* [[Business Ethics]]
* Corporate and Business Strategy
* [[Economics]]
* [[Engineering management]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Financial Management]] and [[managerial accounting]]
* [[Human Resources Management]] and [[Organizational Behavior]]
* [[Management Information Systems]]
* Management Theory
* [[Marketing]] or [[Marketing Management]]
* [[Operations Management]] and [[Supply Chain Management]]
* [[Protected Area]] Management
* Personal student [[dissertation]] ([[thesis]])
In [[Canada]], a highly specialized MSc in Management is also quite common (ex: MSc in Management in Finance and Accounting). These degrees are meant to provide students with a highly specialized set of skills for industry or for further academic study.

==Comparison to MBA==
As is the case with the MBA degree, as the number of school granting MSc in Management degrees has grown, so has the diversity of characteristics defining these programs. In most cases, the MSc in Management is an academic degree with no or some requirements for previous job experience, while the MBA is also a professional degree for persons with minimum 2–3 years job experience or 2nd class lower division honorers. However, there are also schools where the MSM degree is granted only to managers with extensive (typically 10 years or more) of work and managerial experience. Whereas MBA programs are open to people from all academic disciplines, about one third of the MSc in Management programs worldwide require a first degree in business or economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Graf |url=http://www.mim-compass.com/content/download/4362/193346/version/9/file/Global_MIM_Study_2012_Report.pdf/ |title=Global MIM Survey 2012|publisher=Master in Management Compass |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim the MSc degree is more theory-oriented, and some programs do focus on specific skill set development for managers, while the MBA degree can be more practice-oriented and financially focused. In some schools, the MSc in Management degree studies the academic discipline of [[Management]], while the MBA degree studies the academic discipline of [[Business Administration]].  Thus, some MSc degree programs focus on research in a specialized area, while the MBA degree would place more emphasis on strategy. According to one school, "While the MBA program focuses on the practical application of management theory, the M.Sc. in Management will provide for an advanced-level conceptual foundation in a student’s chosen field, and allow for the pursuit of highly focused research through a master’s level thesis."&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bus.brocku.ca/msc/ |title=Master of Science in Management &amp;#124; Brock University |publisher=Bus.brocku.ca |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both degrees contain strong professional focus and are both very well suited for professionals wishing to improve positions in their respective industries. Most MSc in Management programs contain very directed content geared towards development of a particular set of leadership skills for the mid-career professional looking to improve their credentials. A typical degree MSc in Management can be completed in less than 2 years in an online accelerated program.&lt;ref name="MSUOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/programs/masters-degree/ms-management-strategy-leadership/ |title=Master of Science in Management, Strategy and Leadership |publisher=MSUOnline.com |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, some can be "completed 100% online in as few as 12 months."&lt;ref name="SBU Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.sbu.edu/programs/master/msl |title=M.A. Strategic Leadership |publisher=online.sbu.edu |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons admitted to the degree of MSc in Management are entitled to add the designation ''MSc'' or MSM after their names (e.g. Domeng Gomez MSc), while those holding an MBA can add the designation ''MBA'' (e.g. Domeng Gomez MBA). 
While the MBA degree was started in the [[United States]], the MSc in Management degree is of [[Europe]]an origin. There seems to be a tendency that the demand for MBA is saturated whereas the demand for Masters in Management is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormack |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/special-attention-the-rising-demand-for-masters-in-management-courses-2142804.html |title=Special attention: The rising demand for Masters in management courses - Higher - Education |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Glatze was born in [[Olympia, Washington|Tacoma, Washington.]] His mother was a non-denominational Christian and his father was [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=narthinterview&gt;Nicolos, Joseph. {{citation |url=http://narth.com/docs/glatze.pdf |title=Interview with Michael Glatze |accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died of a heart condition when Glatze was 13, and his mother died when he was 19.&lt;ref name=xtianpost&gt;{{citation |title=Leading Gay Rights Activist Comes Out of Homosexuality, Tells His Story |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070705/28312_Leading_Gay_Rights_Activist_Comes_Out_of_Homosexuality,_Tells_His_Story.htm|periodical=[[The Christian Post]] |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glatze earned a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Dartmouth College]] where he majored in [[English literature]] and [[creative writing]], with a minor in music.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

While working at ''[[XY Magazine]]'' in San Francisco, Glatze met Benjie Nycum. Glatze and Nycum coauthored the book ''XY Survival Guide'' (2000).&lt;ref name=xysurvival&gt;{{citation |title=XY Survival Guide |first=Benjie |last=Nycum |first2=Michael |last2=Glatze |isbn=978-0-9703213-4-3 |publisher=X Y Pub |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later co-founded their own magazine, ''[[YGA (magazine)|Young Gay America]]''.&lt;ref name=time2005/&gt;

In 2003, Glatze starred in ''[[Jim in Bold]]'', an LGBT-related film, with his partner Benjie.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370809/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Glatze was quoted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine saying "I don't think the gay movement understands the extent to which the next generation just wants to be normal kids. The people who are getting that are the Christian right."&lt;ref name=time2005&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1112856-1,00.html |title=The Battle Over Gay Teens |first=John |last=Cloud |periodical=Time Magazine |date=October 2, 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[analytic philosophy]], the term '''natural kind''' identifies a grouping of singular objects that always share particular qualities, whether or not humans know either the objects or the qualities.  A natural kind labels a "real" structure in the natural world, not an artificial result of human reasoning, by which scholars try to explain common sense knowledge with scientific knowledge.

Those who believe in natural kinds debate their structure and how it can be known.  The structure of kinds is assumed to be stable despite worldly experience of constant flux.  According to tradition, natural kinds can be known in two forms: as knowledge of general ideas about kinds, acquired by [[deductive reasoning]], and as knowledge of observable examples of kinds, known by [[inductive reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Dew38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: The Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|date=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419–20}}

Results of deductive and inductive reasoning are stated in [[propositions]] that express relations among objects and their qualities.  For example: "All water is &lt;math&gt;H_2 O&lt;/math&gt;." "All men are mortal." "All crows are black."

Believers in natural kinds claim such propositions describe objects and related qualities that exist.  But they recognize that inductive propositions about "all" of a kind are problematic, because no-one can observe "all" of anything.  Drawing conclusions about all members of a kind after observing a small sample appears illogical.  But this kind of reasoning appears to be necessary, and often "works," meaning proves to be able to identify stable kinds.

Scientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study into ''kinds'' and theorize about those kinds.  To say that a kind is ''natural'' is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests and actions of human beings.  We tend to assume that science is often successful in revealing these kinds; it is a [[corollary]] of [[scientific realism]] that when all goes well the [[Categorization|classifications]] and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] employed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature.  The existence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to justify our scientific inferences and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=
Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Tobin|first2=Emma|title=Natural Kinds|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2018/entries/natural-kinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article identifies some contentious issues surrounding natural kinds. It presents a minority view expressed by John Dewey that natural kinds are a false conclusion of contaminated instrumental reasoning. It presents several majority views expressed by four more recent scholars—W. V. O. Quine, Hilary Kornblith, Hasok Chang, and Rasmus Winther—that natural kinds are real and important scientific facts.

==John Dewey==
In 1938, [[John Dewey]] published ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry.''  He there explained how modern scientists practice induction and deduction, and why they have no use for natural kinds.

The philosophical issue is how humans can infer one kind of thing from another.  The traditional answer grew out of Aristotle's assertion that humans describe entities they know in two kinds of propositions.  Existential kinds known by observation are stated in "generic" propositions.  Conceptual kinds known by reasoning are stated in "universal" propositions.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|529–32}}

Dewey argued that modern scientists do not follow Aristotle in treating inductive and deductive propositions as facts already known about nature's stable structure.  They treat propositions as intermediate steps in inquiry, hypotheses about processes displaying stable patterns.  Aristotle's generic and universal propositions have become tools of inquiry rather than results of inquiry.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Propositions as such are ... provisional, intermediate and instrumental.  Since their subject-matter concerns two kinds of means, material and procedural, they are of two main categories: (1) Existential [generic means, known by induction], referring directly to actual conditions, as determined by experimental observation, and (2) ideational or conceptual [universal means, known by deduction], consisting of interrelated meanings, which are non-existential in content ... but which are applicable to existence through the operations they represent as possibilities.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|283–4}}

Modern induction starts with a question to be answered or a problem to be solved.  It identifies problematic subject-matter and seeks potentially relevant qualities and conditions.  Generic existential data thus identified are reformulated—stated abstractly as if-then universal relations capable of serving as answers or solutions.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No grounded generic propositions can be formed save as they are the products of the performance of operations indicated as possible by universal propositions.  The problem of inference is, accordingly, to discriminate and conjoin those qualities [kinds] of existential material that serve as distinguishing traits (inclusively and exclusively) of a determinate kind.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|275}}

Dewey described these abstract steps concretely with the example of the kind "morning dew."  From antiquity, the common-sense belief had been that "All dew is a kind of rain," meaning dew drops fall.  By the early 1800s the curious absence of rain and the growth of understanding led scientists to examine new qualities.  Functional qualities of bodies [kinds] as solid-liquid-gas at different temperatures, and operational constants of conduction and radiation, led to new inductive hypotheses "directly suggested by ''this'' subject-matter, not by any data [kinds] previously observable.  ....  There were certain [existential] conditions postulated in the content of the new [non-existential] conception about dew, and it had to be determined whether these conditions were satisfied in the ''observable'' facts of the case.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|430}}

After demonstrating that dew could be formed by these generic existential phenomena, and not by other phenomena, the universal hypothesis arose that dew forms following established laws of temperature and pressure.  "The outstanding conclusion is that inductive procedures are those which ''prepare'' existential material so that it has convincing evidential weight with respect to an inferred generalization.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|432}}  Existential data are not pre-known natural kinds, but become conceptual statements of "natural" processes.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Objects and qualities [kinds] as they naturally present themselves or as they are "given," are not only not the data of science but constitute the most direct and important obstacles to formation of those ideas and hypotheses that are genuinely relevant and effective.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|425}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are brought to the conclusion that it is modes of ''active response'' which are the ground of generality of logical form, not the existential immediate qualities of that which is responded to.&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

Dewey concluded that nature is not a collection of natural kinds, but rather of reliable processes discoverable by competent induction and deduction.  Assuming kinds to be given leads to the error of assuming that conceptual universal propositions can serve as evidence for generic propositions; observed consequences affirm imagined causes.  "For an 'inference' that is not ''grounded'' in the evidential nature of the material from which it is drawn is ''not'' an inference.  It is a more or less wild guess."&lt;ref name="Dew38"/&gt;{{rp|428}}  Modern induction is not a guess about natural kinds, but a means to create instrumental understanding.

==Willard Van Orman Quine==
In 1969, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] brought the term "natural kind" into contemporary analytic philosophy with an essay bearing that title.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornblith|first=Hilary|title=Inductive Inference and Its Natural Ground|publisher=MIT Press|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}  His opening paragraph laid out his approach in three parts.  First, it questioned the logical and scientific legitimacy of reasoning inductively from a few samples to all members of a kind.  "What tends to confirm an induction?"  Second, it assumed that colors are inductively-identified natural kinds, despite some logical puzzles that can be solved: non-black ravens and green-blue emeralds.  Finally, it suggested that human psychological structure can explain the illogical success of induction: "an innate flair that we have for natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Qui"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine|first=Willard Van Orman|editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]|publisher=D. Reidel|contribution=Natural Kinds|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}

Quine believed the ancient method of induction can identify kinds.  It groups experiences into kinds by recognizing qualities shared by observed similar objects: "... each [observed] black raven tends to confirm the law [universal proposition] that all ravens are black ..."  Observing shared generic traits warrants the inductive universal prediction that future experience will confirm the sharing: "And every reasonable [universal] expectation depends on resemblance of [generic] circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects." "The notion of a kind and the notion of similarity or resemblance seem to be variants or adaptations of a single [universal] notion.  Similarity is immediately definable in terms of kind; for things are similar when they are two of a kind."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Quine interpreted humanity's "innate flair for natural kinds" as intuitive recognition of criteria for judging degrees of similarity among objects.  These criteria work instrumentally when applied inductively: "... why does our innate subjective spacing [grouping] of [existential] qualities accord so well with the functionally relevant [universal] groupings in nature as to make our inductions tend to come out right?"

He admitted that generalizing after observing a few similarities is scientifically and logically unjustified.  The number and degrees of similarities and differences humans experience are infinite.  But the method is justified by its instrumental success in revealing natural kinds.  The "problem of induction" is how humans "should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate, scientifically unjustified similarity standards."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|48–9}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A standard of similarity is in some sense innate.  This point is not against empiricism; it is a commonplace of behavioral psychology.  A response to a red circle, if it is rewarded, will be elicited by a pink eclipse more readily than by a blue triangle; the red circle resembles the pink ellipse more than the blue triangle.  Without some such prior spacing of qualities, we could never acquire a [classification] habit; all stimuli would be equally alike and equally different.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Quine credited human ability to recognize colors as natural kinds to their evolutionary role in human survival—distinguishing safe from poisonous kinds of food.  He recognized that modern science often judges color similarities to be superficial, but denied that replacing obvious similarities by abstract universal similarities makes natural kinds any less permanent and important.  The human brain's capacity to recognize abstract kinds joins the brain's capacity to recognize existential similarities.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Credit is due to man's inveterate ingenuity, or human sapience, for having worked around the blinding dazzle of color vision and found the more significant regularities elsewhere.  Evidently natural selection has dealt with the conflict [between visible and invisible similarities] by endowing man doubly: with both a color-slanted quality space and the ingenuity to rise above it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He has risen above it by developing modified systems of kinds, hence modified similarity standards for scientific purposes.  By the [inductive] trial-and-error process of theorizing he has regrouped things into new kinds which prove to lend themselves to many inductions better than the old.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|49}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A man's judgments of similarity do and should depend on his theory [universal propositions], on his beliefs; but similarity itself, what the man's judgments purport to be judgments of, [is] an objective relation in the world.  It belongs in the [generic] subject matter not of our [universal] theory ... about the world, but of our [universal] theory of the [generic] world itself.  Such would be the acceptable and reputable sort of similarity concept, if it could be defined.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Quine argued that the success of innate and learned criteria for judging degrees of similarity, applied inductively to small samples of kinds, constitutes evidence of the existence of natural kinds; observed consequences affirm imagined causes.  His reasoning continues to provoke philosophical debates.

==Hilary Kornblith==
In 1993 [[Hilary Kornblith]] published a review of debates about natural kinds since Quine had launched that epistemological project a quarter-century earlier.  He evaluated Quine's "picture of natural knowledge" as natural kinds, along with subsequent refinements.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Quine's original assumption that discovering knowledge of mind-independent reality depends on inductive reasoning, despite its being illogical, continued to be acceptable.  His further assumption that success of inductive reasoning confirms both the existence of natural kinds and the legitimacy of the method also continued unquestioned, by Kornblith himself and scholars at large.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I argue that natural kinds make inductive knowledge of the world possible because the clustering of properties characteristic of natural kinds makes inferences from the presence of some of these properties to the presence of others reliable.  Were it not for the existence of natural kinds and the causal structure they require, any attempt to infer the existence of some properties from the presence of others would be no more than quixotic; reliable inductive inference would be impossible.  The [generic] causal structure of the world as exhibited in [universal] natural kinds thus provides the natural ground of inductive inference.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Quine's assumption of an innate human psychological process--"standard of similarity," "subjective spacing of qualities"—also remained unquestioned.  Kornbluth provided new labels for the necessary cognitive qualities: "native processes of belief acquisition," "the structure of human conceptual representation," "native inferential processes," "reasonably accurate detectors of covariation."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|3, 9. 95}} "To my mind, the primary case to be made for the view that our [universal] psychological processes dovetail with the [generic] causal structure of the world comes ... from the success of science.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Kornblith denied that this logic makes human classifications the same as mind-independent classifications: "The categories of modern science, of course, are not innate."&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|81}} But he offered no explanation of how the two can be distinguished.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If the scientific categories of mature sciences did not correspond, at least approximately, to real kinds in nature, but instead merely grouped objects together on the basis of salient observable properties which somehow answer to our interests, it would be utterly miraculous that inductions using these scientific categories tend to issue in accurate predictions.  Inductive inference can only work ... if there is something in nature binding together the [generic] properties which we use to identify kinds.  ....  Unobservables [universal propositions] are then postulated to explain the constant conjunction of observable properties.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|41–2}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We approach the world by presupposing that it contains natural kinds.  Our inferences depend on this presupposition,...  This presupposition thus gives us a built-in advantage in understanding what the world is like, and thereby makes inductive understanding of the world a real possibility.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|87}}
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When a population [kind] is uniform with respect to some [generic] property, [inductive] inferences from small samples, and indeed, ''from a single case'', are perfectly reliable.  If I note that a [generic] sample of [universal] copper conducts electricity and straightaway conclude that all copper conducts electricity, then I will do just as well as someone ... checking a very large number of copper samples for their conductivity.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|92–3, emphasis added}}

Kornblith didn't explain how tedious modern induction accurately attributes a generic quality to all of some universal kind.  He attributed such success to individual sensitivity that a single case is representative of all of a kind.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If we are sensitive to the situations in which a population is uniform with respect to some property, then making inferences on the basis of very small samples will be a reliable and efficient way to gain information about a population [natural kind].&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Accepting intuition as a legitimate ground for inductive inferences from small samples, Kornblith criticized popular arguments by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that intuition is irrational.  He continued to argue that traditional induction explains the success of modern science.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our [universal] conceptual and inferential tendencies jointly conspire, at least roughly, to carve  nature at its [generic] joints and project the features of a kind which are essential to it.  This preestablished harmony between the [generic] causal structure of the world and the [universal] conceptual and inferential structure of our minds produces reliable inductive inference.&lt;ref name="Qui"/&gt;{{rp|94}}

==Hasok Chang and Rasmus Gronfeldt Winther==
[[Hasok Chang]] and Rasmus Winther contributed essays to a collection entitled ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'', published in 2016.  The editor of the collection, Catherine Kendig, envisioned a new sense of natural kinds, different from traditional classifications of objects according to their "essences, laws, sameness relations, fundamental properties ... and how these map out the ontological space of the world."  She collected original works examining results of discipline-specific classifications of kinds: "the empirical use of natural kinds and what I dub 'activities of natural kinding' and 'natural kinding practices'."&lt;ref name="Ken"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kendig|first=Catherine|title=Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice|publisher=Routledge|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}}  Her natural kinds include scientific disciplines themselves, each with its own methods of inquiry and resulting natural knowledge.

Chang's contribution displayed Kendig's "natural kinding activities" or "practice turn" by reporting classifications in the discipline of chemistry—a field renowned for examples of timeless natural kinds: "All water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O;" "All gold has atomic number 79."

Taking prior classifications of kinds as given, he illustrated how chemists' methods and results are both used and developed: "how fundamental classificatory concepts become refined and corrected through our practical scientific engagement with nature. Any considerable and lasting success of such engagement generates confidence in the classificatory concepts used in it, and invites us to consider them as 'natural'."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

Chang explicitly rejected Quine's basic assumption that natural kinds are real generic objects. "When I speak of a (natural) kind in this chapter, I am referring to a [universal] classificatory concept, rather than a collection of  objects."  His kinds result from humanity's continuous knowledge-seeking activities called science and philosophy.  "Putting these notions more unambiguously in terms of concepts rather than objects, I maintain: if we hit upon some stable and effective classificatory concepts in our inquiry, we should cherish them (calling them 'natural kinds' would be one clear way of doing so), but without presuming that we have thereby found some eternal essences.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|33–4}}

Treating human classifications as natural kinds means endorsing both the practices and findings of modern scholars, without considering possible flaws in either practices or findings; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. Chang used the example of phlogiston to explain modern practice in chemistry.

Phlogiston was once considered by scientists to be a combustible object capable of explaining fire and its heat.  Phlogiston was combustible because it contained heat in latent form.  "All fire is liberated phlogiston."  But when subjected to newly-understood processes such as oxidization and calcination, the kind phlogiston failed to perform as intellectually required.  New properties of combustion led to denial of the existence of phlogiston.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

Chang did not describe the inductive and deductive methods that led chemists to dismiss phlogiston. But he argued that those methods could just as well have been successfully applied to imaginary phlogiston as to oxidization and calcination that displaced it. "I think phlogiston should have been regarded as a natural kind as much as anything else."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

Chang claimed his examples of classification practices in chemistry confirmed the fallacy of the traditional assumption that natural kinds exist as mind-independent reality.  He attributed this belief more to imagining supernatural intervention in the world, than to illogical induction.  He did not consider the popular belief that innate psychological capacities enable traditional induction to work.
{{quotation
|Much natural-kind talk has been driven by an intuitive metaphysical essentialism that concerns itself with an objective [generic] order of nature whose [universal] knowledge could, ironically, only be obtained by a supernatural being.  Let us renounce such an unnatural notion of natural kinds.  Instead, natural kinds should be conceived as something we humans may succeed in inventing and improving through scientific practice.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Rasmus Winther's Contribution to ''Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice'' gave new meaning to natural objects and qualities in the discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIS).  This "inter-discipline" engages in discovering patterns in--and displaying spatial kinds of--data, using methods that make its results unique natural kinds.
{{quotation
|Collecting and collating geographical data, building geographical data-bases, and engaging in spatial analysis, visualization, and map-making all require organizing, typologizing, and classifying geographic space, objects, relations, and processes.  I focus on the use of natural kinds ..., showing how practices of making and using kinds are contextual, fallible, plural, and purposive.  The rich family of kinds involved in these activities are here baptized mapping kinds.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|1197}}

He later identified sub-kinds of mapping kinds as "calibrating kinds," "feature kinds," and "object kinds" of "data model types."&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|202-3}}

Winther identified "inferential processes of abstraction and generalization" as methods used by GIS, and explained how they are used to generate digital maps.  He illustrated two kinds of inquiry procedures, with sub-procedures to organize data.  They are reminiscent of Dewey's multiple steps in modern inductive and deductive inference.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|205}}  Methods for transforming generic phenomena into kinds involve reducing complexity, amplifying, joining, and separating.  Methods for selecting among generic kinds involves elimination, classification, and collapse of data.

He argued that these methods for mapping kinds can be practiced in other disciplines, and briefly considered how they might harmonize three conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.

Some philosophers believe there can be a "pluralism" of kinds and classifications.  They prefer to speak of "relevant" and "interesting" kinds rather than eternal "natural" kinds.  They may be called social constructivists whose kinds are human products.  Chang's conclusions that natural kinds are human-created and instrumentally useful would appear to put him in this group.

Other philosophers, including Quine, examine the role of kinds in scientific inference. Winther does not examine Quine's commitment to traditional induction drawing conclusions from small samples of similar objects, but accepts Quine's willingness to call human-identified kinds that work natural.
{{quotation
|Quine holds that kinds are "functionally relevant groupings in nature" whose recognition permits our inductions to "tend to come out right."  That is, kinds ground fallible inductive inferences and predictions, so essential to scientific projects including those of GIS and cartography.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|207}}

Finally, Winther identified a philosophical perspective seeking to reconstruct rather than reject belief in natural kinds.  He placed Dewey in this group, although continuing to ignore incompatible views of how induction identifies generic and universal kinds.
{{quotation
|Dewey resisted the standard view of natural kinds, inherited from the Greeks ...  Instead, Dewey presents an analysis of kinds (and classes and universals) as fallible and context-specific hypotheses permitting us to address problematic situations effectively.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|208}}
Winther concludes that classifying practices used in Geographic Information Science is able to harmonize these conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.
{{quotation
|GIS and cartography suggest that kinds are simultaneously discovered [as pre-existing structures] and constructed [as human classifications].  Geographic features, processes, and objects are of course real.  Yet we must structure them in our data models and, subsequently, select and transform them in our maps.  Realism and (social) constructivism are hence not exclusive in this field.&lt;ref name="Ken"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Given the centuries of disagreement about the existential and logical reality of natural kinds, and the incoherent collection of untested common-sense propositions and tested scientific propositions on which beliefs rest, the optimistic eclecticism found in contributions to ''Natural Kinds and Classifications Practice'' is unlikely to find universal acceptance.

Theories of [[mental representation]] are those that rest the [[cognitive abilities]] of the mind on the processing of content-laden vehicles, called representations.  Naturalizing these theories involves an account of how a representation, initially posited as a theoretical construct, can be realized in a physical system.  A central aspect of any account of representation is how they derive and designate semantic content.  The possession of meaningful content is the most characteristic property of representations and arguably integral to their functionality.&lt;ref name=Ramsey2007/&gt; The project of the naturalistic philosopher is to provide an account of the representation relationship between a representation ''A'' and its object of intentional content ''a'', such that having content ''A'' is entailed by standing in a particular relation with ''a''.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;

One naturalistic account of the representation relationship is the teleofunctionalist semantics of [[Fred Dretske]].  In his book ''Explaining Behavior'', Dretske outlines a theory for how a component of a physical system can come to possess semantic content.  This theory characterizes a relationship as representational when: one entity is a natural sign of another, and the natural sign is integrated into the function of a larger system as a consequence of being an indicator.

Natural signs are those entities whose existence is dependent on preceding conditions.  Therefore, the existence of a natural sign is an indication that its preceding conditions are or were actually instantiated.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; For example, footprints in the snow are dependent on the animal that creates them, thus footprints are natural signs.  Exactly what the footprints in the snow indicate, or are natural signs of, is potentially limitless.  A man’s footprint could indicate his size, approximate weight, fashion preferences, even infirmities if there are characteristics of a limp.  Conversely, a representation’s content is not as broad, nor as unspecified.  As a result, an indication relationship could be necessary for a representation relationship, but not sufficient.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Furthermore, natural signs are dependent on the actual existence of their instantiating conditions while representations bear no such dependency relationships.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; This is the critical feature that allows representations to misrepresent something as the case when it is indeed not.

For a natural sign to become a representation requires additional constraining criteria that designate specific content from among many conditions indicated and free the indicator from absolute dependency on the existence of its instantiating conditions.  The teleological characteristics of Dretske’s theory are intended to accomplish the necessary constraints.  Specifically, to be a representation, a natural sign must be employed in the function of a larger system as a result of its holding in an indication relationship.  Since a natural sign may hold in many indication relationships, that relationship for which it is employed by the larger system is taken to be its content-specifying relationship.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt;

By being integrated into the function of a larger system, natural signs also become free of an absolute dependency on the existence of their instantiating conditions.  By contributing its properties of indication to a larger system, a natural sign gains the function of determining what the system takes to be the case.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Once this role has been given, changes in what the natural sign indicate are not necessarily reflected in what the system takes the case to be.  Thus, when appropriately integrated, natural signs become representations by identifying specific content and gaining freedom from absolute dependency on their instantiating conditions.

A major criticism of applying naturalistic theories of semantics to mental representation is that they fail to account for all the characteristics of mental states.  Mental states have characteristic phenomenal properties and these properties are not necessitated by naturalistic theories of semantics.  That is to say, these theories identify representations, with equal weight, in both conscious and unconscious systems.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;  If an explanation is consistent with the absence of phenomenal properties, then it cannot be a full account of mental states.  While this objection does nothing to undermine the progress of naturalistic theories of semantics, it demands that there are further constraining criteria before representation in mental states can be accounted for.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4454">'''Neighbourhoods Green''' is an English partnership initiative which works with [[Public housing|social landlords]] and [[housing associations]] to highlight the importance of open and [[Urban open space|green space]] for residents and raise the overall quality of design and management with these groups.

==History and governance==
The partnership was established in 2003 when [[Peabody Trust]] and Notting Hill Housing Group held a conference which identified the need to raise the profile of the green and open spaces owned and managed by social landlords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zurich.co.uk/municipal/yoursector/socialhousing/neighbourhoodsgreen.htm Neighbourhoods Green], ''Zurich Municipal Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme attracted praise from the then [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for parks and green spaces [[Yvette Cooper]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgcplus.com/lgc-news/minister-applauds-neighbourhoods-green/1276728.article Minister Applauds Neighbourhoods Green], ''Local Government Chronicle'', 4 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 the partnership has expanded to include [[National Housing Federation]], [[Groundwork UK|Groundwork]], [[The Wildlife Trusts]], [[Landscape Institute]], [[Green Flag Award]], [[Royal Horticultural Society]], [[Natural England]] and [[CABE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/linkingpeople/communities/neighbourhoodsgreen/default.aspx Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Natural England Website''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is overseen by a steering group which includes representatives from [[Circle Housing Group]], Great Places Housing Group, Helena Homes, [[London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham]], Medina Housing, New Charter Housing Trust, Notting Hill Housing, Peabody Trust, [[Places for People]], Regenda Group and Wakefield &amp; District Housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/partners Neighbourhoods Green Partners], ''Neighbourhoods Green Website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Neighbourhoods Green has three main areas of emphasis. It produces [[best practice]] guidance, highlighting the contribution parks, gardens and play areas make to the quality of life for residents – including the [[mitigation of climate change]], promotion of [[biodiversity]] and aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/news/index.php/news_articles/view/residential_green_space_boosts_community_cohesion/ Residential green space boosts community cohesion], ''Landscape Institute News and Events'' 24 Nov 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also generates a number of case studies from housing associations and community groups and offers training for landlords, residents and partners on areas such as playspace, green infrastructure and growing food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/training Training and Events], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, working in conjunction with [[University of Sheffield]] and the National Housing Federation, Neighbourhoods Green produced ''Greener Neighbourhoods'' a best practice guide to managing green space for social housing. Its ten principles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/upload/public/documents/webpage/Greener-neighbourhoods-weblinks-2110.pdf Greener Neighbourhoods : A Good Practice Guide to Managing Green Space], ''Neighbourhoods Green'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  for housing green space were:
* Commit to quality
* Involve residents
* Know the bigger picture
* Make the best use of funding
* Design for local people
* Develop training and skills	
* Maintain high standards
* Make places feel safe	
* Promote healthy living
* Prepare for climate change		

During 2013/14 Neighbourhoods Green will be working with [[Keep Britain Tidy]] to support the expansion of the Green Flag Award into the social housing sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbourhoodsgreen.org.uk/about/gfa Green Flag Award], ''Neighbourhoods Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peake's Commentary on the Bible''''' is a one-volume commentary on the [[Bible]] that gives special attention to [[biblical archaeology]] and the then-recent discoveries of biblical manuscripts.

==Editions==

===First edition===
Peake's commentary was first published in 1919 as '''''A Commentary on the Bible''''', edited by [[Arthur Samuel Peake]] (1865–1929) with the assistance of [[A. J. Grieve]] for the [[New Testament]]. There were 61 contributors, writing 96 articles. Its length was 1014 pages + 8 maps. Biblical quotation in this edition was from the [[Revised Version]] of the Bible.
*first edition: T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1919
**Publication passed to Nelson by 1920
*reprinted with a 40-page supplement edited by A. J. Grieve (after Peake's death) in 1937

===Revised edition===
The revised 1962 edition was edited by [[Matthew Black]] (1908–1994), the General and New Testament Editor and [[H. H. Rowley|Harold Henry Rowley]] (1890–1969), the Old Testament editor.  This edition was completely rewritten but on the same plan as its predecessor, including 103 articles. Black's ''Preface'' pays tribute to the original; "About one thing there was no question: there could be no departure from the Peake tradition of accurate and reliable popular scholarship." Its length was 1126 pages + 16 maps. The new edition is based on the [[Revised Standard Version]]. The 62 contributors are from all{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} branches of [[Protestantism]] in Europe and America. Its aim is to present to the layperson the "generally accepted results of Biblical Criticism, Interpretation, History and Theology".

'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychoanalysis]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]], and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

==Description==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22). Psychohistory holds that ritual child sacrifice  once  occurred  in most cultures.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[parenting]] practice and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the roots of violence|year=1980|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780374522698}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistorians, on the other hand, suggest that social behavior such as [[crime]] and [[war]] may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and  social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===Areas of study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The history of childhood – which looks at such questions as:
::*How have children been raised throughout history
::*How has the family been constituted
::*How and why have practices changed over time
::*The changing place and value of children in society over time
::*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed
:2. [[Psychobiography]] – which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
:3. Group psychohistory – which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the [[Loaded language|loaded terms]], [[metaphor]]s and repetitive words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
{{OR-section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- Only one of the people Wikipedia articles linked in this section makes any use of the word "psychohistory" in its body. That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the "Tanka prose" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of "practitioners" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the "history" of the "discipline" of "psychohistory" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. --&gt;
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of "psycho-history" to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

Psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of modern psychohistorical research, which uses different methods.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
[[Lloyd deMause]] has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Joseph F.|year=2009|title=Psychohistory: Creating a New Discipline|url=|journal=Journal of Psychohistory|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.

The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsFoundations"&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132–146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| rowspan="2" valign="top" | Infanticidal

| rowspan="2" | [[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies ("late" infanticidal childrearing).
|-
| valign="top" | ''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Infant exposure|exposed]] to death.
|-
| valign="top" | Abandoning
| valign="top" | Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name="EMOL" /&gt;
| valign="top" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].
|-
| valign="top" | Ambivalent
| valign="top" | The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.
| valign="top" | The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries.  early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].
|-
| valign="top" | Intrusive
| valign="top" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.
|-
| valign="top" | Socializing
| valign="top" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.
| valign="top" | Use of guilt, "mental discipline", [[humiliation]], [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | Helping
| valign="top" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than "[[socialize]]" them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the "helping mode") are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.  An example of this are reports of [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Gettis, J. Getis, and J. D. Fellmann (2004). ''Introduction to Geography, Ninth Edition''.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2584811 Should Prenatal Sex Selection be Restricted?: Ethical Questions and Their Implications for Research and Policy]. ''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected in political contrasts – for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W.

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{cite book

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay "The Evolution of Childhood" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of "helping mode" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] – deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to "psychohistory" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, facing criticism in the academic community,&lt;ref name="OnWriting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367–388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics referring to it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies, and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance.

DeMause has received criticism on several levels. His formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = "Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective". In ''Past, Present and Personal: The Family and The Life Course in American History''  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1986  | location = NY  | pages = 68–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the "black legend" view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been called a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources, e.g. Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800''. However, deMause received criticism for his repeated, detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical "abuses." There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336–354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories are not representative of the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |author=Marc Comtois | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061651/http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html|archivedate=March 12, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Institute for Psychohistory'' was founded by [[Lloyd deMause]]. It has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. Also the ''International Psychohistorical Association'' was founded by Lloyd deMause (in 1977) as a professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. The association hosts an annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title= Conference and Membership |url= http://www.psychohistory.us/conference-and-membership.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Psychohistory Forum'', publishes the quarterly journal ''Clio’s Psyche''.  It was founded in 1983 by historian and psychoanalyst Paul H. Elovitz. This organization of academics, therapists, and laypeople holds regular scholarly meetings in New York City and at international conventions. It also sponsors an [http://groups.google.com/group/cliospsyche online discussion group].

In Germany, scientists taking an interest in psychohistory met annually since 1987. In 1992, the ''Gesellschaft für Psychohistorie und politische Psychologie e.V'' (“Society for Psychohistory and Political Psychology”) was founded. This society issues the ''Jahrbuch für Psychohistorische Forschung'' (“Annual of Psychohistorical Research”)

The '''Rowland Institute for Science''' was founded by [[Edwin H. Land]], founder of [[Polaroid Corporation]], as a nonprofit, privately endowed basic research organization in 1980. It is named for the first head of the [[American Physical Society]], [[Henry Augustus Rowland]].  The Rowland is dedicated to experimental science across a wide range of disciplines. Research subjects at the institute includes chemistry, physics and biology, and focuses on interdisciplinary work and the development of new experimental tools.

The institute merged with [[Harvard University]] on July 1, 2002, and is now called ''The 'Rowland Institute at Harvard'''. It is located near [[Kendall Square]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a few miles away from the main campus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44756">'''Sluggish cognitive tempo''' ('''SCT''') is the term for a [[syndrome]] that may comprise a novel and distinct attention disorder from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]]. Symptoms of it include dreaminess, [[Clouding of consciousness|mental fogginess]], [[hypoactivity]], sluggishness, staring frequently, inconsistent [[alertness]] and a slow working speed.

SCT has been a subject of controversy for decades and debate about its nature still continues. But it is clear now that this set of symptoms is important because it significantly adds to impairment in ADHD and independently predicts a low [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mary Silva (Cincinnati Children's Hospital 2015).

Originally, SCT was thought to be entirely limited to about 1/3 of the [[Inattentive ADD|inattentive subtype of ADHD]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and being apparently incompatible with hyperactivity. But new studies showed that it is also seen in some with the other two ADHD subtypes – and in individuals without ADHD as well. Therefore, some psychologists and psychiatrists think it should be its own [[psychiatric disorder|mental disorder]]. Others dismiss it altogether or believe it is a separate symptom group within ADHD (like Hyperactivity, Impulsivity or Inattention). It even may be useful as a transdiagnostic concept that is shared among different mental disorders (like [[emotional dysregulation]], for example, which cuts across many disorders).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[ADHD]] is the only disorder of attention currently defined by the [[DSM-5]] or [[ICD-10]]. Formal diagnosis is made by a qualified professional. It includes demonstrating six or more of the following symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (or both).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;APA (2013)''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Persistent+pattern+of+inattention#v=snippet&amp;q=Persistent%20pattern%20of%20inattention&amp;f=false Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]'' (Fifth ed.). {{ISBN|978-0-89042-555-8}}. pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html|title=ADHD: Symptoms and Diagnosis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms must also be [[Age-inappropriate|age inappropriate]], start before age 12, occur often and be present in at least two settings. They must clearly interfere with social, school, or work functioning and not be better explained by another mental disorder. Based on the above symptoms, three types of ADHD are defined:

* a predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I)
* a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD-HI)
* a combined presentation (ADHD-C)

SCT is proposed to be a similar disorder to the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive presentation]] (ADHD-I), but can be distinguished from it by the very different symptoms shown below who were developed by leading researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2016|title=The Internal, External, and Diagnostic Validity of Sluggish Cognitive Tempo: A Meta-Analysis and Critical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288021110|journal=Journal of the AACAP.|volume=55|issue=|pages=163–178|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2015.12.006|pmc=4764798|via=|author=Stephen P.

As a  comparison of both tables shows, there is no overlap between the official ADHD-I symptoms and those for SCT (although both may exist in parallel within the same person). Yet, one problem is still that some individuals who actually have SCT are currently misdiagnosed with the inattentive presentation. &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D_PswEACAAJ|title=Oxford textbook of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780191059766|edition=First|location=|pages=147–154|chapter=Sluggish cognitive tempo (Chapter 15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social behaviour ===
In many ways, those who have an SCT profile have some of the opposite symptoms of those with classic ADHD: instead of being [[hyperactive]], [[extroverted]], obtrusive, excessively energetic and risk takers, those with SCT are drifting, [[Absent-mindedness|absent-minded]], listless, [[Introspection|introspective]] and daydreamy. They feel as if "in the fog" and seem "out of it".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Russel A. Barkley (2013): [https://books.google.com/books?id=BSLF7yueqoUC&amp;pg=PA150 Two Types of Attention Disorders Now Recognized by Clinical Scientists.] In: Taking Charge of ADHD: The Complete, Authoritative Guide for Parents''. Guilford Press (3rd ed.), p.150. {{ISBN|978-1-46250-789-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] psychiatric problems often associated with SCT are more often of the [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing types]], such as [[anxiety]], unhappiness or [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caryn Carlson, Miranda Mann|first=|year=2002|title=Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Predicts a Different Pattern of Impairment in the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caryn_Carlson/publication/11514939_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_Predicts_a_Different_Pattern_of_Impairment_in_the_Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder_Predominantly_Inattentive_Type/links/53e9241b0cf2fb1b9b64f355.pdf|journal=Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=123–129|doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3101_14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most consistent across studies was a pattern of reticence and [[Shyness|social withdrawal]] in interactions with peers. Their typically shy nature and slow response time has often been misinterpreted as aloofness or disinterest by others. In social group interactions, those with SCT may be ignored. People with classic ADHD are more likely to be rejected in these situations, because of their social [[intrusiveness]] or aggressive behavior. Compared to children with SCT, they are also much more likely to show [[Externalizing disorders|antisocial behaviours]] like [[substance abuse]], [[oppositional-defiant disorder]] or [[conduct disorder]] (frequent lying, stealing, fighting etc.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fittingly, in terms of personality, ADHD seems to be associated with sensitivity to reward and fun seeking while SCT may be associated with [[Fear of negative evaluation|punishment sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2013|title=Reward and punishment sensitivity are differentially associated with ADHD and sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms in children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/256287832_Reward_and_punishment_sensitivity_are_differentially_associated_with_ADHD_and_sluggish_cognitive_tempo_symptoms_in_children/links/0a85e53262a0de646f000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47|issue=|pages=719–727|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.07.001|via=|author=Stephen P. Becker et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Attention deficits ===
Those with SCT symptoms may show a qualitatively different kind of attention deficit that is more typical of a true information input-output problem, such as poor [[Selective attention|focusing of attention]] on details or the capacity to distinguish important from unimportant information rapidly. In contrast, people with ADHD have more difficulties with [[Sustained attention|persistence of attention]] and action toward goals coupled with impaired resistance to responding to distractions. Unlike SCT, they also have no difficulty processing information or selecting and filtering sensory input. Instead, those with classic ADHD have problems with [[Impulsiveness|inhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Weiler et al. (2002): [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00222194020350050501 Information Processing Deficits in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Inattentive Type, and Children with Reading Disability]. doi: 10.1177/00222194020350050501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some think that SCT and ADHD produce two different kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the attentional style in SCT may be more halting and sluggish, whereas in ADHD it is jumpy and flighty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEhsBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0|title=Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult ADHD: An integrative psychosocial and medical approach.|first=J. Russell|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0415955003|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=11–12|quote=The classic presentation of ADHD involves features of high distractibility and poor attention vigilance, which can be considered as examples of attention and sustained concentration being engaged but then punctuated or interrupted. In contrast, SCT/CDD is characterized by difficulties orienting and engaging attention, effort, and alertness in the first place.|via=|author=Ramsay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary V. Solanto|first=|year=2007|title=Neurocognitive Functioning in AD/HD, Predominantly Inattentive and Combined Subtypes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265203/pdf/nihms33023.pdf|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=35|pages=729–44|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9123-6|quote=Differences between subtypes in cognitive tempo point to potentially important differences in the qualitative features of inattention, which suggest differences in etiology. Thus, whereas children with predominantly inattentive type (PI) appear to be slow to orient and slow to respond to cognitive and social stimuli in their immediate surroundings, children with combined type (CB) rapidly orient to novel external stimuli regardless of relevance. A series of studies in children who would now be classified as CB failed to identify deficits in the stimulus input stages of information-processing (Sergeant, 2005). The observably more sluggish orientation and response style of the child with PI by contrast, does suggest deficits in these early attentional processes.|via=|pmc=2265203|pmid=17629724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both disorders interfere significantly with academic performance but may do so by different means. SCT may be more problematic with the accuracy of the work a child does in school and lead to  making more errors. Conversely, ADHD may more adversely affect productivity which represents the amount of work done in a particular time interval. Children with SCT seem to have more difficulty with consistently remembering things that were previously learned and make more mistakes on [[Recall (memory)|memory retrieval]] tests than do children with ADHD. They have been found to perform much worse on psychological tests involving perceptual-motor speed or [[hand-eye coordination]] and speed. They also have a more disorganized thought process, a greater degree of sloppiness, and lose things more easily. The risk for additional [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]] seems equal in both ADHD and SCT (23–50%) but math disorders may be more frequent in the SCT-group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A key behavioral characteristic of those with SCT symptoms is that they are more likely to appear to be lacking motivation and may even have an unusually higher frequency of daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen P. Becker et al.|first=|year=2014|title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Dimensions and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Symptoms in Relation to College Students’ Sleep Functioning|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/260153858_Attention-DeficitHyperactivity_Disorder_Dimensions_and_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_Symptoms_in_Relation_to_College_Students'_Sleep_Functioning/links/00b7d52f9811d748ba000000.pdf|journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=675–685|doi=10.1007/s10578-014-0436-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to lack energy to deal with mundane tasks and will consequently seek to concentrate on things that are mentally stimulating perhaps because of their [[Low arousal theory|underaroused state]]. Alternatively, SCT may involve a pathological form of excessive [[mind-wandering]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Executive function ===
The [[executive system]] of the human brain provides for the cross-temporal organization of behavior towards goals and the future and coordinates actions and strategies for everyday goal-directed tasks.  Essentially, this system permits humans to self-regulate their behavior so as to sustain action and problem solving toward goals specifically and the future more generally. [[Dysexecutive syndrome]] is defined as a "cluster of impairments generally associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain" which includes "difficulties with high-level tasks such as planning, organising, initiating, monitoring and adapting behaviour".&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|year=|title=Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS)|url=http://www.sxf.uevora.pt/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Munir_2003.pdf#page=38|journal=Journal of Occupational Psychology, Employment and Disability|volume=5|issue=2|pages=33–37|issn=1740-4193|via=|last1=Barbara A. Wilson|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive deficits pose serious problems for a person's ability to engage in self-regulation over time to attain their goals and anticipate and prepare for the future.

[[Adele Diamond]] postulated that the core cognitive deficit of those with ADHD-I is [[working memory]], or, as she coined in her recent paper on the subject, "childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome".&lt;ref name="Diamond05" /&gt; However, two more recent studies by Barkley found that while children and adults with SCT had some deficits in [[executive functions]] (EF) in everyday life activities, they were primarily of far less magnitude and largely centered around problems with self-organization and problem-solving.  Even then, analyses showed that most of the difficulties with EF deficits were the result of overlapping ADHD symptoms that may co-exist with SCT rather than being attributable to SCT itself.  More research on the link of SCT to EF deficits is clearly indicated—but, as of this time, SCT does not seem to be as strongly associated with EF deficits as is ADHD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
SCT is currently not an official diagnosis in [[DSM-5]] and no universally accepted set of symptoms exists yet. But there are [[rating scale]]s that can be used to screen for SCT symptoms such as the ''Concentration Inventory'' (for children and adults) or the ''Barkley Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Scale-Children and Adolescents (BSCTS-CA)''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Becker et al.: [http://stephenbecker.weebly.com/measures.html Concentration Inventory for Children and Adults].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ''Comprehensive Behaviour Rating Scale for Children'' (CBRSC), an older scale, can also be used for SCT as this case study shows.&lt;ref name="KamphausFrick2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3sqjg8j7P8C&amp;pg=PA395|title=Clinical Assessment of Child And Adolescent Personality And Behavior|author1=Randy W. Kamphaus|first=|author2=Paul J. Frick|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2005|isbn=978-0-387-26300-7|location=|pages=395|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although having no diagnosic code either, [[ICD-10]] mentions the SCT group as a reason for why it did not replace the term ''"[[Hyperkinetic disorder|Hyperkinetic Disorder]]''" with ''"ADHD".''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf#206|title=ICD-10 – Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|last=|first=|publisher=WHO (2010)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=206|chapter=Hyperkinetic disorders (F90)|quote=In recent years the use of the diagnostic term attention deficit disorder" for these syndromes has been promoted.  It has not been used here because it implies a knowledge of psychological processes that is not yet available, and it suggests the inclusion of anxious, preoccupied, or "dreamy" apathetic children whose problems are probably different.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mental disorders may produce similar symptoms to SCT (e.g. excessive daydreaming or "staring blankly") and should not be confused with it. Examples might be conditions like [[depersonalization disorder]], [[dysthymia]], [[hypothyroidism|thyroid problems]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[absence seizure]]s, [[Bipolar II disorder]], [[Kleine–Levin syndrome]], forms of [[autism]] or [[schizoid personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="DSM3"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm3.pdf#323|title=Schizoid Personality Disorder, Associated features|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0521315289|volume=[[DSM-III]] (1980)|location=|pages=310|chapter=|quote=Individuals with this disorder are often unable to express aggressiveness or hostility. They may seem vague about their goals, indecisive in their actions, self-absorbed, absentminded, and detached from their environment (''not with it'' or ''in a fog'').  Excessive daydreaming is often present.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002500/http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm3.pdf#323|archive-date=2017-02-02|dead-url=yes|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prevalence of SCT in these clinical populations has yet to be empirically and systematically investigated.

== Impact on functioning ==
Additional requirements for a proposed SCT diagnosis (such as the number and duration of symptoms or the impact on functioning) are continuing to be investigated. But there is no doubt that both ADHD and SCT are found in children and adults and are linked to significant impairment and a diminished [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life (QoL)]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; SCT on its own is linked to increased stress as well as lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The research by Barkley suggests that ADHD and SCT compound each other if they occur together: In adults, those comorbid cases were more likely to be unmarried and to be out of work on disability compared to cases with ADHD only. But SCT alone is also present in the population and can be quite impairing in educational and occupational settings, even if it is not as pervasively impairing as ADHD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Unlike ADHD, the general causes of SCT symptoms are almost unknown, though one recent study of twins suggested that the condition appears to be nearly as heritable or genetically influenced in nature as ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2014|title=A Twin Study of the Relationships among Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Problems|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/182b/9e7e797481546b9dc13c24c350aa8ecf4220.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=42|issue=|pages=63–75|doi=10.1007/s10802-013-9725-0|via=|author=Sara Moruzzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say that the majority of differences among individuals in these traits in the population may be due mostly to variation in their genes. The heritability of SCT symptoms in that study was only slightly lower than that for ADHD symptoms with a somewhat greater share of trait variation being due to unique environmental events. For instance, in ADHD, the genetic contribution to individual differences in ADHD traits typically averages between 75 and 80% and may even be as high as 90%+ in some studies.  That for SCT may be 50–60%.

Far less is known about SCT yet the symptoms seem to indicate that the posterior attention networks may be more involved in the disorder than the prefrontal cortex region of the brain and difficulties with working memory so prominent in ADHD. This hypothesis gained greater support following a 2015 fMRI-study comparing Inattentive ADHD and SCT-diagnosed patients, which found that the left [[superior parietal lobule]] (SPL) showed remarkably decreased activity in SCT-[[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2015|title=Differentiating SCT and inattentive symptoms in ADHD using fMRI measures of cognitive control|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d06a/e7a531a6ac492a0455eb2cf4dc61fa457fef.pdf|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|volume=8|issue=|pages=390–397|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2015.05.007|pmid=26106564|via=|author=Catherine Fassbender et al.|pmc=4474281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ADHD in which there exist hundreds of studies on molecular genetics identifying candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, there are no studies of molecular genetics that specifically evaluated individuals having SCT. Although ADHD appears to be linked to problems with the availability of or sensitivity to [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] and the efficiency of the large chemical structures of the specific receptors and re-uptake receptors, the neurotransmitters that may be linked to SCT are unknown.

Recently a study showed a small link between thyroid functioning and SCT symptoms suggesting that thyroid dysfunction is not the cause of SCT. High rates of SCT were observed in children who had suffered [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder|prenatal alcohol exposure]] and in survivors of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]], where they were associated with [[Radiation therapy#Late side effects|cognitive late effects]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2012|title=A preliminary investigation of the relation between thyroid functioning and sluggish cognitive tempo in children|url=|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|volume=|issue=|page=|pages=|doi=10.1177/1087054712466917|via=|author=Stephen Becker et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2013|title=Prenatal Alcohol Exposure, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo|url=http://www.uncnri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Prenatal-Alcohol-Exposure-ADHD-and-Sluggish-Cognitive-Tempo.pdf|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research|volume=37|issue=|pages=338–346|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01886.x|via=|author=Diana M.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of SCT has not been well investigated. Initial drug studies were done only with the ADHD medication [[methylphenidate]] (e.g. Ritalin'''®'''), and even then only with children who were diagnosed as ADD without hyperactivity (using [[DSM III#DSM-III (1980)|DSM-III]] criteria) and not specifically for SCT. The research seems to have found that most children with ADD with Hyperactivity (currently ADHD-C) responded well at medium-to-high doses.&lt;ref name="Diamond05"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2005|title=ADD (ADHD without hyperactivity): a neurobiologically and behaviorally distinct disorder from ADHD with hyperactivity|journal=Dev. Psychopathol.|volume=17|issue=3|pages=807–25|doi=10.1017/S0954579405050388|via=|author=Adele Diamond|pmc=1474811|pmid=16262993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a sizable percentage of children with ADD without hyperactivity (currently ADHD-I, therefore the results may apply to SCT) did not gain much benefit from [[methylphenidate]], and when they did benefit, it was at a much lower dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=1991|title=Attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity: clinical response to three dose levels of methylphenidate|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/87/4/519..info|journal=Pediatrics|volume=87|issue=4|pages=519–531|pmid=2011430|via=|author1=Russell A. Barkley, George DuPaul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one study and a retrospective analysis of medical histories found that the presence or absence of SCT symptoms made no difference in response to methylphenidate in children with ADHD-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2009|title=Do Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Symptoms Predict Response to Methylphenidate in Patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder–Inattentive Type?|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychopharmacology|volume=19|issue=4|pages=461–465|doi=10.1089/cap.2008.0115|via=|author1=Henrique T. Ludwig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But these studies did not specifically and explicitly examine the effect of the drug on SCT symptoms in children. The only medication study to date who did this used [[atomoxetine]] (Strattera) and found it to have significant beneficial effects that were independent of ADHD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith McBurnett|first=|year=2016|title=Atomoxetine-Related Change in Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Is Partially Independent of Change in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Inattentive Symptoms|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–42|doi=10.1089/cap.2016.0115|via=|pmid=27845858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one study has investigated the use of [[behavior modification]] methods at home and school for children with predominantly SCT symptoms and it found good success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linda Pfiffner|first=|year=2007|title=A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Integrated Home-School Behavioral Treatment for ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type|url=|journal=J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1041–1050|doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e318064675f|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that sluggish cognitive tempo is the subject of pharmaceutical company clinical drug trials, including ones by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] that proposed that one of its biggest-selling drugs, [[Strattera]], could be prescribed to treat proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo.&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt; Other researchers believe that there is no effective treatment for SCT.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
The [[prognosis]] of SCT is unknown. In contrast, much is known about the adolescent and adult outcomes of children having ADHD. Those with SCT symptoms typically show a later onset of their symptoms than do those with ADHD, perhaps by as much as a year or two later on average. They have as much or more difficulty with academic tasks and far fewer social difficulties than do people having ADHD. They do not have the same risks for oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or social aggression and thus may have different life course outcomes compared to children with ADHD-HI and Combined subtypes who have far higher risks for these other "[[Externalizing disorders|externalizing]]" disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, unlike ADHD, there are no longitudinal studies of children with SCT that can shed light on the developmental course and adolescent or adult outcomes of these individuals.

== Epidemiology ==
Recent studies indicate that the symptoms of SCT in children form two dimensions: daydreamy-spacey and sluggish-lethargic, and that the former are more distinctive of the disorder from ADHD than the latter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erik G. Willcutt|first=|year=2013|title=The Internal and External Validity of Sluggish Cognitive Tempo and its Relation with DSM–IV ADHD|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=21–35|doi=10.1007/s10802-013-9800-6|via=|pmc=3947432|pmid=24122408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2009|title=Developing a measure of sluggish cognitive tempo for children: Content validity, factor structure, and reliability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Klein/publication/26779098_Developing_a_Measure_of_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_for_Children_Content_Validity_Factor_Structure_and_Reliability/links/00b7d51e4075e67678000000.pdf|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=21|issue=3|pages=380–389|doi=10.1037/a0016600|via=|author1=Ann Marie Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same pattern was recently found in the first study of adults with SCT by Barkley and also in more recent studies of college students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These studies indicated that SCT is probably not a subtype of ADHD but a distinct disorder from it. Yet it is one that overlaps with ADHD in 30–50% of cases of each disorder, suggesting a pattern of comorbidity between two related disorders rather than subtypes of the same disorder. Nevertheless, SCT is strongly correlated with ADHD inattentive and combined subtypes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to a Norwegian study, "SCT correlated significantly with inattentiveness, regardless of the subtype of ADHD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benedicte Skirbekk et al.|first=|year=2011|title=The relationship between sluggish cognitive tempo, subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety disorders|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=513–525|doi=10.1007/s10802-011-9488-4|via=|pmid=21331639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}

===Early observations===
[[File:H Hoffmann Struwwel 22.jpg|thumb|upright|230px|Johnny Head-in-Air is an absent-minded boy who seems unaware of his surroundings.]]

There have been descriptions in literature for centuries of children who are very inattentive and prone to foggy thought.

Symptoms similar to [[ADHD]] were first systematically described in 1775 by [[History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder#Melchior Adam Weikard|Melchior Adam Weikard]] and in 1798 by [[Alexander Crichton]] in their medical textbooks. Although Weikard mainly described a single disorder of attention resembling the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD, Crichton postulates an additional attention disorder, described as a "morbid diminution of its power or energy", and further explores possible "corporeal" and "mental" causes for the disorder (including "irregularities in diet, excessive evacuations, and the abuse of corporeal desires"). However, he does not further describe any symptoms of the disorder, making this an early but certainly non-specific reference to an SCT-like syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlRJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA254|title=An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement|last=Alexander Crichton|first=|date=1798|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 2. On Attention, and its diseases|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One example from fictional literature is [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s character of "Johnny Head-in-Air" (''Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft''), in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (1845). (Some researchers see several characters in this book as showing signs of child psychiatric disorders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=1970|title=Hyperactive children|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=222|issue=|pages=94–98|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0470-94|via=|author=Mark A. Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian pediatrician Guy Falardeau, besides working with hyperactive children, also wrote about very dreamy, quiet and well-behaved children that he encountered in his practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Falardeau|title=Les enfants hyperactifs et lunatiques|year=1997|ISBN=978-2890446267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First research efforts===

In more modern times, research surrounding attention disorders has traditionally focused on hyperactive symptoms, but began to newly address inattentive symptoms in the 1970s. Influenced by this research, the [[DSM-III]] (1980) allowed for the first time a diagnosis of an ADD subtype that presented without hyperactivity. Researchers exploring this subtype created rating scales for children which included questions regarding symptoms such as short attention span, distractibility, drowsiness, and passivity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen P. Becker et al.|first=|year=2014|title=Sluggish cognitive tempo in abnormal child psychology: an historical overview and introduction to the special section|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Becker/publication/258856101_Sluggish_Cognitive_Tempo_in_Abnormal_Child_Psychology_An_Historical_Overview_and_Introduction_to_the_Special_Section/links/00b4952dd32463fafb000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1007/s10802-013-9825-x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1980s, it was proposed that as opposed to the then accepted dichotomy of ADD with or without hyperactivity (ADD/H, ADD/noH), instead a three factor model of ADD was more appropriate, consisting of hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention-disorganization, and slow tempo subtypes.&lt;ref name="Lahey88"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=1988|title=Dimensions and Types of Attention Deficit Disorder|url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)65585-4/|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=27|issue=3|pages=330–335|doi=10.1097/00004583-198805000-00011|via=|vauthors=Lahey BB, Pelham WE, Schaughency EA, Atkins MS, Murphy A, Hynd G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Weinberg and Brumback proposed a new disorder: "primary disorder of vigilance" (PVD). Characteristic symptoms of it were difficulty sustaining [[alertness]] and [[arousal]], daydreaming, difficulty focusing attention, losing one's place in activities and conversation, slow completion of tasks and a kind personality. The most detailed case report in their article looks like a prototypical representation of SCT. The authors acknowledged an overlap of PVD and ADHD but argued in favor of considering PVD to be distinct in its unique cognitive impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/book/10.3109/9781420017144|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder – Concepts, Controversies, New Directions.|last=Keith McBurnett|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8247-2927-1|location=|page=352|pages=|chapter=Sluggish Cognitive Tempo: The Promise and Problems of Measuring Syndromes in the Attention Spectrum|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren Weinberg, Roger Brumback|first=|year=1990|title=Primary disorder of vigilance: A novel explanation of inattentiveness, daydreaming, boredom, restlessness, and sleepiness|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002234760582654X|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=116|issue=5|pages=720–725|doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82654-x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problematic with the paper is that it dismissed ADHD as a nonexistent disorder (despite it having several thousand research studies by then) and preferred the term PVD for this SCT-like symptom complex.  A further difficulty with the PVD diagnosis is that not only is it based merely on 6 cases instead of the far larger samples of SCT children used in other studies but the very term implies that science has established the underlying cognitive deficits giving rise to SCT symptoms, and this is hardly the case.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With the publication of [[DSM-IV]] in 1994, the disorder was labeled as [[ADHD]], and was divided into three subtypes: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. Of the proposed SCT specific symptoms discussed while developing the DSM-IV, only "forgetfulness" was included in the symptom list for ADHD-I, and no others were mentioned. However, several of the proposed SCT symptoms were included in the diagnosis of "ADHD, not otherwise specified".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Prior to 2001, there were a total of four scientific journal articles specifically addressing symptoms of SCT. But then a researcher suggested that sluggish tempo symptoms (such as inconsistent alertness and orientation) were, in fact, adequate for the diagnosis of ADHD-I. Thus, he argued, their exclusion from DSM-IV was inappropriate.&lt;ref name="McBurnett01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keith McBurnett et al|year=2001|title=Symptom properties as a function of ADHD type: An argument for continued study of sluggish cognitive tempo|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=207–213|doi=10.1023/A:1010377530749|via=|pmid=11411783}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research article and its accompanying commentary urging the undertaking of more research on SCT spurred the publication of over 30 scientific journal articles to date which specifically address symptoms of SCT.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, with the publication of [[DSM-5]] in 2013, ADHD continues to be classified as predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type and there continues to be no mention of SCT as a diagnosis or a diagnosis subtype anywhere in the manual. The diagnosis of "ADHD, not otherwise specified"  also no longer includes any mention of SCT symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similarly, [[ICD-10]], the medical diagnostic manual, has no diagnosis code for SCT. Although SCT is not recognized as a disorder at this point, researchers continue to debate its usefulness as a construct and its implications for further attention disorder research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Controversy ==

Significant skepticism has been raised within the medical and scientific communities as to whether SCT, currently considered a "symptom cluster," actually exists as a distinct disorder.&lt;ref name="schwarz1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/health/idea-of-new-attention-disorder-spurs-research-and-debate.html |title=Idea of New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and Debate|author=Alan Schwarz |work=The New York Times |date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Allen Frances]], an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University, has commented "We're seeing a fad in evolution: Just as ADHD has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another. This is a public health experiment on millions of kids...I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant. The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world."&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt;

[[UCLA]] researcher and [[Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology]] editorial board member Steve S. Lee has also expressed concern based on SCT's close relationship to ADHD, cautioning that a pattern of over-diagnosis of the latter has "already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources." Lee states, "The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have [sluggish cognitive tempo], and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real...ADHD has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of SCT."&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt;

Adding to the controversy are potential conflicts of interest among the condition's proponents, including the funding of prominent SCT researchers' work by the global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly&lt;ref name="schwarz1" /&gt; and, in the case of [[Russell Barkley|Dr. Russell Barkley]], a leader in the burgeoning SCT research field, direct financial ties to that company (Dr. Barkley has received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly).&lt;ref name=ProPublica&gt;{{cite web|title=Has Your Health Professional Received Drug Company Money?|url=http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/search?utf8=_&amp;term=barkley&amp;state%5Bid%5D=41&amp;company%5Bid%5D=&amp;period%5B%5D=&amp;services%5B%5D=|work=[[ProPublica]]|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to the "increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT", Dr. Barkley writes "The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others."&lt;ref name="Barkley, R. A. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

The '''sociological study of [[peace]], [[war]], and [[social conflict]]''' entails the use of [[sociological theory]] and methods to analyze [[group conflict]]s, especially [[collective violence]] and alternative constructive nonviolent forms of [[conflict transformation]].  

The [[by-law|by-laws]] of the Section on Peace, War and Social Conflict of the [[American Sociological Association]] specify:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html What is the Peace, War, and Social Conflict Section?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911102238/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html |date=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose of the Section on Peace, War, and Social Conflict is to foster the development and application of sociological theories and methods for the understanding and study of dynamics of collective conflict and its prevention, conduct, and resolution. Included is the study of military institutions and conflict between collectivities such as countries, ethnic groups, political movements, and religious groups. Also included are the roles of military organizations, other governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and social movements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Swanwick Writers' Summer School''' is an annual writers' conference held at The [[Hayes Conference Centre]], near Swanwick, Derbyshire. Founded in 1948, and first held in the summer of 1949, it is believed to be the oldest independent writers' school in the world. Established as a charity and run on a not for profit basis, it was inspired by the London Writers Circle. Early celebrities that featured at the School  included, [[Vera Brittain]], [[L.P. Hartley]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]&lt;ref name="Hilliard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilliard|first=Christopher|title=To Exercise Our Talents: The Democratization of Writing in Britain|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Victor|title=The Fellowship of Swanwick|date=October 1949|publisher=Writer Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chairman was [[Cecil Hunt]], a chairman of the London Writers' Circle. Early delegates included the booker prize nominee, [[Barbara Pym]], one of whose novels, ''No Fond Return of Love'', is inspired, in part, by Swanwick itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pym|first=Barbara|title=No Fond Return of Love|date=2002|publisher=Moyer Bell|location=Wickford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cocking|first=Yvonne|title=A Thankless Task?|journal=Paper to The Barbara Pym North American Conference|date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the school for over fifteen years as member, host and lecturer was Booker Prize Winner [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]]. He refers to the role Swanwick plays  in creative writing in his published essays.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=My appointment with the muse|date=1986|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0434626007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Paul|title=On writing and the novel - essays|date=1987|publisher=Morrow|isbn=0688069096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years Swanwick has played an important role in the social development of creative writing.&lt;ref name="Wandor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wandor|first=Micheline|title=The Author Is Not Dead, Merely Somewhere Else: Creative Writing After Theory,|date=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Nancy|title=Venture of Faith - A History of Swanwick|date=1983|publisher=H.E.

Established postwar, it formed part of the continuing process of democratization of writing begun by many amateur groups in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Hilliard"/&gt; From its founding in 1948, the aim of the school has been to provide a social and educational framework for the development of creative writing skills.&lt;ref name="Wandor"/&gt; Its role in the establishment of creative writing in the UK has meant that it has been a platform for eminent speakers, from [[Hammond Innes]] in 1952 to Sir [[Terry Pratchett]].&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; It has also been closely associated with the development of women's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Sylvia|title=The Woman Writer: The History of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members range from seasoned authors with numerous published books to those new to writing. The inclusive community is designed to enable the sharing of experiences, best practice and support for individual writers' creative writing.

[[Derbyshire Record Office]] houses the school's historical records, reflecting its importance in the development of creative writing in the UK. These archives (ref: D5886) include the school minutes; comment books and correspondence.

== Authors ==

Noted authors who have been members of the school over the years include [[Eleanor Hibbert|Eleanor Burford]], [[John Boland (author)|John Boland]], [[Barbara Pym]], [[Vivian Stuart]], [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]], [[Nina Bawden]], [[Carla Lane]] and [[Margaret Drabble]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

== Topwrite ==

In 2005, the School obtained a grant from [[Big Lottery Fund|Awards for All]] to launch the TopWrite project to support young writers and help close the gaps between the commercial, literary and academic writing worlds.

The '''Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study''' (SCAS) is an institute for advanced study in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]]. It is one of the nine member institutions of the [[Some Institutes for Advanced Study]] consortium, which brings together the world's most distinguished institutes for advanced study.

The Collegium was founded in 1985, chartered by the Swedish government and offers one-semester and one-year fellowships to visiting scholars, ranging from postdoctoral to professorial positions. Since January 2007, it is located in the [[Linneanum]] in the [[Uppsala University Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://regler.uu.se/digitalAssets/100/100790_budgetunderlag-uu-2008-2010.pdf Uppsala Universitet: Budgetunderlag 2008-2010, bil. 5, p. 1]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier located in a villa in the Kåbo district of Uppsala.

The '''Tehran School of Political Science''' ({{lang-fa|مدرسه علوم سياسی تهران}} ''Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi''), was one of the first modern institutions of higher education in Iran at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==

The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by [[Hassan Pirnia]]. It was run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It later merged with the School of Law (''Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq''), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1933.

==People==
===Political===
Many of the school's faculty and [[alumni]] later became ministers and political figures in Iran. Notable examples are:

'''The Rolling Stones Museum''' is a [[museum]] in [[Portorož]] in [[Slovenia]]. It is dedicated to the British rock band [[The Rolling Stones]]. The music television programme ''VH1'' proclaimed it in 2013 one of the "10 Truly Insane Music Museums + Shrines".

== Background ==
The origin of the collection goes back to 1964 when Slavko Franca (born 1949 ) bought his first LP of the band. It was the start of the largely extended collection of memorabilia that can be seen in the museum today.&lt;ref name="Primorske Novice"&gt;Primorske Novice, [http://www.primorske.si/Priloge/7--Val/Slavko-Franca-je-kustos-svojega-zasebnega-muzeja-R.aspx Slavko Franca je kustos svojega zasebnega muzeja Rolling Stonesov], 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His profession as ship chief engineer, enabled him to collect items from all over the world.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik"&gt;Dnevnik, [https://www.dnevnik.si/1042531376  "Beatlesi so bili pop, Stonesi so mi najbolj pri srcu" ], 23 mei 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He started his museum at his home in [[Portorož]], a coastal village in the Slovenian part of [[Istria]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Franca is a fan since the band began. Even one of his cats is called ''Paint It Black'', after the [[Paint It Black|song with the same name]] (1966) of the Rolling Stones.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik" /&gt; He has travelled to around fifty concerts worldwide to see shows of them.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The first one was in [[Milan]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="Primorske Novice" /&gt; The band, which has given more than 1,700 concerts in 40 countries, has never played in Slovenia. The 50th anniversary in London, since the first concert of the Stones there, was celebrated at the museum by three hundred guests and a concert of [[Chris Jagger]], the younger brother of band member Mick.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

The music television programme ''VH1'' proclaimed the museum in 2013 one of the "10 Truly Insane Music Museums + Shrines."&lt;ref&gt;Dnevnik, [https://www.dnevnik.si/1042706717 Na seznamu najbolj nenavadnih muzejev na svetu tudi muzej Slovenca], 14 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VH1, Viacom, [http://www.vh1.com/news/54706/crazy-music-museums/  10 Truly Insane Music Museums + Shrines], Frank Donovan, 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The museum houses a collection of around 1,000 atifacts, among which the [[guitar pick]] that band member [[Keith Richards]] once threw to Franca during a show in [[Belgium]]. Furthermore, there are oil paintings, posters, photos, records, beer glasses,&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Wall Street Journal, [http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A001-20121210.pdf Fan Hoping to See Rolling Stones In Slovenia Gets No Satisfaction], 9 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; T-shirts, fan articles, magazines, newspaper articles, music instruments like a guitar with signatures, and other memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;Slavko Franca, Rolling Stones museum Portoroz, Slovenia, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxU004yIcY collection] (video)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wealthy Barber''''', full title (''The Wealthy Barber: The Common Sense Guide to Successful Financial Planning'') is a [[financial planning]] book franchise by [[Canadian]] author [[David Barr Chilton|David Chilton]].  The first book in the series was in the [[business fable]] genre, using the story of fictional characters to convey financial advice.

==Plot summary==

The book is structured around a story of three people in their late 20s visiting Roy, the title character, for lessons in financial planning. Each chapter of the book describes a different visit and a different element of financial planning. Each month along with their lessons the three students are required to start carrying out the actions prescribed by Roy. In addition to these individuals, Roy also shares his financial knowledge with the customers of his barber shop.

The story is set primarily in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], where Roy has been operating a barber shop for several decades. As a young man, Roy had planned to become a lawyer, but those plans are derailed.  He ends up taking over his father's barber shop. Worried about money, Roy visits Mr. White, one of the town's wealthiest men, and asks for advice on financial planning. This advice paves the way for Roy's accumulating wealth.

The basis of the book is Roy's advice to "save 10 per cent of all that you earn and invest it for long-term growth."  In that, it draws from the advice first set forth in [[The Richest Man in Babylon (book)|The Richest Man in Babylon]].  Subsequent chapters discuss wills and life insurance, [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan|RRSP]]s, buying a home, income tax and saving and spending.

Roy (and thus Chilton) is not as harshly anti-debt as some other authors, like [[Dave Ramsey]].  However Roy does advise that extra money should go to pay off debt, and that credit cards are "[[anathema]]" to well-run personal finances.  Roy does believe that if you are investing 10% and maxing out your RRSP, day-to-day spending doesn't matter too much to your overall financial picture.

==Main characters==

Dave is an expecting father who realizes he is not financially prepared. His worries lead him to seek financial advice from the local barber.

Cathy is already rich but relates to the audience members who don’t necessarily understand the market and how it works, thus do not generally invest their earnings.

Roy, the barber, poses as the financial expert who has become wealthy simply by being wary of his money and intelligently spending, saving and investing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/01/20/review-the-wealthy-barber/ |title= Review: The Wealthy Barber |date= January 20, 2007 |publisher= The Simple Dollar |first= Trent |last= Hamm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Wealthy Barber Returns''==

===Summary===

In the sequel, '''''The Wealthy Barber Returns''''' (full title ''The Wealthy Barber Returns: Significantly Older and Marginally Wiser, David Chilton Offers His Unique Perspectives on the World of Money''), Chilton dispenses with the device of characters, representing his advice this time in his own voice.  The book is divided into 54 short chapters,  dispensing advice on miscellaneous topics in savings and investments, with a particular focus on avoiding reckless spending behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/the-wealthy-barber-returns/article1362752/ |title= The Wealthy Barber Returns |first= Rob |last= Carrick |publisher= The Globe and Mail |date= September 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea is to accept that one cannot have everything and avoid impulse buying by removing temptations which trigger overspending. This may be achieved through analysis and modification of one's personal behaviour (if you overspend on clothes, stop going to the mall and reading fashion blogs), and avoiding bad debt in the form of credit cards which carry very high interest charges, though some debt may be necessary (mortgages for example).  Ultimately, wealth depends more on savings than income. Chilton's bottom line, which is emphasized in his first book as well, is that we should all save 10-15% of our earnings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13849">In [[archaeology]] a '''typology''' is the result of the [[Categorization|classification]] of things according to their physical characteristics. The products of the classification, i.e. the classes, are also called types. Most archaeological typologies organize portable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] into types, but typologies of larger structures, including buildings, [[Ancient monument|field monuments]], [[fortification]]s or roads, are equally possible. A typology helps to manage a large mass of archaeological data. According to Doran and Hodson, "this superficially straightforward task has proved one of the most time consuming and contentious aspects of archaeological research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doran |first1=J.E. |last2=Hodson |first2=F.R. |year=1975 |title=Mathematics and Computers in Archaeology |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-250-6 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
Typology is based on a view of the world familiar from [[Plato]]'s [[metaphysics]] called [[essentialism]]. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen as a consequence of the imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.

==History==
Although the principles were not clearly articulated, the application of basic typological techniques can occasionally be found in the work of [[Early modern period|early modern]] [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]]. As early as the 1530s, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] successfully identified [[Roman brick]]s (under the misleading designation "Briton brykes") at several different sites, distinguishing them from more modern bricks by size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver |title=John Leland and the 'Briton Brykes' |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=87 |year=2007 |pages=346–56 |doi=10.1017/s0003581500000949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiquaries began to recognise in the late 16th century that medieval [[English church monuments|monumental effigies]] represented with their legs crossed were likely to be older than those with straight legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=O.D. |title=Antiquarian attitudes: crossed legs, crusaders and the evolution of an idea |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=90 |year=2010 |pages=401–40 |doi=10.1017/s0003581510000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, [[John Aubrey]] worked out crude evolutionary sequences based on typological distinctions for medieval architecture, handwriting, shield-shapes and costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Michael |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |year=1975 |pages=156–7, 162–6, 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colvin |first=H.M. |chapter=Aubrey’s 'Chronologia Architectonica' |editor-first=John |editor-last=Summerson |title=Concerning Architecture |place=London |year=1968 |pages=1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Horsfall Turner |authorlink=Olivia Horsfall Turner |title='The Windows of this Church are of several Fashions': architectural form and historical method in John Aubrey's 'Chronologia Architectonica'|journal=Architectural History |volume=54 |year=2011 |pages=171–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the development of medieval [[Gothic architecture]] was further refined in the 18th century, culminating in the clear sequence of styles published by [[Thomas Rickman]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankl |first=P. |title=The Gothic: literary sources and interpretations through eight centuries |place=Princeton |year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watkin |first=D. |title=The Rise of Architectural History |place=London |year=1980 |pages=53–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M. |title=Thomas Gray’s contribution to the study of medieval architecture |journal=Architectural History |volume=36 |year=1993 |pages=49–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries archaeological typologies continued to be constructed using a combination of empirical observation and intuition. According to Eggers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eggers |first=Hans-Jürgen |year=1986 |title=Einführung in die Vorgeschichte |place=München |publisher=Piper Verlag |pages=88–95 |ISBN=3-492-00393-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most archaeologists give [[Oscar Montelius]] the credit for the first serious application of the typological method, but in Eggers' view, his contemporary colleague from Stockholm, Hans Hildebrand made important contributions to the development of the methodology as well. Hildebrand published a fundamental paper on the development of [[fibulae]] in the 1870s using the typological method, whereas Montelius at the same time went to international congresses and published smaller papers on this method.

Another early example is the typology published in 1899 by [[Flinders Petrie]] for the objects (mainly pottery) found in 900 prehistoric Egyptian graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=D.G. |year=1971 |chapter=Seriation from abundance matrices |title=Mathematics in the Archaeological and Historical Sciences |editor1-first=F.R. |editor1-last=Hodson |editor2-first=D.G. |editor2-last=Kendall |editor3-first=P. |editor3-last=Tautu |pages=215–252 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-213-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typology formed the basis for his manual [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] of the graves.

==Statistical methods for creating a typology==
With the development of [[statistics|statistical]] techniques and numerical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including [[Cluster analysis]], [[Principal components analysis]], [[correspondence analysis]] and [[Factor analysis]]) have been used to build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spaulding, Albert C|title=Statistical Techniques for the Discovery of Artifact Types|date=1953|publisher=American Antiquity|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s [[archaeologist]]s began to use [[phylogenetic]] methods borrowed from [[Cladistics]].

==Ceramic typology==
For cultures that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably spend a great deal of time defining ceramic "types." Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.

The names assigned to the ceramic types are arbitrary. In United States, the common practice is a two-part name, the first part being an arbitrary geographic reference and the second part providing a brief description of the pottery's most obvious design attributes. Thus, for example, the type "Flagstaff Black-on-white" was first defined using a collection from the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, and its primary design attribute is the use of black paint on a white background.

Non-archaeologists should be aware of the limitations of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate.

==Non-archaeological typology as an art form==
In the middle of the twentieth century, German photographers [[Bernd and Hilla Becher]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/026202277X Bernd and Hilla Becher, ''Water Towers'', The MIT Press, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; raised typology to an art form by photographing countless similar architectural features including water towers, workers' houses and industrial landscapes. They documented their work in books.

== Types of typologies ==
''There are four main types of typologies that archaeologists organize artifacts into.''

=== Morphological/descriptive typology ===
One class of typology consists of a descriptive or [http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology a morphological] approach. It is based on the physical characteristics and the external features of an artifact. Some examples of  morphological and descriptive typologies would be categorizing artifacts distinctively on their weight, height, color, material, or whichever class the individual decides upon.

==== Projectile point typology ====
An example of morphological/descriptive typology consists of when an archaeologist excavates a site and finds dozens upon dozens of Native American arrowheads. The archaeologist narrows down their classification by organizing the pieces into morphological/descriptive groups. So, the [[projectile point]]s could be sorted by weight, height, color, material, or however the archaeologists prefers. One of the first national typology bases available on the web, [http://www.projectilepoints.net/Search/Search.html The Projectile Points Typology Database] , exhibits how the arrowhead artifacts found are classified among the fifty states by region, state, or nationwide.

In this particular example, the arrowheads are classified by their shape. The categories consist of: notched, stemmed, lanceolate, and other projectile points. Each category may also be narrowed down into subsequent ones.

=== Chronological typology ===
This type consists of sequential ordering of archaeological artifacts merely based on form. It involves collecting dates or relative dates that establishes the position in time the artifact lies in to reflect the civilization/events of a current region &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Chronology|chronological]] typology is made up of diagnostic artifacts, or relics that suggests a particular event/people occurred during a period of time &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/glossary.html|title = Glossary of Archaeology Terms|website = www.wvculture.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.jefpat.org/diagnostic/Post-Colonial%20Ceramics/PaintedWares/index-paintedwares.htm underglaze painted earthenwares] for an example of chronological typology.

=== Functional typology ===
Artifacts organized into this kind of typology are sorted by the use they serve rather than the looks they have or the chronological sequence they possess.  In some cases, the artifacts may not be removed because of the functional purpose they exhibit, and the restoration of the pieces can be more difficult than other types of objects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.venipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Functional_Artifacts|title = Functional Artifacts - Venipedia|website = www.venipedia.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stylistic typology ===
This type of classification displays information about the artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology is not to be confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. [[Pottery]] is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=abDhtdHFyCkC|title = Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality: A Dialectical Approach to Artifact Classification and Sorting|last = Adams|first = William Y.|last2 = Adams|first2 = Ernest W.|date = 2007-11-26|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521048675|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School of Chemistry is an academic unit of the [[University of Edinburgh]], in [[Scotland]], The research rating of the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] was one of the highest in the UK.&lt;ref name=RAE2008&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-2008-chemistry RAE 2008: chemistry results]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The teaching of Chemistry at Edinburgh began in 1713 when James Crawford was appointed to the Chair of Physics and Chemistry. The department has occupied many sites in its history, from a house at the top of Robertson's Close in the city centre, to purpose-built facilities in the central campus at [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College]] through to its current location at [[King's Buildings]]. Each move has brought with it expansions in size and status until the department occupied the position it does now, as one of the world's leading Chemistry [[teaching]] and [[research]] establishments.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Today the department carries on the traditions of Chemistry at Edinburgh both in teaching and research.{{cn|date=May 2015}} The collaborative research School formed with [[St Andrews University|St Andrews]] Chemistry department to form EaStCHEM has strengthened research in Scotland in the chemical sciences.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==Current==
The school has a research staff of approximately 120 individuals, and an academic staff of over 40. Current annual enrollment includes around 200 research students, and 450 taught [[postgraduate]] and [[undergraduate]] students.

EaStCHEM is the joint research school in chemistry between the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews. It has eight research groupings: Chemical Biology; Synthesis; Materials; Structural Chemistry; Chemical Physics; Biophysical Chemistry; Inorganic Chemistry; and Catalysis.

In the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2008, the most in-depth analysis of research outputs for seven years, EaStCHEM, submitted 73% of all world leading outputs (4*) in Scotland and 12% of world leading outputs in all of the UK. From 31 submissions EastChem was the largest in [[United Kingdom|UK]] Chemistry. EaStCHEM comes joint 4th in the [[Grade Point Average]] (GPA) metric, and first when staff numbers are factored in (the power ranking).{{cn|date=May 2015}}

=== Research Themes ===
The School has four major research themes as part of EaStCHEM:

The Chemistry/Biology Interface area is broad, with particular strengths in the areas of [[protein structure]] and [[Protein function|function]], mechanistic [[enzymology]], [[proteomics]], biologically targeted synthesis, the application of high throughput and combinatorial approaches and [[biophysical chemistry]], which focuses on the development and application of [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] techniques to [[biological system]]s.

Chemical Physics/Physical Chemistry is the fundamental study of molecular properties and processes. Areas of expertise include probing [[molecular structure]] in the [[gas phase]], clusters and nanoparticles, the development and application of physicochemical techniques such as [[mass spectrometry]] to molecular systems and the EaStCHEM surface science group, who study complex molecules on surfaces, probing the structure property-relationships employed in [[heterogeneous catalysis]]. A major feature is In Silico Scotland, a world class{{cn|date=May 2015}} research computing facility.

Molecular Synthesis encompasses the synthesis and characterisation at ambient and extreme conditions of organic and inorganic compounds, including those with application in homogeneous catalysis, [[nanotechnology]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[drug discovery]] and [[ligand design]]. The development of innovative synthetic and characterisation methodologies (particularly in structural chemistry) is a key feature.

The Materials Chemistry group is one of the largest materials chemistry groups in the UK. Areas of strength include the design, synthesis and characterisation of strongly correlated electronic materials, [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[fuel cell]] materials and devices, porous solids, materials at extreme pressures and temperatures, polymer microarray technologies and technique development for materials and [[nanomaterials]] analysis.
