== About ==
In 1956, the ASA presented its first annual book award, the [[Robert Morrison MacIver|MacIver]] Award. Since then, this award has gone through a number of changes, and is now known as the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Joel. 2008. "Prize Proliferation." ''Sociological Forum'' 23(1): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is currently named, the Distinguished Scholarly Book Award of the ASA was first given in 1986,&lt;ref name=ASA2014/&gt; and is presented at the ASA Annual Meeting every August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/news/asa-distinguished-book-award Harvard University Department of Sociology: ASA Distinguished Scholarly Book Award]. Accessed 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ASA Major Award, given at association-level, in contrast to the various section-level ASA awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/about/awards.cfm ASA: Major Awards]. Accessed 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominations for the award are made by members of the ASA. The Distinguished Scholarly Book Award selection committee, member terms of which last a duration of two years, chooses award recipients.&lt;ref name=ASA2014/&gt;

'''Ana Vásquez-Bronfman''' (18 December 1931 – 18 November 2009) was a [[List of Chilean Jews|Chilean Jewish]] sociologist and writer. Exiled from the country during the dictatorship in 1973, she relocated to Paris, where she worked as a professor and researcher at the [[National Center for Scientific Research]]. Much of her literary work centered on the cultural heritage of Jews in predominantly Catholic [[Latin America]], the effects of military dictatorship on human rights and racial prejudices and exile. Her research evaluated the psycho-sociology of children and women's sexuality. She won a National Book prize in Chile for her fiction and a bronze medal from the French National Center for Scientific Research for her scholarship.

==Early life==
Ana Luisa Bronfman Weinstein was born on 18 December,{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} 1931 in [[Santiago]], Chile to Ida Weinstein Rudoy and Samuel Bronfman.&lt;!-- There is a source, but we need a better one. [https://www.geni.com/people/Ida-Weinstein-Rudoy/4674370165040071872] --&gt; Her mother's family were immigrants from Ukraine{{sfn|''The New Economy''|2012}} and her father's family were immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]]. Nicha, as she was called by acquaintances,{{sfn|Olivares Palma|2010}} was influenced and shaped by being the child of [[History of the Jews in Chile|Jewish immigrants]] in the predominantly Catholic country.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} Studying psychology with a minor in French, Bronfman graduated from the [[University of Chile]].{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} She married Oscar Vásquez Pedemonte and the couple had seven children.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

==Career==
From 1967 to 1973, Vásquez-Bronfman taught at the University of Chile, as a professor in the School of Sociology.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=423}} When the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] occurred, she went into exile, fleeing to France in 1974.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} She wrote six novels, as well as several short stories, focusing her studies on exile. Working as a therapist with [[political prisoner]]s and victims of torture, her works explored the effects of politics on human rights.{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=41–42}} She studied at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], earning her PhD in psychology and upon her graduation became a researcher at the French [[National Center for Scientific Research]] from 1984 through 1998.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}}

Vásquez-Bronfman' first novels, ''Les bisons, les bonzes et le dépotoir'' (''The Bison, the Leaders, and the Rubbish'', 1977, translated into Spanish as ''Los búfalos, los jerarcas y la huesera'', 1987),{{sfn|Julien|1978}}{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=425}} ''Abel Rodríguez y sus hermanos'' (''Abel Rodríguez and his Brothers'', 1981), and ''Sebasto's Angels'' (co-written with her son Cacho Vásquez, 1985) each explored a military dictatorship through fiction.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}{{sfn|Howe|2011|p=42}} ''Les bisons, les bonzes et le dépotoir'' tells the tale of one hundred leftist refugees who had taken refuge in the French Embassy in Santiago. Ideologically linked, but differing in almost every other aspect, the book explored the limits on communication. It was selected as a book of the month by ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1978.{{sfn|Julien|1978}} ''Abel Rodríguez y sus hermanos'' deals with the fracturing of the family, and thus the nation, dividing Chilean society as brothers take opposing sides in the political climate.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1278}}{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=42–44}} The novel explores both psychological and physical torture, [[forced disappearance]], and government cover-ups.{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=58–59}}

''Sebasto's Angels'' evaluates the impact of living in dual cultural realities for second-generation immigrants with the added dimension of being exiles. The book was Vásquez-Bronfman's first novel in which the setting moved from Chile to France and her son, Óscar, known as "Cacho", who was a guitarist and singer of a [[Latin rock]] band, lends the story a more youthful focus. Vásquez deals with the pain and guilt of exile, while her son focuses on his anger, rejection politics, and his desire to live in the present moment.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Pélage|2012|pp=96–97}} It explores the stages of exile, isolation, indifference, and ultimately a loss of identification with one's place of origin, recognizing that one cannot live based on the hypothetical idea that at a future point you may be able to return.{{sfn|Pélage|2012|pp=98–99}} In her book ''Mi amiga Chantal'' (''My Friend Chantal'', 1991), Vásquez-Bronfman explores being a double exile in a fictional-autobiographical exploration of community and personal development.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1278}}{{sfn|Pélage|2012|p=100}}{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

Vásquez-Bronfman's 1999 short story ''The Sign of the Star'', retold the story of a seven-year-old child bullied by his classmates for being Jewish. She tied themes of the [[Holocaust]], such as [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghettoization]] and cremation, to the isolation the child feels when his classmates forbade others to talk with him. Drawing on her own history of being a Jew in a Catholic country, she evaluated [[Antisemitism]] from both a cultural and racial perspective.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} That same year, her ''Los mundos de Circe'' (''The World of Circe'', 1999) was awarded the Chilean National Book and Reading Council prize for best narrative.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|1999}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} The work explored shifting relationships of couples, which arise over the course of a partnership, dealing with trust given partially or fully, beauty and ugliness, and the risks that are inherent in love.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

Vásquez-Bronfman returned to the theme of her Jewishness in ''Las jaulas invisible'' (''The Invisible Cages'', 2002), evaluating women, their sexuality, and migration on the road to becoming [[mestizo]]. Set in the first half of the twentieth century, the novel tells the tale of modern daughters descended of immigrants to Chile and indigenous migrants who have moved from the countryside to the city and explores how all of them are marginalized and reshaped by their experiences.{{sfn|Cánovas Emhart|Scherman Filer|2007}}{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}} She took these themes further in a collaborative anthology, ''Crímenes de mujeres'' (''Crimes of Women'', 2004), which she edited, along with Virginia Vidal. The title referred to both crimes committed and suffered by women and evaluated the complexity of victimization, perpetration, and institutionalized power.{{sfn|Promis|2005}}

Her academic works focused on child psychology and she often evaluated the [[psychosocial]] development of children through organizations and public institutions,{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} publishing several books on the topic.{{sfn|Scemama|2017}} After her retirement from the National Center for Scientific Research in 1998, she received the center's bronze medal for research and was awarded an [[Honorary Degree]] for her research on women's sexuality.{{sfn|Des Femmes|2017}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} This last work ''Amor y sexualidad en las personas mayores: Trasgresiones y secretos'' (Love and Sexuality in the Elderly: Transgressions and Secrets, 2006) contrasted and compared the sexual experiences of twenty individuals as they aged. Subjects were from France and Spain and were an equal representation of male and female subjects. Divided into three sections, the first part of the study dealt with the socialization practices associated with sex—fears, initiation rituals, taboos—and the differences between men and women's sexuality. The second section evaluated sexuality as practiced in adulthood and the final portion analyzed the differences the group experienced in their sexuality as they aged. The research shows how childhood influences continue to be manifested in aging populations.{{sfn|Vidal Martí|2007|pp=131–132}}

==Death and legacy==
Vásquez-Bronfman died on 18 November 2009 in [[Paris]], France.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}} In February 2010, colleagues and friends gathered to celebrate her memory.{{sfn|Olivares Palma|2010}} Her works have been translated into Dutch, French and German.{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} In 2017, a literary prize for young women, known as the Ana Vasquez-Bronfman Prize, was launched to assist young writers in publishing their works.{{sfn|Scemama|2017}}

'''Aporia''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἀπορία|ᾰ̓πορῐ́ᾱ]]|aporíā|impasse, difficulty in passage, lack of resources, puzzlement}}) denotes in [[philosophy]] a philosophical puzzle or state of puzzlement and in [[rhetoric]] a rhetorically useful expression of doubt.

==Definitions==
Definitions of the term ''aporia'' have varied throughout history. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' includes two forms of the word: the adjective "aporetic", which it defines as "to be at a loss", "impassable", and "inclined to doubt, or to raise objections"; and the noun form "aporia", which it defines as the "state of the aporetic" and "a perplexity or difficulty". The dictionary entry also includes two early textual uses, which both refer to the term's rhetorical (rather than philosophical) usage.

In [[George Puttenham]]'s ''The Arte of English Poesie'' (1589), aporia is "the Doubtful, [so] called...because often we will seem to caste perils, and make doubts of things when by a plaine manner of speech we might affirm or deny [them]". In a reference from 1657, J. Smith's ''Mystical Rhetoric,'' the term becomes "a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multitude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing" (OED). [[Herbert Weir Smyth]]'s ''Greek Grammar'' (1956) also focuses on the rhetorical usage by defining aporia as "an artifice by which a speaker feigns doubts as to where he shall begin or end or what he shall do or say" (674).

More modern sources, perhaps because they come after the advent of [[post-structuralism]], have chosen to omit the rhetorical usage of the term. In [[William Harmon]]'s ''A Handbook to Literature,'' for example, aporia is identified as "a difficulty, impasse, or point of doubt and indecision", while also noting that critics such as [[Jacques Derrida]] have employed the term to "indicate a point of undecidability, which locates the site at which the text most obviously undermines its own rhetorical structure, dismantles, or deconstructs itself" (39). Julian Wolfreys, in his essay "Trauma, Testimony, and Criticism", characterizes trauma as aporia, a wound with unending trail. Valiur Rahaman, in his book  ''Interpretations: Essays in Literary Theory '' (2011), explained aporia as a creative force in both the artist and their art; it is, for the artist, an edgeless edge of the text or a work of art.

==Etymology==
The separation of aporia into its two morphemes ''a''- and ''poros'' ('without' and 'passage') reveals the word's rich [[etymological]] background as well as its connection to Platonic [[mythology]]. [[Sarah Kofman]] asserts that these two components are crucial to a fuller understanding of the word, which has been historically translated and understood somewhat reductively: "translators, who usually escape their perplexity by translating ''poros'' as 'expediency' and ''aporia'' as 'difficulty'...leave the reader in the dark as to all the semantic richness of ''poros'' and ''aporia'' and give no hint as to their links with other words belonging to the same 'family{{'"}} (9). Such links inevitably demonstrate that the terms are part of a "tradition" that [[Plato]] borrows from, a tradition which "breaks with a philosophical conception of translation, and with the logic of identity that it implies" (10). To demonstrate such a break, Kofman reviews multiple instances of the term throughout Plato's work. Her discussion of the myth of [[Porus (mythology)|Poros]], [[Penia]], and [[Eros]] in Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']] especially reveals the concept's untranslatability. Penia, the "child of poverty", decides to forcefully impregnate herself with the inebriated Poros, the personification of plenty, who is always in opposition with aporia and thus defining aporia. The result of this union is Eros, who inherits the disparate characteristics of his parents (25). The perplexing aspect of the myth is revealed as one realizes that Penia is acting out of resourcefulness, a quality normally attributed to Poros, and Poros' inaction reveals his own passivity, a poverty of agency or porous. Such a relationship intensely affects not only the context of aporia but its meaning as well: 

{{quote|Penia is no more the opposite of Poros than is the aporia; the true, philosophical aporia, or Penia, is always fertile; in her all opposites are placed under erasure; she is neither masculine nor feminine, neither rich nor poor…neither resourceful nor without resources. This is why Aporia, which breaks with the logic of identity, and which pertains to the logic of the intermediary, is an untranslatable term. (27) }}

Ultimately, aporia cannot be separated from this etymological and cultural history. Such history provides insight into aporia's perplexing semantic qualities as well as into the [[historical context]] in which the word functions as an indicator of the limits of language in constructing knowledge.

==Philosophy==&lt;!--This section is linked from 'Deconstruction'--&gt;
In philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a [[paradox]]). It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse. The notion of an aporia is principally found in [[Greek philosophy]], but it also plays a role in post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and [[Luce Irigaray]], and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in [[analytic philosophy]].

Plato's early dialogues are often called his 'aporetic' (Greek: ἀπορητικός) dialogues because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, [[Socrates]] questions his [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] about the nature or definition of a concept, for example virtue or courage. Socrates then, through [[Method of Elenchus|elenctic]] testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'' (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.

In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a [[rationalist]] inquiry that begins from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles, or an [[empiricist]] inquiry that begins from a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', he begins the ''Metaphysics'' by surveying the various ''aporiai'' that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: "with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., [[metaphysics]]], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled" (995a24). Book Beta of the ''Metaphysics'' is a list of the ''aporiai'' that preoccupy the rest of the work.

In [[Pyrrhonism]] aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing [[ataraxia]].

Contemporary academic studies of the term further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In "Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency" (2009), [[Nicholas Rescher]] is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or "apory", is intellectually processed and resolved. In the Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to "synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of 'cognitive dissonance', as it is sometimes called)" (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: "any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us" (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as "a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses", a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or "cluster of contentions":

{{quote|1. What the sight of our eyes tells us is to be believed. 
2. Sight tells us the stick is bent. 

3. What the touch of our hand tells us is to be believed. 

4. Touch tells us the stick is straight. (2) }}

The aporia, or "apory" of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a [[paradox]]). Rescher's study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.

==Rhetoric==
Aporia is also a [[rhetorical device]] whereby the speaker expresses a [[doubt]]&amp;mdash;often feigned&amp;mdash;about his position or [[rhetorical question|asks the audience rhetorically]] how he or she should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to [[discredit]] the speaker's opponent. Aporia is also called ''dubitatio''. For example:

{{quote|I am at no loss for information about you and your family; but I am at a loss where to begin. Shall I relate how your father Tromes was a slave in the house of Elpias, who kept an elementary school near the Temple of Theseus, and how he wore shackles on his legs and a timber collar round his neck? Or how your mother practised daylight nuptials in an outhouse next door to Heros the bone-setter, and so brought you up to act in [[tableaux vivants]] and to excel in minor parts on the stage?|[[Demosthenes]] ''[[On the Crown|On The Crown]]'', 129}}

'''Aidoh''' is an [[shortening]] for ''Art In Defence Of Humanism''. AIDOH was created by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]] as a [[interest group|group]] focusing on the inhuman treatment of [[people]] in different countries related to political, religious or economic interests. The group has with several occasions started a public debate about the individual countries overconsumption or governments repressive treatment of its own [[people]].

==Manifests==

===My inner beast (1993)===
[[Pigs]] in coats made of 1 ton black [[concrete]]. Is named one of the biggest art [[happening]]s in [[Europe]]. 20 sculptures were placered on public places in [[Europe]] without official approval. It took 55 hours to put the "pigs" up, and the [[happening]] created a lot of public debate.

===The silent death (1995)===
In connection with [[UN]]'s sociale [[summit]] in [[Copenhagen]], were there placed 750 dolls, that pictured dead children in the age of 3–9 years. They were placed on street lamps, benches, fountains and other places to symbolizes the 35.000 children's that dies every day in the [[world]].

===[[Pillar of Shame]] (1997)===
Were placed in [[Hong Kong]] June 4, 1997. Since it has been placed in many other places in the world where the governments does not respect the [[human right]]s. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is in copper and is 8 meters tall. It consists of more than 50 tangled human bodies in pain. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is like a [[Nobel Prize]] in injustice.

===[[WTO]] Hong Kong (2005)===
Following sculptures were placed in [[Hong Kong]] at December 2005:
* Mad Cow Disease
* The survival of the fattest
* Hunger match

===[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] (2006)===
[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] is a number of art installations, that puts focus on Catholics prohibition against the use of [[condoms]]. It consists of a crucified pregnant teenager. It has been exhibited in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Kenya]].

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Duplication|dupe=Numerical weather prediction|date=June 2016|discuss=Talk:Atmospheric model#Duplication}}
An '''atmospheric model''' is a [[mathematical model]] constructed around the full set of [[primitive equations|primitive]] [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical equations]] which govern atmospheric motions. It can supplement these equations with [[Parametrization (climate)|parameterizations]] for [[Turbulence|turbulent]] diffusion, [[radiation]], [[moist processes]] ([[clouds]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]), [[heat transfer|heat exchange]], [[soil]], vegetation, surface water, the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] effects of [[terrain]], and convection. Most atmospheric models are numerical, i.e. they discretize equations of motion. They can predict microscale phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] and [[Eddy covariance|boundary layer eddies]], sub-microscale turbulent flow over buildings, as well as synoptic and global flows. The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire [[Earth]], or ''regional'' (''limited-area''), covering only part of the Earth.  The different types of models run are thermotropic, [[barotropic]], hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic.  Some of the model types make assumptions about the atmosphere which lengthens the time steps used and increases computational speed.

Forecasts are computed using mathematical equations for the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere.  These equations are nonlinear and are impossible to solve exactly. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions.  Different models use different solution methods.  Global models often use [[spectral method]]s for the horizontal dimensions and [[Finite difference method|finite-difference methods]] for the vertical dimension, while regional models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.  For specific locations, [[model output statistics]] use climate information, output from [[numerical weather prediction]], and current [[surface weather observation]]s to develop statistical relationships which account for model bias and resolution issues.

== Types ==
The main assumption made by the '''thermotropic''' model is that while the magnitude of the [[thermal wind]] may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the [[Baroclinity|baroclinicity]] in the atmosphere can be simulated using the {{convert|500|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|1000|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[geopotential height]] surfaces and the average thermal wind between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gates|first=W. Lawrence|title=Results Of Numerical Forecasting With The Barotropic And Thermotropic Atmospheric Models|date=August 1955|publisher=Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|location=[[Hanscom Air Force Base]]|url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/AD101943|accessdate=2011-02-11}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=P.

'''Barotropic''' models assume the atmosphere is nearly [[barotropic]], which means that the direction and speed of the [[geostrophic wind]] are independent of height.  In other words, no vertical [[wind shear]] of the geostrophic wind.  It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours.  In this type of atmosphere, [[high-pressure area|high]] and [[low-pressure area|low pressure area]]s are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies.  Warm-core highs (such as the [[subtropical ridge]] and Bermuda-Azores high) and [[cold-core low]]s have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as [[tropical cyclone]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=Wallace, John M.  |author2=Peter V. Hobbs |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1977|isbn=0-12-732950-1|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|pages=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of [[atmospheric dynamics]] based on the assumption that the atmosphere is in [[geostrophic balance]]; that is, that the [[Rossby number]] of the air in the atmosphere is small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=John|title=Atmosphere, ocean, and climate dynamics : an introductory text|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-558691-7|author2=Plumb, R. Alan|pages=109–12|chapter=Balanced flow}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is [[divergence-free]], the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] reduces into the [[barotropic vorticity equation]]. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately {{convert|5.5|km|mi}} is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a [[geopotential height]] corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's {{convert|500|mb|inHg|abbr=on}} pressure surface.&lt;ref name="Charney 1950"/&gt;&lt;!-- also solved as a stream function, need to find a reference for that --&gt;

[[Primitive equations#Vertical pressure.2C Cartesian tangential plane|'''Hydrostatic''' model]]s filter out vertically moving [[acoustic wave]]s from the vertical momentum equation, which significantly increases the time step used within the model's run.  This is known as the [[hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic approximation]].  Hydrostatic models use either pressure or [[sigma coordinate system|sigma-pressure]] vertical coordinates.  Pressure coordinates intersect topography while sigma coordinates follow the contour of the land.  Its hydrostatic assumption is reasonable as long as horizontal grid resolution is not small, which is a scale where the hydrostatic assumption fails.  Models which use the entire vertical momentum equation are known as '''nonhydrostatic'''.  A nonhydrostatic model can be solved anelastically, meaning it solves the complete [[continuity equation]] for air assuming it is incompressible, or elastically, meaning it solves the complete continuity equation for air and is fully compressible.  Nonhydrostatic models use altitude or sigma altitude for their vertical coordinates.  Altitude coordinates can intersect land while sigma-altitude coordinates follow the contours of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwEf-1f73wC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=hydrostatic+model+book#v=onepage&amp;q=hydrostatic%20model%20book&amp;f=false|pages=138–143|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric modeling|author=Jacobson, Mark Zachary|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-83970-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[atmosphere]] is a [[fluid]]. As such, the idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.

A model is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes.   Within any model is a set of equations, known as the [[primitive equations]], used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined.  These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future, with each time increment known as a time step.  The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future.  ''Time stepping'' is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.  The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain [[numerical stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZikIbXzipwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=time+step+numerical+weather+prediction#v=onepage&amp;q=time%20step%20numerical%20weather%20prediction&amp;f=false|page=132|title=Computational Science – ICCS 2005: 5th International Conference, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 22–25, 2005, Proceedings, Part 1|authors=Sunderam, V.

== Parameterization ==
{{main|Parametrization (climate)}}
Weather and climate model gridboxes have sides of between {{convert|5|km|mi}} and {{convert|300|km|mi}}.  A typical [[cumulus cloud]] has a scale of less than {{convert|1|km|mi}}, and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion.  Therefore, the processes that such [[clouds]] represent are ''[[Parametrization|parameterized]]'', by processes of various sophistication.  In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) then it would be overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed.  More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might [[convection|convect]] and that entrainment and other processes occur.  Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between {{convert|5|km|mi}} and {{convert|25|km|mi}} can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they still need to parameterize [[cloud microphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/126017.pdf|title=3.7 Improving Precipitation Forecasts by the Operational Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model with the Kain-Fritsch Convective Parameterization and Cloud Microphysics|author1=Narita, Masami  |author2=Shiro Ohmori |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007-08-06|accessdate=2011-02-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|journal=12th Conference on Mesoscale Processes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of large-scale ([[stratus cloud|stratus]]-type) clouds is more physically based, they form when the [[relative humidity]] reaches some prescribed value.  Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account.  Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the [[cloud fraction]] can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for cumuliform clouds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dargan/591/diag_cloud.tech.pdf |pages=4–5 |title=The Diagnostic Cloud Parameterization Scheme |author=Frierson, Dargan |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401013742/http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dargan/591/diag_cloud.tech.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world.

The amount of solar radiation reaching ground level in rugged terrain, or due to variable cloudiness, is parameterized as this process occurs on the molecular scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMXSpRwKNO8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=radiation+mountain+parameterization+book#v=onepage&amp;q=radiation%20mountain%20parameterization%20book&amp;f=false|title=Parameterization schemes: keys to understanding numerical weather prediction models|author=Stensrud, David J.|page=6|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-86540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the grid size of the models is large when compared to the actual size and roughness of clouds and topography.

Thus, they are important to parameterize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMXSpRwKNO8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=radiation+mountain+parameterization+book#v=onepage&amp;q=radiation%20mountain%20parameterization%20book&amp;f=false|title=Parameterization schemes: keys to understanding numerical weather prediction models|author=Stensrud, David J.|pages=12–14|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-86540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domains==
The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire Earth, or ''regional'', covering only part of the Earth. Regional models also are known as ''limited-area'' models, or LAMs.  Regional models use finer grid spacing to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena, since their smaller domain decreases computational demands.  Regional models use a compatible global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain.  Uncertainty and errors within LAMs are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as within the creation of the boundary conditions for the LAMs itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RQ3dnjE8lgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=use+of+ensemble+forecasts+book#v=onepage&amp;q=use%20of%20ensemble%20forecasts%20book&amp;f=false|title=Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction|author=Warner, Thomas Tomkins |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-51389-0|page=259|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertical coordinate is handled in various ways. Some models, such as Richardson's 1922 model, use geometric height (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, in which the [[geopotential height]]s of constant-pressure surfaces become [[dependent variable]]s, greatly simplifying the primitive equations.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Peter|title=The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85729-1|pages=45–46|chapter=The Fundamental Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This follows since pressure decreases with height through the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahrens, C.

==Model output statistics==
{{Main|Model output statistics}}
Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations.

===Climate modeling===
{{Main|Climate model|General circulation model}}

In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model that realistically depicted monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere. This was the first successful [[climate model]].&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/climate/class/cm2010/Phillips_QJRMS_1956.pdf | title=The general circulation of the atmosphere: a numerical experiment | journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society]] | author=Norman A.

Cox | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | page=210 | year=2002 | isbn=0-471-38108-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several groups then began working to create [[general circulation model]]s.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch10"/&gt; The first general circulation climate model combined oceanic and atmospheric processes and was developed in the late 1960s at the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]], a component of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html | title=The First Climate Model | author=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date=22 May 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, the U.S. [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] had developed the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), which can be run by itself or as the atmospheric component of the [[Community Climate System Model]]. The latest update (version 3.1) of the standalone CAM was issued on 14 April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/description/description.pdf | title=Description of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3.0) | author=William D.

===Limited area modeling===

[[Air pollution]] forecasts depend on atmospheric models to provide [[fluid flow]] information for tracking the movement of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Alexander Baklanov | author2=Alix Rasmussen | author3=Barbara Fay | author4=Erik Berge | author5=Sandro Finardi | title=Potential and Shortcomings of Numerical Weather Prediction Models in Providing Meteorological Data for Urban Air Pollution Forecasting | journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution: Focus | date=September 2002 | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=43–60 | doi=10.1023/A:1021394126149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, a private company in the U.S. developed the regional Urban Airshed Model (UAM), which was used to forecast the effects of air pollution and [[acid rain]]. In the mid- to late-1970s, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] took over the development of the UAM and then used the results from a regional air pollution study to improve it. Although the UAM was developed for [[California]], it was during the 1980s used elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia.&lt;ref name="Steyn, D. G. 1991 241–242"/&gt;

The Movable Fine-Mesh model, which began operating in 1978, was the first [[tropical cyclone forecast model]] to be based on [[Atmospheric dynamics#Dynamic meteorology|atmospheric dynamics]].&lt;ref name="Shuman W&amp;F"/&gt; Despite the constantly improving dynamical model guidance made possible by increasing computational power, it was not until the 1980s that numerical weather prediction (NWP) showed [[Forecast skill|skill]] in forecasting the track of tropical cyclones.

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count --&gt;
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.

A '''bicycle''', also called a '''cycle''' or '''bike''', is a [[human-powered transport|human-powered]] or [[motorized bicycle|motor-powered]], [[bicycle pedal|pedal-driven]], [[single-track vehicle]], having two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. A {{vanchor|bicycle rider|BICYCLE_RIDER}} is called a [[Cycling|cyclist]], or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;
They are the principal [[means of transportation]] in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, [[Physical fitness|general fitness]], military and police applications, [[courier services]], [[bicycle racing]] and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical [[Safety bicycle|upright or "safety bicycle"]], has changed little since the first [[Chain drive|chain-driven]] model was developed around 1885.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of [[modern materials]] and [[computer-aided design]]. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of [[cycling]].

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including [[ball bearing]]s, [[pneumatic tires]], [[chain-driven sprocket]]s and [[wire wheels|tension-spoked wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;Heitmann JA. ''The Automobile and American Life''. McFarland, 2009, {{ISBN|0786440139}}, pp. 11 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bicycle'' first appeared in English print in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|bicycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The design of the bicycle was an advance on the [[velocipede]], although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bicycle |title=bicycle (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words for bicycle include "bike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|bike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pushbike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pushbike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pedal cycle",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pedal cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Unicode]], the [[code point]] for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The [[Numeric character reference|entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x1F6B2;&lt;/code&gt; in [[HTML]] produces 🚲.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F680.pdf |title=Transport and Map Symbols |publisher=unicode.org |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the bicycle}}
[[File:Draisine or Laufmaschine, around 1820. Archetype of the Bicycle. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''[[Dandy horse|draisine]]'' (around 1820), the first two-wheeler and as such the archetype of the bicycle]]
The "[[Dandy horse]]", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in [[tandem]] and was invented by the German [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]]. It is regarded as the modern bicycle's forerunner; Drais introduced it to the public in [[Mannheim]] in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818.&lt;ref name=csts&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum |title=Baron von Drais' Bicycle |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles2.cfm |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=26}} Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.&lt;ref name=csts/&gt;

[[File:Michauxjun.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Michaux's son on a velocipede 1868]]
The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]], a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=66–67}} He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a [[cycling]] traffic offense, when a [[Glasgow]] newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five [[shilling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13040607 |title=Is dangerous cycling a problem? |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen [[Pierre Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the [[velocipede]]). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall]] in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin des lois de la République française'' (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA648#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 648, patent no. 86,705: "Perfectionnements dans les roues de vélocipèdes"] (Improvements in the wheels of bicycles), issued: 4 August 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; The French ''vélocipède'', made of iron and wood, developed into the "[[penny-farthing]]" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=50}} It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor [[weight distribution]]. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the [[Hillman#History|Coventry Machinists Company]]), brought a Michaux cycle to [[Coventry]], England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner [[James Starley]], used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, David. ''A History of Coventry'' (Chichester: Phillimore, 2003), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1886 Starley 'Rover' Safety Cycle British Motor Museum 09-2016 (29928044262).jpg|thumb|1886 [[Rover Company#Before cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]] at the [[British Motor Museum]]. The first modern bicycle, it featured a rear-wheel-drive, [[chain-drive]]n cycle with two similar-sized wheels. Dunlop's [[pneumatic tire]] was added to the bicycle in 1888.]]
The ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the [[bicycle seat|seat]] further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman [[John Kemp Starley|J.K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J.H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=47}} connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as [[safety bicycle]]s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 [[Rover Company|Rover]], manufactured in Coventry&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle ''diamond frame''.

[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]
Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the first practical [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938.

[[Derailleur gears|Dérailleur gears]] and hand-operated [[Bowden cable]]-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The [[Svea Velocipede]] with vertical pedal arrangement and [[locking hubs]] was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]]. It attracted attention at the [[World Fair]] and was produced in a few thousand units.

[[File:Old CTC sign.jpg|thumb|[[Cycling UK|Cyclists' Touring Club]] sign on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]

In the 1870s many [[cycling club]]s flourished. They were popular in a time when there were not cars on the market and the principal mode of transportation was [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, such the [[horse and buggy]] or the [[horsecar]]. Among the earliest clubs was [[Cycling UK|The Bicycle Touring Club]], which has operated since 1878.
By the turn of the century, cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular. The [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] was founded in Nottingham, England in 1888. It became the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, making over two million bikes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Your Bike...|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series2/raleigh_bikes_cycling.shtml|agency=BBC|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} More than 1 billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; Bicycles are the most common [[vehicle]] of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or [[motor vehicle]], is the Chinese [[Flying Pigeon]], with numbers exceeding 500 million.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt; The next most numerous vehicle, the [[Honda Super Cub]] motorcycle, has more than 60 million units made, while most produced car, the [[Toyota Corolla]], has reached 35 million and counting.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxBusiness/&gt;

==Uses==
From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, [[bicycle commuting]], and [[utility cycling]]. It can be used as a 'work horse', used by [[Bicycle mail|mail carriers]], [[paramedic]]s, [[Police bicycle|police]], [[Bicycle messenger|messengers]], and [[Freight bicycle|general delivery]] services. Military uses of bicycles include [[Military communications|communications]], [[reconnaissance]], troop movement, supply of provisions, and [[patrol]]. See also: [[bicycle infantry]].

The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as [[bicycle touring]], [[mountain biking]], [[physical fitness]], and play. [[Cycle sport|Bicycle competition]] includes [[Road bicycle racing|racing]], [[BMX racing]], [[Track cycling|track racing]], [[criterium]], [[bicycle rollers|roller racing]], [[cyclosportive|sportives]] and [[time trial]]s. Major multi-stage professional events are the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]], the [[Vuelta a España]], the [[Tour de Pologne]], and the [[Volta a Portugal]].

Bikes can be used for entertainment and pleasure, such as in organised mass rides, [[artistic cycling]] and [[freestyle BMX]].

The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved [[bicycle safety]], and riding comfort.

===Types===
{{Main|List of bicycle types}}
Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[hybrid bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX bike]]s. Less common are [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[Lowrider bicycle|low riders]], [[tall bike]]s, [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed gear]], [[folding bicycle|folding models]], [[amphibious bicycles]], cargo bikes, [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] and [[electric bicycles]].

[[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycles]] are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".

===Dynamics===
{{Main|Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics}}
A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its [[center of mass]] over the wheels.&lt;ref name=NS2581&gt;{{cite journal

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as [[countersteering]], which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the [[hand]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book

===Performance===
{{Main|Bicycle performance}}
The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance.&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Wilson, "Bicycle Technology", ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedal power probe shows bicycles waste little energy |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1999/aug3099/30pedal.html |work=Johns Hopkins Gazette |date=August 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitt"&gt;{{cite book

In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around {{Convert|16|–|24|km/h|abbr=on|0}} uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more [[aerodynamic]]ally streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is {{Convert|144.18|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the [[carbon dioxide]] generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient motorcars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/advocacy/bike_co2.htm |title=How Much Do Bicycles Pollute?

==Parts==

===Frame===
{{Main|Bicycle frame}}

[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bicycle.]]

The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} These upright bicycles almost always feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]] consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Fork end|dropout]], where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]].]]
Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'' or as an ''open frame'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount – in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse [[sidesaddle]].

Another style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat.

Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind.{{Where?|date=August 2012}} More expensive bikes use [[carbon fibre]] due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than {{convert|1|kg|lb}}.

Other exotic frame materials include [[titanium]] and advanced alloys.

===Drivetrain and gearing===
{{Main|Bicycle drivetrain systems}}
[[File:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|A [[Shaft-driven bicycle|bicycle with shaft drive]] instead of a chain]]
[[File:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|A set of rear sprockets (also known as a cassette) and a derailleur]]
[[File:Hub gear.jpg|upright|thumb|Hub gear]]

The ''drivetrain'' begins with pedals which rotate the [[Crank set|cranks]], which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use [[hub gear]]s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the [[chainring]] and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain – popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

[[Bicycle gearing|Different gears and ranges of gears]] are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

===Steering===
[[File:Anatomic bicycle grips made of leather.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle grips made of leather. Anatomic shape distributes weight over [[hand|palm area]] to prevent Cyclist's palsy ([[Ulnar tunnel syndrome|Ulnar syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 12860549|year = 2003|last1 = Patterson|first1 = J.

I.|doi = 10.1177/03635465030310041801}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] connect to the [[Stem (bike)|stem]] that connects to the fork that connects to the front wheel, and the whole assembly connects to the bike and rotates about the steering axis via the [[Headset (bicycle part)|headset]] bearings. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

===Seating===
[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]
[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

===Brakes===
{{Main|Bicycle brake}}
[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]
Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2013/10/disc-brakes-and-road-bikes-what-does-the-future-hold/ |title=Disc Brakes and Road Bikes: What does the Future Hold? |publisher=cyclingtips.com.au |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |author=Wade Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disc brakes]] are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html |title=Disc Brakes |publisher=sheldonbrown.com |author=John Allan |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or [[hydraulic]] lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Suspension===
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

===Wheels and tires===
{{Main|Bicycle wheel|Bicycle tire}}

The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. [[Road bicycles]] use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or [[slick tire|slick]], and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between {{Convert|38|and|64|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

===Accessories===
[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders/mud-guards, water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four [[pannier]]s and a handlebar bag.]]

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. [[Mudguard]]s, or [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], protect the cyclist and [[moving parts]] from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep bicycles upright when parked, and [[bike lock]]s deter theft. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]], front or rear [[luggage carrier]]s or racks, and [[pannier]]s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]], an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. [[Training wheels]] are sometimes used when learning to ride.

[[Clipless#Clipless pedals|Toe-clips]] and toestraps and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and [[Bottle cage|cages]], and [[Bicycle bell|bell]].&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061008024853/http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html| archivedate= 8 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.

[[Bicycle helmet]]s can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse" /&gt; or as an item of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm |title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing |accessdate=2006-09-13 |work=About Bicycling |publisher=About.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060826085232/http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicycle trainer|Bike trainers]] are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycleadvisor.com/best-bike-trainer/ |title= Bicycle Advisor |publisher=bicycleadvisor.com |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a [[bicycle trailer|trailer]] for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

===Standards===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the scope of "Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability".

The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with [[List of ISO standards|ISO standards]]. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The TC149 ISO bicycle committee, including the TC149/SC1 ("Cycles and major sub-assemblies") subcommittee, has published the following standards:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* [[ISO 4210]] Cycles—Safety requirements for bicycles
* [[ISO 6692]] Cycles—Marking of cycle components
* [[ISO 6695]] Cycles—Pedal axle and crank assembly with square end fitting—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6696]] Cycles—Screw threads used in bottom bracket assemblies
* [[ISO 6697]] Cycles—Hubs and freewheels—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6698]] Cycles—Screw threads used to assemble freewheels on bicycle hubs
* [[ISO 6699]] Cycles—Stem and handlebar bend—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6701]] Cycles—External dimensions of spoke nipples
* [[ISO 6742]] Cycles—Lighting and retro-reflective devices—Photometric and physical requirements
* [[ISO 8090]] Cycles—Terminology (same as BS 6102-4)
* [[ISO 8098]] Cycles—Safety requirements for bicycles for young children
* [[ISO 8488]] Cycles—Screw threads used to assemble head fittings on bicycle forks
* [[ISO 8562]] Cycles—Stem wedge angle
* [[ISO 10230]] Cycles—Splined hub and sprocket—Mating dimensions
* [[ISO 11243]] Cycles—Luggage carriers for bicycles—Concepts, classification and testing

Other ISO Technical Committees have published various cycle relevant standards, for example:
* [[ISO 5775]] Bicycle tire and rim designations
* [[ISO 9633]] Cycle chains—Characteristics and test methods

Published cycle standards from CEN TC333 include:
* [[EN 14764]] City and trekking bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14765]] Bicycles for young children – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14766]] Mountain-bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14781]] Racing bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14782]] Bicycles – Accessories for bicycles – Luggage carriers
* [[EN 15496]] Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks

Yet to be approved cycle standards from CEN TC333:
* [[EN 15194]] Cycles—Electrically power assisted cycles ([[Electric bicycle#cite ref-15|EPAC]] bicycle)
* [[EN 15532]] Cycles—Terminology
* 00333011 Cycles – Bicycles trailers – safety requirements and test methods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance and repair==
Maintenance of adequate tire inflation is the most frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 pounds per square inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by [[goat's head]]s and other [[bur]]s, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.

Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, require considerable torque for dis-assembly and may thus need professional services. [[Self-service]] and assisted-service [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] may be available.
* Some cyclists choose self-service: they maintain their own bicycles, perhaps as part of their enjoyment of the hobby of cycling or simply for economic reasons.
* There exist several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Bicycle Organizations|url=http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community_Bicycle_Organizations|publisher=Bike Collective Network wiki|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Community Bicycle Organization, [[wikt:layperson#Noun|laypeople]] bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.
* Full service is available from [[bicycle mechanic]]s at a [[local bike shop]]. In areas where it is available, some cyclists purchase roadside assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]] or the [[American Automobile Association]].

===Tools===
[[File:Puncture-repaire-kit.jpg|thumb|Puncture repair kit with tire levers, [[sandpaper]] to clean off an area of the inner tube around the puncture, a tube of rubber solution ([[Vulcanization|vulcanizing]] fluid), round and oval patches, a metal grater and piece of chalk to make chalk powder (to dust over excess rubber solution). Kits often also include a wax crayon to mark the puncture location.]]
{{main|Bicycle tools}}

There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a [[Bicycle pump|hand pump]] or [[Bicycle pump#CO2 Inflators|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pump]], [[tire lever]]s, spare [[Inner tube|tubes]], self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing "cones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also cycling specific [[multi-tool]]s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===
Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.

In built up cities around the world, [[urban planning]] uses [[cycling infrastructure]] like bikeways to reduce [[traffic congestion]] and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3005092 | pmid=21174189 | doi=10.1007/s11524-010-9509-6 | volume=87 | issue=6 | title=Built environment influences on healthy transportation choices: bicycling versus driving | year=2010 | journal=J Urban Health | pages=969–93 | last1 = Winters | first1 = M | last2 = Brauer | first2 = M | last3 = Setton | first3 = EM | last4 = Teschke | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as [[bicycle sharing system]]s or community bicycle programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Guzman |first2=Stacey |last3=Zhang |first3=Hua |title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2143 |year=2010 |pages=159–67 |doi=10.3141/2143-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen |first=Stacey |author2=Stacey Guzman |title=Worldwide Bikesharing |journal=Access Magazine |year=2011 |url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in [[Amsterdam]] in 1965.

In [[Copenhagen]], a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/|title=Tax free bikes for work through the Government's Green Transport Initiative  |publisher=Cyclescheme}}{{psc|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are towns in some countries where [[bicycle culture]] has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of [[Ílhavo Municipality|Ílhavo]], in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a [[mixed-mode commuting|mixed-mode commute]], where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class.

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars|title=In Almost Every European Country, Bikes Are Outselling New Cars|date=24 October 2013|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/WP90BICYCLE.pdf |first=Marcia D. |last=Lowe |year=1989 |title=The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |isbn=978-0916468910}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts. An example of this is the [[Bicycle Film Festival]], a film festival hosted all around the world.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]], has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in poor nations.

===Female emancipation===

The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the [[New Woman]] of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bike boom#1890s|bicycle craze in the 1890s]] also led to a movement for so-called [[Victorian dress reform|rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and [[suffragist]]s as a "freedom machine" for women. American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on February 2, 1896:
"I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood."&lt;ref name=HustedHarper1898/&gt;{{rp|859}} In 1895 [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the tightly laced president of the [[Woman’s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote ''A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way'', a 75-page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt; Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt;

===Economic implications===
[[File:Columbia Bicycles 1886 Advertisement.svg|left|thumb|upright|[[Columbia Bicycles]] advertisement from 1886]]
[[Bicycle industry|Bicycle manufacturing]] proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[ball bearing]]s, [[washer (mechanical)|washers]], and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

[[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]], a pair of businessmen, ran the [[Wright Cycle Company]] which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and [[mass production]] (later copied and adopted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} vertical integration{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}} (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=142–47}} (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=145}} lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} all first practiced by Pope.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon. ''The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada'' (Ottawa: National Museum of Science and Technology, 1998), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; (later derided as [[planned obsolescence]], and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bicycles were an example of [[conspicuous consumption]], being adopted by the fashionable elites.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=187–88}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=208}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=243–45}} In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the [[Barbie doll]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=121}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=212}} traveling seamstresses,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=214}} riding academies,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} and racing rinks.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} Their board tracks were later adapted to early [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] and [[automobile racing]]. There were a variety of new inventions, such as [[spoke]] tighteners,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} and specialized lights,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} socks and shoes,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=125–26}} and even cameras, such as the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Company]]'s Poco.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=238}} Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the [[jock strap]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=128}}

They also presaged a move away from public transit{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=214–15}} that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the [[Rover Company]] when it started making cars. [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] (in [[Oxford]]) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers [[Ailsa Craig Engines|Ailsa Craig]], also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption.(Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. [[Ivan Illich]] stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. (1974). ''Energy and equity''. New York, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/global-cyclists-say-no-carbon-opt-cdm "Global cyclists say NO to carbon – opt for CDM"], The World Bank, 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
{{Main|Bicycle law}}
Early in its development, as with [[automobile]]s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}}

The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the [[United Nations]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflector|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a [[car horn]] can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed [[safety in numbers]] effect).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Body image''' is a person's perception of the [[aesthetics]] or [[sexual attractiveness]] of their own body. It involves how a person sees themselves according to the standards that have been set by society. The Austrian [[neurologist]] and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Paul Schilder]] coined the phrase ''body-image'' in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Schilder1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= Schilder|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Schilder|title= The Image and Appearance of the Human Body: Studies in the Constructive Energies of the Psyche|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNWxKdWhMC&amp;pg=PA17|year= 1999|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-21081-2|orig-year= 1935|p=11 | quote = The body schema is the tri-dimensional image everyone has about himself. We may call it 'body-image'.}} This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: {{cite book

[[Human society]] has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's perception of their own body may not correspond to society's standards.

The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[feminist studies]]; the media also often uses the term . Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how people view themselves in the mirror, or in their minds. It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one's own appearance, and overall attitudes towards one's height, shape, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title= What is Body Image?|publisher= National Eating Disorders Association|access-date= 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's impression of their body is also assumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.

The issues surrounding body image can be examined through body negativity and through [[body positivity]]. Negative body image consists of a disoriented view of one's shape; whereby one may often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from having low [[Self-Esteem, Self-Love|self-esteem]], sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of [[eating disorders]], isolation, and [[mental illnesses]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having a negative body-image may lead to a more serious mental illness such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]: "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their [[Body dysmorphic disorder|dysmorphic]] part on their person..."{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= May 2018}}
Positive body image on the other hand, is described as a clear true perception of one's figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual's appearance does not reflect their character or self-worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] found that a culture-wide [[sexualization]] of girls and women was contributing to increased female [[anxiety]] associated with body image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls |year= 2007 |format = PDF |publisher= American Psychological Association |url= http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian government]] [[Australian Senate committees|Senate Standing Committee]] report on the [[sexualization of children]] in the media reported similar findings associated with body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/sexualisationofchildren/report/index|title= Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media|date= June 26, 2008|publisher= Parliament of Australia |access-date= 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.&lt;ref name="tamiu"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ferguson |first= C. |author2= Winegard, B. |author3= Winegard, B.M. |title= Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal= Review of General Psychology |date= March 2011 |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi= 10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate= 2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body image can have a wide range of psychological effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people to live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many factors contribute to a person's body image; some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for [[obesity]] or [[malnutrition]], and cultural expectations (e.g., [[Media depictions of body shape|media]] and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Derenne|first= J. L.,|author2= Beresin E. V.|title= Body image, media, and eating disorders|journal= Academic Psychiatry|year= 2006|issue= 30|pages= 257–261|url= http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415161703/http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|archivedate= 2013-04-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by [[dieting]] or by undergoing [[cosmetic surgery]]. "We expected women would feel worse about their bodies after seeing ultra-thin models, compared to no models if they have internalized the thin ideal, this replicating previous findings."&lt;ref name="DittmarHoward2004"&gt;

Society often constructs our behaviors and beliefs, such as personal developments, physiological and psychological interactions, and the common "perception of our bodies as a reflection of self worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livelifegetactive.com/blog/body-image-self-esteem|title=Body image, self-esteem and the influence of society|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Live Life Get Active|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.

During [[Ancient Egyptian]] times, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rehabs.com/explore/womens-body-image-and-bmi/|title=Women's Body Image and BMI: 100 Years in the US|publisher=rehabs.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards were reformed in [[Ancient Greece]], when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With the need to reflect her husband's status, the behaviors and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset cinching the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The era also introduced the [[Gibson Girl]], which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by [[Charles Gibson]], he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were also often shown in magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the Gibson Girl transformed into the [[Flapper]], which dominated the period of the "[[Roaring Twenties]]". Women transitioned towards [[Androgyny|androgynous]] looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dress senses become more casual as well, and is said to have been a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the matron like image of the women behind the alcohol [[Prohibition]] movement in the USA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/|title=A Look Back at Beauty Through History|date=2016-05-10|publisher=Science of People|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.

The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the [[hourglass figure]], through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since this era was part of the [[Hollywood Golden Age|golden age of Hollywood]], many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. [[Pin-up girls]] and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Sophia Loren]], and [[Jessica Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Should Body-Shaming Ads Be Banned |magazine=Scholastic Choices |date=November–December 2016 |url=https://choices.scholastic.com/issues/2016-17/110116/should-body-shaming-ads-be-banned.html |pages=32(3), 2–5}}&lt;!-- Was book ref lacking URL; have I got the right ref? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] and the [[Barbie|''Barbie'' doll]] during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from 1960s onwards. The "[[Swinging Sixties]]" saw a similar look to the Flapper&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the emergence of high-fashion model [[Twiggy]], who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and an adolescent but androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This eventually resulted in an increase in [[anorexia nervosa]] sufferers during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress [[Farrah Fawcett]] introduced a more toned and athletic body type.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with [[Jane Fonda]] and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Cindy Crawford]], dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater issues arose in the 1990s, when supermodel [[Kate Moss]] popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'heroin-chic' look, which dominated the [[catwalks]] during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the [[Victoria's Secret]] models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent [[thigh gap]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, positive measures are being taken to promote a better body image such as the emergence of fitness trends and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

On account of the evolution of society today; [[text messaging]], [[e-mails]], [[social media]], and other technological advancements have dominated an individual's sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a "platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/eating-disorder/body-image-technology|title=How Technology Influences Body Image |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by ''[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'', only 4% of women thought they were beautiful,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Cindy |title=Sex, College, and Social Media: A Commonsense Guide to Navigating the Hookup Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZicxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81858-2|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dove-global-body-image-report_uk_5762a6a1e4b0681487dcc470|title=Dove's Largest Ever Body Image Report Proves The Media Needs To Up Its Game|date=2016-06-21|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]'' reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/body-image-statistics/|title=Body Image Statistics|date=2017-02-19|publisher=Statistic Brain|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Women "all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30205/1/how-should-we-tackle-fashion-s-body-image-issues|title=How should we tackle fashion's body image issues? |date=2016-03-04|publisher=Dazed|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be it [[Ageism|age]], [[Colorism|skin tone]], or [[Anti-fat bias|size]]. A large facet of "[[social currency]] for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look, social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate [[Commodification|commodity]], and used for the selling of products.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web | title = how the fashion industry affects the bodies of young women | last = Mair | first = Avril | publisher = i-D | date = November 21, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-11-16 | url = https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kybkv/how-the-fashion-industry-affects-the-bodies-of-young-women | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of many advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fueling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems are more likely to purchase their products. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|publisher=The Balance|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisements today display an image of the 'perfect' woman with an idealistic body and flawless facial features. This ideal woman creates an unrealistic image for women and puts pressure on them to live up to that certain standard. According to [[Naomi Wolf]] "our culture disempowers women by holding them prisoner to an unattainable beauty ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eating Disorders and the Role of the Media|last1=Spettigue|first1=Wendy|first2= Katherine A. |last2=Henderson|pmc=2533817|journal=The Canadian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Review|date=February 2004 |volume=13|issue=1|pp=16–19|pmid=19030149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reference various researcher's experiments in this field and the results that were found. For example, they refer to Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hargreaves|first=Duane|date=|title=Longer-term implications of responsiveness to 'thin-ideal' television: support for a cumulative hypothesis of body image disturbance?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.509/full|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=11|pages=465–477|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/erv.509|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they look at how exposure to television adverts that contain women of a thin-ideal effects the body image of the women watching them. They found that the exposure led to an increase in body dissatisfaction.

The need for body satisfaction and appearance esteem continues to increase with the abundance of [[billboards]], magazines, and conversations displaying "unrealistic images of beauty" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in the media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet''.[[Body image#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability. This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the [[mainstream media]], whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance.[[Body image#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Hence, a women's attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society's obsession with thinness.  A study was done by Rachel Cohen in 2015 to investigate if [[Facebook]] impacted the number of women experiencing body dissatisfaction, 'Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the relationship between appearance comparison and body image dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social media images, compared to conventional media images'

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a [[The Thin Ideal|damaging mentality,]] and negative habits in young, adult females.

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The ''[[National Eating Disorders Association]]'', reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperosoftware.com/uk/blog/national-eating-disorder-awareness-week-nedaw-what-you-need-to-know/|title=National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (NEDAW) {{!}} Impero|date=2016-02-22|publisher=Impero UK|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anorexia is the third most common illness among teenagers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Based on another study by ''Dove'', 87% of individuals with low body-esteems often avoid eating, and would rather place their health at risk for the sake of beauty. With the habitual use of social media, teenage girls in particular, are most prone "to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance".&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rawhide.org/blog/infographics/body-image-issues/|title=Body Image Issues: The Teen Male Edition [Infographic]|date=2016-04-26|publisher=Rawhide|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, pressures from social media doubles for adolescent girls between the ages of 13 to 18 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanavisions.com/news/world/86458-if-i-don-t-get-40-likes-on-my-selfies-my-self-esteem-plummets-the-truth-about-how-social-media-affects-teenage-girls-that-every-mother-needs-to-read-now%C2%A0.html|title='If I don't get 40 likes on my selfies my self esteem plummets': The truth about how social media affects teenage girls that EVERY mother needs to read now|publisher=Ghana Visions |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of have already reported the need to diet. The pressure on females "to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity" is therefore severe,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; with many others previously citing that "their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/body-image-concerns-men-more-than-women|title=Body image concerns more men than women, research finds|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=2012-01-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the need to be thin and young, there is also a weight prejudice within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triplett|first= L|date= May 23, 2007|title= The Blame Game: A first glimpse at the socially acceptable causes of female fatness|postscript=.

Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. Actress/comedian [[Amy Schumer]] spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in [[Glamour Magazine]] as a "Plus Size Woman".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/entertainment/amy-schumer-glamour-body-shaming-feat/index.html|title=Amy Schumer to Glamour: I'm not plus-size|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the magazines publication, Schumer posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, D., Slade, P., &amp; Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions. 	Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; unattainable. "Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality" Paraskeva et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paraskeva|first=Nicole|date=|title=Consumer opinion on social policy approaches to promoting positive body image: Airbrushed media images and disclaimer labels|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=22|pages=164–175|via=sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1359105315597052|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref name="tamiu" /&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

Women are constantly exposed to the retouched bodies of celebrities, which reflect society's ideal thin body in the media. This leads to the women developing poor self-images. Women begin to see the thin ideal body, which they see constantly in the media, as the perfect body that they should aim to achieve.&lt;ref name="GrabeWard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Shelly|last2=Ward|first2=L.

=== Men ===
Males also face similar burdens in regards to attractiveness, whereby the media's depiction of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues among young men. Teenage boys in particular, are now three times more likely to suffer from [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)]], with numbers reaching 45% since 1991.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The main causes of male body issues include 25% being teased about their weight,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A factor that affects male body image on social media sites is "celebrity involvement". Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image.&lt;ref name="HoLee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Shirley S.|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund W. J.|last3=Liao|first3=Youqing|title=Social Network Sites, Friends, and Celebrities: The Roles of Social Comparison and Celebrity Involvement in Adolescents' Body Image Dissatisfaction|journal=Social Media + Society|volume=2|issue=3|year=2016|pages=205630511666421|issn=2056-3051|doi=10.1177/2056305116664216}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others. Men may also suffer from the mental disorder bigorexia, also known as [[muscle dysmorphia]]. Sufferers of bigorexia tend to constantly chase their ideal muscular body. However, many sufferers never attain this ideal body due to never being fully satisfied with their physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women face expectations to be increasingly thin, endorsements featuring the muscular ideal therefore causes numerous problems for men. Granting both genders may share the idealised image of narrow waists and hips, other characteristics specific to the mesomorphic and muscular V-shaped body, include broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned six-pack abs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The "bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls."&lt;ref name="Adams2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/body-image-boys_n_5637975.html|title=It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-09-17|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential and that they should strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Adams2014" /&gt; A new term named 'Fitspiration' has even come into play over recent years. 'Fitspiration,' a term that combines "fitness" and "inspiration", is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food'.&lt;ref name="TiggemannZaccardo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiggemann|first1=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|title="Exercise to be fit, not skinny": The effect of fitspiration imagery on women's body image|journal=Body Image|volume=15|year=2015|pages=61–67|issn=1740-1445|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular slogan of 'Fitspiration' photos is "Strong is the New Skinny", an expression that encourages people to not be afraid of getting strong and working out.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title='Strong is the new skinny': A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|page=135910531663943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of a desire to achieve a good body and healthy lifestyle has increased in the last decade due to fitness accounts of Facebook and [[Instagram]]. Although 'Fitspiration' accounts and pictures have the intention of motivating people to pursue healthy lifestyles, they oftentimes contain objectifying elements or only show a certain body type, which can negatively affect many women's body images. For instance, 'Fitspiration' images tend to focus on specific poses or features of a woman such as washboard abs, which in turn objectifies the person.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"/&gt;

Regardless of the lower number of products targeting males, negative messages can be communicated through fitness websites, video games, pop culture, movies, and other types of media as well. Based on a report by the Picture of Health, 53% of boys cited advertisements as a "major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/News/Ads_add_to_boys_bodyimage_pressure/37212|title=Ads add to boys' body-image pressure |publisher=WARC |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% cited it was healthy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

With rising pressures to achieve a muscular physique, many teenage boys thus participate in extreme workouts and weight trainings for long periods of the day. Some eventually abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 31% have admitted to [[Purging disorder|purging]] or [[binge eating]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== The fashion industry ==
The [[fashion industry]] is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41174739|title=Dior and Gucci ban super-skinny models|date=2017-09-06|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% "felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny",&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teens, Social Media And Body Image|last=Gallivan|first=H|publisher=Park Nicollet Melrose Cente|year=2014|isbn=|location=MN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; while 46% will strive to achieve it.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing "the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/anorexia/underweight-models-french-fashion-brands|title=French Fashion Brands Are Refusing to Hire Models Under Size 2. Here's Why That's So Important|publisher=Health.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.

The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice. [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'' magazine]] in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances, leading to 69% of girls stating it influenced their ideal body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/articles/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/|title=Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising |publisher=HealthyPlace|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infographiclist.com/2012/05/18/body-culture-how-media-shapes-our-thoughts-and-ideas-about-beauty-eating-and-image-infographic/|title=Body Culture: How Media Shapes Our Thoughts and Ideas About Beauty, Eating and Image [INFOGRAPHIC]|date=2012-05-18|publisher=Infographic List|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high number of publications featuring articles promoting unhealthy weight loss, the ''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' reported an astounding 90% of teenage girls voiced the need to change their appearances,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title=What is Body Image?|publisher=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 81% of 10 year olds were already afraid of being fat.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As a result, many argue that fashion and media's powerful role on body image and self-perception, will spiral into eating disorders, According to a survey by the ''[[Manchester Metropolitan University]]'', "self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it"&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;'''.'''

According to ''Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence'' report, "a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including 'real' women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, "body [[fascism]] is [still] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.

Less is usually known about the pressures models in the industry face, but striving hard to meet the requirements of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/02/fashion-week-brings-questions-about-body-image-front-and-center/|title=Fashion Week brings questions about body image front and center|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Another 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) level. A study published in the [[International Journal of Eating Disorders]], discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; which qualifies for anorexia.

In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was ecorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; [[Luisel Ramos]], and [[Ana Carolina Reston]]. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, a high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, [[Fasting|fasts]], and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
{{See|Body image law}}

With the aim of protecting models and projecting a healthier body image, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Israel]], passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer Rayne|date=2013-05-22|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models,&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and the need for a medical certificate to verify their health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/france-laws-thin-models-retouched-photographs|title=Digital fakery?

Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; ''[[Kering]]'' and ''[[LVMH]]'', recently "announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This Isn't the Answer to Fashion's Body-Image Issues|publisher=Racked|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to "send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lvmh-kering-pledge_uk_59b0f9d7e4b0354e440f56c9|title=Will French Fashion Brands' Ban On Size Zero And Underage Models Really Make A Difference?|date=2017-09-07|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributable to the level of interest in women who do not match the proportions of average models, [[plus-size model]]s are slowly emerging in the mainstream media. With several utilising their positions to promote body positivity, their continued presence in the industry, undoubtedly reign beneficial to the health of other models and customers. Health reporter Philippa of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29569473|title=Does social media impact on body image?|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2014-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[BBC News]] discusses how the introduction of more diversity upon body images can be a helpful factor into improving self-confidence for all body types. Prominent names include [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]]; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer ''[[Lane Bryant]]'', and [[Iskra Lawrence]]; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer ''[[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]''. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]].&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Real Women Have Curves |last=Bazilian |first=Emma |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=April 25, 2016 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA451229452&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=d7d9761b9b364c6d5dbff6ac2a615991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=Article says attention was national not worldwide}}

Fashion designers are also strong supporters for embracing diversity and healthy body ideals in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week-ashley-graham-candice-huffine-kelly-slater-itsnotok-teatum-jones-disabled-body|title=News Bites {{!}} NYFW Gets Real About Plus-Size, Kelly Slater Says #itsnotok and More...|date=2017-02-16|publisher=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Christian Siriano]]'' specifically, shocked the fashion world by casting five plus-size models for his [[New York Fashion Week]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onbreaking.com/entertainment/interview-with-christian-siriano-about-his-runway-show-with-plus-size-models/2752/|title=Christian Siriano talk about Plus Size Models|date=2016-09-14|publisher=On Breaking|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the box-office success of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for actress [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], because no one else would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/style/christian-siriano-confirms-that-leslie-jones-is-a-pretty-woman-at-the-ghostbusters-premiere/|title=Christian Siriano Confirms that Leslie Jones Is a Pretty Woman at the Ghostbusters Premiere|date=2016-07-10|work=People |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high number of plus-size models dominated the runways this year, print advertisements saw a decrease, with only 2.2% casted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/762095-diversity-report-fall-2017-ad-campaigns/|title=Diversity Report: The Fall 2017 Ads Were More Inclusive Than the Runways for the First Time Ever|date=2017-08-29|publisher=theFashionSpot|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used ''Instagram'' as a tool to "encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the ''#DearNYFW'' campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/started-breaking-ribs-fashion-week-models-hit-back-against-pressure/|title='I started breaking my ribs': Fashion week models hit back against the pressure to lose weight|last=Rahim|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start "prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway".&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer [[Tarik Carroll]] released a photo series titled the ''EveryMAN Project''. The project showcased large-framed [[queer]] and [[transgender men]] of color, with the purpose of "challenging [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] and [[gender norms]], while bringing body-positivity to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fashion-photographer-promotes-acceptance-everyman-n783881|title=Fashion photographer promotes acceptance of "EveryMAN"|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry on the other hand, has given rise to the ''#PlusIsEqual'' movement. There was often a misconception by retailers that full-figured women{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} were not interested in purchasing trendy styles. However, high-street brands such as [[Forever 21]], and [[ASOS.com|ASOS]], have increased product offerings to include plus-size options for their customers.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/marketing/loud-proud-social-media-pushed-retail-body-positive/|title='Loud and proud': How social media pushed retail to be more body-positive - Digiday|date=2016-02-25|publisher=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other brands include, ''[[Victoria Beckham]]'' who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL in the upcoming months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/the-beauty-curve-here-s-how-the-fashion-industry-embraced-plus-sizes/story-A3zwYFeeZIMAsTs1vQWEpK.html|title=The beauty curve: Here's how the fashion industry is embracing plus sized clothes|date=2017-07-12|work=Hindustan Times |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'' who expanded their plus size collection to cater for sizes 1X to 3X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nike-plus-size-range-xl-xxxl-body-positive-sportswear-clothing-a7609341.html|title=Nike has finally launched its first plus size range|date=2017-03-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the criticisms surrounding the term plus-size causing unnecessary labeling, ''[[Kmart]]'' therefore replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, "lovely" and "fabulous" instead.&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nosizefitsall-the-rise-of-body-positive-fashion.html|title=#NoSizeFitsAll: The rise of body-positive fashion|publisher=Cafe Babel|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesting against photo retouching is another important aspect towards body positivity, with the most famous example being Aerie's ''ArieReal'' campaign. Since 2014, the movement promised to display "campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Other brands such as ''Neon Moon'', which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of "diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool".&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll" /&gt; U.S. e-tailer ''[[ModCloth]]'' on the other hand, explored other methods including, employing their staff as models for the swimwear collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/style/modcloth-proves-we-all-have-swimsuit-bodies-new-body-positive-t90081|title='We all have swimsuit bodies': See Modcloth's empowering new campaign|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=Today |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
In the past, exposure to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, the accessibility of the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which "force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before".&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://verilymag.com/2017/03/body-image-beauty-standards-media|title=Here's How Body Image Issues Can Affect You (Even if You Don't Have an Eating Disorder)|publisher=Verily|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, is the creation of [[social media]]. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; "sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, "the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment."&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2017-Media-Releases/The-beauty-myth-puts-big-users-of-social-at-risk-of-low-self-esteem-media/|title=The beauty myth puts big users of social media at risk of low self-esteem |publisher=University of South Austalia |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also "encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2016, psychologists confirmed the relationship between social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged the effect of the "social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image";&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107683/female-body-image-statistics-2016|title=This Is How Women Actually Feel About Their Bodies|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another study by the ''[[University of South Australia]]'', discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Applications such as ''Instagram'' have become a "body-image battleground",&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; while the "selfie" is now the universal lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; ''Facebook'' and ''[[Snapchat]]'' also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by ''[[Common Sense Media|Common Sense]]'' reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if it did not receive the amount of attention they hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image |author=Caroline Knorr |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos in order to meet the media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the ''[[Renfrew Center Foundation]]'', 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/friends-pictures-on-social-media-biggest-impact-body-image|title=Friends' pictures on social media have biggest impact on body image|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=2017-03-05|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-11-01 |issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.

With the growth of the wellness industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of [[Fitness culture|fitness]] influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these [[bloggers]] and companies have received numerous criticism because the "drive for 'wellness' and 'clean eating' has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/|title=How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror|work=Time|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by "fitspiration" websites are sometimes identical to the "thinspiration" or pro-anorexia types.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jm5nvp/ruby-tandoh-eat-clean-wellness|title=The Unhealthy Truth Behind 'Wellness' and 'Clean Eating'|date=2016-05-13|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident through "language inducing [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about weight or the body, and promoted dieting".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause "increasingly [[disordered eating]]",&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as [[Orthorexia nervosa|Orthorexia]]; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
As an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called ''Be Real,'' after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://academytoday.co.uk/Article/almost-a-third-of-11-16-year-olds-have-body-image-anxiety|title=Almost a third of 11-16 year-olds have body image anxiety|publisher=Academy Today|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual's body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial.

Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed as a tool to share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular [[hashtag]]s and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.

In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as ''Instagram'', have banned the use of '''thinspiration''' and '''thinspo''' related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of hashtags such as ''#SelfLove'' and ''#BodyPositivity''&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.self.com/story/side-by-side-photos|title=20 Side-by-Side Photos That Show How Misleading Social Media Can Be|last=Lanquist|first=Lindsey|work=Self |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Transformation photos are side-by-side images displaying an individual's fitness or weight-loss progress. Although, it aims to "serve as inspiration for people looking to change themselves physically or live healthier lives",&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; some users have utilised this technique to showcase the level of deceptiveness within social media. Likewise, in an effort to actively help those suffering from eating disorders, ''[[Eating Disorder Hope]]'' launched the ''Pro-Recovery'' ''Movement''. The project involved hosting of live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/positive-uses-social-media-body-image-advocacy|title=Positive Uses of Social Media in Body Image Advocacy |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations such as [[Project HEAL|ProjectHEAL]], introduced a campaign called ''#WhatMakesMeBeautiful'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clementine-desseaux/what-makes-me-beautiful-heal-project_b_9287398.html|title=#WhatMakesMeBeautiful Campaign With Heal Project|date=2016-02-22|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of celebrating different talents, personalities, and other non-appearance related attributes that also make one beautiful.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; This movement was especially successful among the eating disorder community; hence, emphasising the "need for social media movements that celebrate self-love and looking at beauty through a different lens".&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;
[[Celebrity culture]] is known as one of the main influences on body image for this generation. Studies in this area have been carried out with the majority proving that viewing media images affects participants abilities to correctly estimate the size and parts of their own bodies. We are subjected to [[PhotoShop|photoshop]] so often when they were shown a range of photos of famous celebrities the women with body dissatisfaction consistently choose the photos of the celebrity being photoshopped to look skinnier than the original.{{Ambiguous|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="KingTouyz2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Natalie|last2=Touyz|first2=Stephen|last3=Charles|first3=Margaret|title=The effect of body dissatisfaction on women's perceptions of female celebrities|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=27|issue=3|year=2000|pages=341–347|issn=0276-3478|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(200004)27:3&lt;341::AID-EAT12&gt;3.0.CO;2-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

Body image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in girls can have many negative effects, including an increased rate of [[smoking]] and a decrease in comfort with [[sexuality]] when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.{{efn|An increase in women's weight dissatisfaction is found when women see idealized images of women viewed as passive sexual objects or angelic sexual subjects.{{cite journal|last1=Halliwell|first1=Emma|last2=Malson|first2=Helen|last3=Tischner|first3=Irmgard|title=Are Contemporary Media Images Which Seem to Display Women as Sexually Empowered Actually Harmful to Women?|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=35|issue=1|year=2011|pages=38–45|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1177/0361684310385217}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Healthy body image: tips for guiding girls.|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|publisher=MayoClinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a [[Dieting|diet]] or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become a very common thing to not only teenage girls but even younger children as well. The [[National Eating Disorders Association]] has found out that 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls actually feel better about themselves when they are on a diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nault|first=Kelly|title=How the Media Affects Teen Girls|url=http://www.insteadoftv.com/how-the-media-affects-teen-girls.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 40 "instruments" used to measure body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=J. K.|last2=Altabe|first2=M.|last3=Johnson|first3=S.|last4=Stormer|first4=S.

Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it makes it difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, [[ethnicity]], culture, and age.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullari|first=S.,|author2=Vosburgh, M.|author3=Shotwell, A.|author4=Inzodda, J.|author5=Davenport, W.|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided measurement technique.|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2002|issue=4(2)|pages=221–232|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2002-17480-006&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figure preferences ===

In figure preferences the use of silhouettes is the most commonly used method. [[Silhouette]]s can be defined by a figures shape or dark outline upon a lighter background. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are not realistic looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"/&gt; Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=1d539162-5f98-4f55-bcb2-3670ba57a382@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided meas...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Photoshop to fit their personal preference upon their body image, altering body tones, shape or size.

=== Video projection techniques ===

In one study participants were shown a series of images flashing before them; each image was a picture of them but either increased weight or decreased weight. They were measured in self-report by responding to the pictures. Also they were measured by startle-based measures and testing their eyeblink response.

=== Questionnaires ===

Questionnaires are another very commonly used method of measurement. One example of a questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, [[muscle tone]], height, and weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giovannelli|first=Thorayya Said|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Henson|first3=James M.|last4=Engle|first4=Erin K.|date=2008-06-01|title=The measurement of body-image dissatisfaction-satisfaction: is rating importance important?|journal=Body Image|volume=5|issue=2|pages=216–223|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.01.001|issn=1873-6807|pmid=18463010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can have confounding variable though.

== Gender differences ==

Gender differences related to body image are increasingly prevalent between men and women. Although dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body image perceptions: Do gender differences exist? | journal = Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research | year = 2010 | first = Maggie A. | last = Brennan |author2=Christopher E.

[[Adolescence]] is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=David|author2=Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|author3=Marita P.

Men's body image is a topic of increasing interest in both academic articles and in the popular press.&lt;ref name="Frank 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Frank | first=Priscilla | title=A Woman Photographed 500 Naked Men To Normalize The Nude Male Body | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=August 2, 2016 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nude-photos-normalize-male-body_us_579fac86e4b08a8e8b5eff23 | accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research indicates many men wish to become more muscular than they currently perceive themselves to be, often desiring up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. According to the study, western men desire muscle mass over that of Asian men by as much as 30 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Pope|first1=Harrison|last2=Phillips|first2=Katharine A. |last3=Olivardia|first3=Roberto |title=The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jo-LHyyIy_kC&amp;pg=PA27|year=2000|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-86910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for additional muscle has been linked to many men's concepts about [[masculinity]].

Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of [[Human Physiology|human physiology]]. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced as far back as the Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sideris |first=A.|url=https://www.academia.edu/481380/The_Athletic_Body_Image_and_Power=|title=The Athletic Body: Image and Power|journal=Imeros|volume=5|issue=1|year= 2005|pages= 287–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men with lower, more feminine, [[Waist–hip ratio]] (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pazhoohi| first1=Farid| last2=Hosseinchari|first2=M.|last3=Doyle|first3=J.

In general, research shows that body image in regards to appearance becomes less of a [[Psychological stress|stress]] for women as they age. Studies show a decline in dissatisfaction of body image in college-aged women as they progress from the first semester of college to subsequent semesters. Their appearance rating of themselves tends to increase, while males' do not significantly change and often become worse. This suggests that the early years of [[college]] serve as a period for body image development, which can later affect the mental and physical well being of an individual.&lt;ref name='PsycInfo 2011-30272-014'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender and racial/ethnic differences in body image development among college students | journal = Body Image | date = January 2012 | first = Meghan M. | last = Gillen |author2=Eva S.

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning.  Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2011-30272-014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body dissatisfaction and perceived sociocultural pressures | journal = Salud Mental | date = February 21, 2010 | first = Igor | last = Esnaola |author2=Arantzazu Rodríguez|author3=Alfredo Goñi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9| id =  | type =  PDF | accessdate = 2012-06-26 |url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v33n1/v33n1a3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical appearance remains important later in life, but the functional aspects of the body take precedence over contentment with appearance.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"/&gt; Women are reported to benefit from the [[Ageing|ageing process]], becoming more satisfied with their images, while men begin to develop more insecurities and issues.  Women reach a certain stage where they are no longer subject to the social pressures that heavily emphasize the importance of appearance.  Men from the same studies are reported as becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their physical appearance as they age. Men are also less likely to implement appearance-enhancing activities into their daily lives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The older women become the more satisfied with their body image they are likely to become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2009-11492-005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Lucie|author2=Eyal Gringart|date=August 2009|title=Body image and self-esteem in older adulthood|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|type=PDF|volume=29|issue=6|pages=977–95|doi=10.1017/S0144686X09008721|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older men become, the more dissatisfied they are likely to become due to increased physical and perceived incompetency.

Adrienne Adams and Eaaron Henderson-king claim that the rates of cosmetic surgery have increased in recent years. It has been proven that the majority of people that undergo cosmetic surgery is a highly gendered activity. However, rates are increasing for men. it is predominantly women who spend more time attending to their to their bodies. Cosmetic surgery was initially developed largely in response to the reconstructive needs of wounded soldiers, but it is now primarily used in a much more feminine way to improve people's physical appearance and attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance messages AND Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weight ==

{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight. Kashubeck-West ''et al.'' reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashubeck-West S, Mintz LB, Weigold I |title=Separating the Effects of Gender and Weight-Loss Desire on Body Satisfaction and Disordered Eating Behavior |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=7–8, |pages=505–518 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7138-4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/y07h74u11ug0x245/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] reported that "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991 /&gt; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As [[Charisse Goodman]] put it in her article, "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: "Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body size was larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Martin Brett A.

Many, like journalist [[Marisa Meltzer]], have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: "Never before has the 'perfect' body been at such odds with our true size."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |authorlink=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty are Used Against Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgfokiNQl0sC|year=1991|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-986190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Marisa.

However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

Research by [[The Lancet Psychiatry|The Lancent Psychiatry]] discusses the relationship between mass media and eating disorders stating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Emilio|last2=Carrera|first2=Olaia|date=February 2016|title=Anorexia nervosa and body-image disturbance|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00581-7/fulltext|journal=The Lancet Psychiatry|language=English|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e9–e10|doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00581-7|issn=2215-0366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Body-image disturbance and weight and shape concerns are the result of an acculturation process spread through the therapeutic milieu and the mass media." The struggles caused by body imaging have led to the increase of Anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that results in significant weight loss due to a persons own distorted body image. Its increasing rate shows the correlation between the effects body imaging through social media has on people especially upon women and how it effects the measures of weight loss.

Post-1997 studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Obesity Statistics: U.S. Obesity Trends|url = http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|publisher = North American Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate = 2008-03-08|year = 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206185213/http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|archivedate = 2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their body but are not.

In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's ''positive'' effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an "[[obesity epidemic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics Related to Overweight and Obesity|url = http://www.win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|year = 2006|accessdate = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mxm007v1|title = The obesity epidemic in the United States—gender, age, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic characteristics: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis|last1 = Wang|first1 = Youfa|last2 = Beydoun|first2 = May A|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|year = 2007 |doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm007|pmid = 17510091|volume = 29|pages = 6–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be even more severe than they already are.&lt;ref name="ThompsonHeinberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

[[Miss Representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis. (January 1, 2014). Retrieved May 5, 2014, from http://film.missrepresentation.org/synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], exploring and displaying the role that mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting the lives of people from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.

The 2007 documentary [[America the Beautiful (film)|America the Beautiful]] explores how the fashion and beauty industries are contributing to the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses a wide range of topics like [[plastic surgery]], dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young [[Middle school|middle-school]] aged girls were portrayed in the beginning of the film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/america-the-beautiful-a-problem-of-self-image/82590/|title='America the Beautiful': A Problem of Self-Image|last=Snyder|first=S.

In a study performed by Leslie J. Heinberg of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], and J.

In a study done at [[Old Dominion University]], Thomas F. Cash, [[Julie Ancis|Julie R. Ancis]] and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist identity and body image. "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image [[dysphoria]] in women's daily lives."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Ancis | first2 = J.

Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]], body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.

In the same study from [[Arizona State University]], it was said that the idea of beauty is generated from these media messages. "Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women."&lt;ref name="Rubin, L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = L | year = 2004 | title = Exploring Feminist Women's Body Consciousness | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study from Old Dominion University, the authors state the importance of research in this area. "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and sub clinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; Even though there is research being done, there is still much more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.

The link between body image and eating disorders is becoming increasingly prominent in the younger generations as the growth of social media and social influencers inhibits their perspective on their own bodies.&lt;ref name="NaeimiHaghighian2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeimi|first1=Alireza Farsad|last2=Haghighian|first2=Hossein Khadem|last3=Gargari|first3=Bahram Pourghassem |last4=Alizadeh|first4=Mohammad|last5=Rouzitalab|first5=Tohid|title=Eating disorders risk and its relation to self-esteem and body image in Iranian university students of medical sciences|journal=Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity|volume=21|issue=4|year=2016|pages=597–605|issn=1124-4909|doi=10.1007/s40519-016-0283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat unhealthy body image issues among women, in 2015, [[France]] passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. It also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Willsher (December 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/models-doctors-note-prove-not-too-thin-france Models in France must provide doctor's note to work], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight- The Psychosocial burden of childhood overweight and Obesity:
Children also have a hard time dealing with 'body image' and can face discrimination. According to (''[[European Journal of Pediatrics]]'' 2017 ) 
According to research, It has shown that the psychological, social and behavioral consequences of childhood obesity shows that children who are overweight experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, [[social isolation]] and depression.

== Race ==
Perceptions of races have drastically changed over the years dating all the way back to the [[medieval era]] referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which left ideas of idealism for [[White people|Caucasians]] and a negative idea of any other race. [[White nationalism|Caucasian nationalists]] such as Goldstein also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/graywhite1e/#t_823553____|title=Freedom on my mind: A history of African Americans|last=Bay|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins |year=2013|last1=|first1=Mia|accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and [[African people|African]] difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camp|first1=Stephanie|title=Black Is Beautiful: An American History|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=April 2015|volume=3|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the [[Black is Beautiful]] movement and [[Black Power]] movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.

The [[fashion industry]] is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214658/http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-12-10|title = The Beauty Ideal: The Effects of European Standards of Beauty on Black Women|last = Bryant|first = Susan L|date = n.d.|journal = Columbia Social Work Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive [[white people|white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/racialminorities-SAI-2003.pdf|title = Do Racial Minorities Respond in the Same Way to Mainstream Beauty Standards?

[[Weight loss]] is one such method. For instance, [[Mexican American]] women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the [[White normalcy|white norm]]. In spite of the fact that certain ethnicities naturally have different body types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/race-is-part-of-the-body-image-conversation-so-why-dont-we-talk-about-it-8600605.htm|title = Race is part of the body image conversation, so why don't we talk about it?|date = May 2, 2013|accessdate = October 25, 2015|newspaper=The Independent |last = Devon|first = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst [[Latino|Latinas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Beauty Whitewashed: How White Ideals Exclude Women of Color |url = http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|publisher = Beauty Redefined |accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306151312/http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|archivedate = 2011-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastic surgery]] is another method, and is especially popular in Asia for "[[Westernization|Westernizing]]" facial features. Two of the most popular treatments are [[rhinoplasty]] (nose lifts), and [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid lifts), which are done to make these features look more Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin-lightening|Skin lightening]] products are also prevalent in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In [[Racism in India|India]] alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url = http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/market-trends/skin-lightening-trend-in-asia-boosts-global-market|publisher = CosmeticsDesign-Asia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of these whitening cosmetics are known to have dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; [[hydroquinone]], for instance, is known to cause irritation and [[leukemia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is known to cause [[rash]]es and pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bob Fredericks |title=Health officials warn of mercury levels in skin-lightening creams |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/06/health-officials-warn-of-mercury-levels-in-skin-lightening-creams/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly "whitewashed" – with digitally lightened skin and hair – or may already have features that are considered "white").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fashion industry believes that by advertising unattainable standards of beauty, they fuel a customer demand by "creating a craving that can't be satisfied".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can using different types of models benefit brands?|url = http://www.ellecanada.com/living/culture/can-using-different-types-of-models-benefit-brands/a/58327 |publisher = Elle Canada|accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by [[Elle Canada]] has proven the exact opposite: products featured by models that accurately represent the consumer's race – as well as weight and age – will increase the consumer's willingness to purchase a product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Classical physics''' refers to theories of [[physics]] that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be modern, and its introduction represented a major [[paradigm shift]], then the previous theories, or new theories based on the older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the realm of "classical physics".

As such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily complex for a particular situation. Most usually ''classical physics'' refers to pre-1900 physics, while ''[[modern physics]]'' refers to post-1900 physics which incorporates elements of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner and Sells, ''Elementary Modern Physics'' Preface p.iii, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{Classical mechanics}}
Classical theory has at least two distinct meanings in physics. In the context of [[quantum mechanics]], classical theory refers to [[theory|theories]] of physics that do not use the [[Quantization (physics)|quantisation]] [[paradigm]], which includes [[classical mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morin |first=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780521876223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[classical field theories]], such as [[general relativity]] and [[classical electromagnetism]], are those that do not use quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barut |first=Asim O. |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=1980| origyear=1964 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |location=New York |isbn= 9780486640389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of general and special relativity, classical theories are those that obey [[principle of relativity|Galilean relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Einstein|others= Robert W. Lawson |title=Relativity|year=2004|origyear=1920|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=9780760759219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on point of view, among the branches of theory sometimes included in classical physics are variably:

* [[Classical mechanics]]
** [[Newton's laws of motion]]
** Classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalisms
* [[Classical electrodynamics]] ([[Maxwell's Equations]])
* Classical [[thermodynamics]]
* [[Special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]
* Classical [[chaos theory]] and [[nonlinear dynamics]]

==Comparison with modern physics==
In contrast to classical physics, "[[modern physics]]" is a slightly looser term which may refer to just [[quantum physics]] or to [[History of physics#20th century|20th and 21st century physics]] in general.  Modern physics includes [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]], when applicable.

A physical system can be described by classical physics when it satisfies conditions such that the laws of classical physics are approximately valid. In practice, physical objects ranging from those larger than [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, to objects in the macroscopic and astronomical realm, can be well-described (understood) with [[classical mechanics]]. Beginning at the atomic level and lower, the laws of classical physics break down and generally do not provide a correct description of nature. Electromagnetic fields and forces can be described well by classical electrodynamics at length scales and field strengths large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. Unlike quantum physics, classical physics is generally characterized by the principle of complete [[Scientific determinism|determinism]], although deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics do exist.

From the point of view of classical physics as being non-relativistic physics, the predictions of general and special relativity are significantly different than those of classical theories, particularly concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Traditionally, light was reconciled with classical mechanics by assuming the existence of a stationary medium through which light propagated, the [[luminiferous aether]], which was later shown not to exist.

Mathematically, classical physics equations are those in which [[Planck's constant]] does not appear. According to the [[correspondence principle]] and [[Ehrenfest's theorem]], as a system becomes larger or more massive the classical dynamics tends to emerge, with some exceptions, such as [[superfluidity]]. This is why we can usually ignore quantum mechanics when dealing with everyday objects and the classical description will suffice. However, one of the most vigorous on-going fields of research in physics is [[Decoherence#Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical|classical-quantum correspondence]]. This field of research is concerned with the discovery of how the laws of quantum physics give rise to classical physics found at the limit of the large scales of the classical level.

==Computer modeling and manual calculation, modern and classic comparison== 
[[File:The two physic theories without refutation at the moment.jpg|thumb|350px|A computer model would use quantum theory and relativistic theory only]] 
Today a computer performs millions of arithmetic operations in seconds to solve a classical [[differential equation]], while Newton (one of the fathers of the differential calculus) would take hours to solve the same equation by manual calculation, even if he were the discoverer of that particular equation.

Computer modeling is essential for quantum and relativistic physics. Classic physics is considered the limit of quantum mechanics for large number of particles. On the other hand, [[classic mechanics]] is derived from [[relativistic mechanics]]. For example, in many formulations from special relativity, a correction factor (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; appears, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. For velocities much smaller than that of light, one can neglect the terms with c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and higher that appear. These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities. Computer modeling has to be as real as possible.  Classical physics would introduce an error as in the [[superfluidity]] case. In order to produce reliable models of the world, we can not use classic physics.  It is true that quantum theories consume time and computer resources, and the equations of classical physics could be resorted to provide a quick solution, but such a solution would lack reliability.

Computer modeling would use only the energy criteria to determine which theory to use: relativity or quantum theory, when attempting to describe the behavior of an object. A physicist would use a classical model to provide an approximation before more exacting models are applied and those calculations proceed.

In a computer model, there is no need to use the speed of the object if classical physics is excluded.  Low energy objects would be handled by quantum theory and high energy objects by relativity theory.&lt;ref name="zurek03"&gt;Wojciech H.

'''Clothed female, naked male''' ('''CFNM'''), or '''clothed male, naked female''', is a genre of [[erotica]] based on the real or imagined interaction of one or more [[nudity|nude]] men and one or more clothed women.  It is sometimes a [[sexual fantasy]] of women or men, depicting an  [[exhibitionist]] or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male [[striptease]], a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as  a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a [[dominatrix]] over the nude male.

The opposite of CFNM is [[clothed male, naked female]] (CMNF).

==Portrayal of male nudity==
[[File:Torii Kiyonobu I -By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern early 1700s.jpg|thumb|''By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern'', woodblock print by [[Torii Kiyonobu I]], early 1700s.]]

[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs, 1846.jpg|thumb|''Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1846).]]
In [[classical antiquity]], the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed.&lt;ref name="Goldhill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Love, sex &amp; tragedy how the ancient world shapes our lives |author=Simon Goldhill |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-30119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|treatment of Perseus and Andromeda]]'' in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour.

Depictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] culture if the setting was clearly "classical", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in ''Combat de coqs'' (1847) by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]].

== Sexual objectification of men by women ==
[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] have written that women's sexual liberation has led many women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they view men as [[sex object]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994. ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]''. New York. Simon and Schuster (pp.264-265), {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hc), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. 1994. ''Fire With Fire: The New Female Power and How to Use It''. New York: Fawcett Columbine (pp.225-228), {{ISBN|0-449-90951-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Tad. ''Yes (feminist women who like sex)'' Esquire. February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to what they criticize in men's treatment of women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''. New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015. The case for addressing gender and power in sexuality and HIV education: A comprehensive review of evaluation studies. ''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a. ''School-Based Sexuality Education Programmes. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in six countries''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/CostingStudy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014. ''Interventions to enhance girls’ education and gender equality''. Education Rigorous Literature Review. London, Department for International Development. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://r4d.d&lt;/nowiki&gt; d.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/HumanDev_evidence/Girls_Education_Literature_ Review_2014_Unterhalter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a necessary skill for delaying the age that young people first engage in sexual intercourse, and for using contraception, including condoms. CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

'''David Lawrence Ramsey III''' (born September 3, 1960) is an American businessman and author.

==Biography==
Ramsey was born and raised in [[Antioch, Tennessee]]. He was a 1982 graduate of the College of Business Administration at [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]] with a degree in Finance and Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Dave Ramsey?|url=https://www.daveramsey.com/pr/who-is/|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a real estate investor, doing business as  Ramsey Investments, Inc., he built a rental real estate portfolio worth more than $4 million by 1986.&lt;ref name="GRI"&gt;{{cite book | title=Financial Peace Revisited| last=Ramsey| first=Dave|author2=Sharon Ramsey| year=2003| page=325| publisher=Viking Penguin| location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England| id=0-670-03208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank that was financing his real estate was sold to a larger bank who demanded immediate repayment on the loans. He was unable to pay, and eventually filed bankruptcy in September 1988.

After recovering financially, Ramsey began counseling couples at his local church. He attended workshops and seminars on consumer financial problems. Ramsey developed a set of lessons and materials based partially on his own experience and partially on works and teachings by [[Larry Burkett]], Ron Blue and Art Williams of the [[Arthur L. Williams Jr.|A.L. Williams]] company, now [[Primerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneplace.com/Ministries/Focus_on_the_Family/Archives.asp?bcd=2008-4-3|title=Broadcast Archives - Jim Daly, Focus on the Family|website=oneplace.com|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 he wrote his first book, ''Financial Peace''.&lt;ref name="GRI" /&gt;

Ramsey claims that investors can get a 12% [[Annual growth %|average annual return]], which is the rate he uses in financial analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Dave|title=The 12% Reality: Can you really get a 12% return on your mutual fund investments?|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/article/the-12-reality/lifeandmoney_investing/#a8|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Carrns responded that using an average annual return rate is misleading and that the [[compound annual growth rate]] is a better measurement for planning investments.&lt;ref name=carrns&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carrns|first1=Ann|title=Dave Ramsey’s 12% Solution|url=http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/dave-ramseys-12-solution/|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helaine Olen, author of the book "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry" quoted in ''[[Yahoo Finance]]'' stated that a 12% return is unrealistically high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korn|first1=Morgan|title=Don’t Get Your Money Advice from Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey: Pound Foolish Author|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/don-t-money-advice-suze-orman-dave-ramsey-122754956.html|publisher=[[Yahoo Finance]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=October 23, 2014|quote=Equities are extremely volatile and rarely provide the 12% annual return that Orman and Dave Ramsey tout for people looking to quadruple their income, Olen adds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Motley Fool]], following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stoffel|first1=Brian|title=Dangerous Retirement Planning Advice From Financial Guru Dave Ramsey|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/03/dangerous-retirement-planning-advice-from-financia.aspx|publisher=[[The Motley Fool]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|quote=Let's take the case of a 25-year-old who is going to start saving today, and wants to retire when he's 65 with $1 million -- just as Ramsey mentioned on his Twitter page. If that investor assumes he'll make a 12% return per year on his investments, he'll need to save $97 per month. If, however, he assumes his return will be 6.7% -- the S&amp;P 500's CAGR while factoring in inflation, which Ramsey claims to do -- that number jumps to $422 per month. Think about that: $97 per month versus $422.  That's an enormous difference! For the hapless investor who saved $97 per month but experienced a more-normal 6.7% return per year, he will be over $770,000 -- or 77% -- short of his investment goal. I'm not sure why Ramsey harps on this 12% figure while not offering any solid numbers to back it up. His followers would be well served to dial down their assumptions before adjusting their retirement planning process. Dave Ramsey is a fake, and his show is clearly scripted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey recommends investors to hold all their investments in stock mutual funds, but their volatility increases risk compared to bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salmon|first1=Felix|last2=Poppick|first2=Susie|title=Save like Dave Ramsey… Just Don’t Invest Like Him|url=http://time.com/money/2794698/save-like-dave-ramsey-just-dont-invest-like-him/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=October 23, 2014|date=September 26, 2013|quote=More consequentially, Ramsey advocates a portfolio of only stock funds, with no bonds. (He does say that those with low risk tolerance might add a balanced fund, which includes some bonds as well as stocks.) Given the volatility of stocks, that’s aggressive advice, to say the least.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends that retirees withdraw 8% of their retirement fund each year, contrary to the generally recommended 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Dave|title=How to Wreck Your Nest Egg at Retirement: Things you should and shouldn’t do once you retire|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/article/how-to-wreck-your-nest-egg-at-retirement/lifeandmoney_investing/|publisher=Dave Ramsey|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ramsey received criticism on social media sites for building a large and lavish home. He responded that the cost of the home was paid in cash, represented a very low percentage of his net worth, and had already been used to host many fundraisers for ministries, charities and community causes.&lt;ref name="Response to House Criticism"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Leah Marieann Klett|title=Dave Ramsey Offers Powerful, Biblically Sound Response to Criticism over His Multi-Million Dollar Home|url=http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/54676/20150310/dave-ramsey-offers-powerful-biblically-sound-response-to-criticism-over-his-multi-million-dollar-home.htm|website=The Gospel Herald|accessdate=March 5, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306021332/http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/54676/20150310/dave-ramsey-offers-powerful-biblically-sound-response-to-criticism-over-his-multi-million-dollar-home.htm|archivedate=March 6, 2016|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doctor of Commerce''' ('''DCom''')&lt;ref&gt;General information can be accessed via, for example, the [[South African Qualifications Authority|SAQA]] [http://regqs.saqa.org.za/search.php?cat=qual qualifications page] or the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]] [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ qualifications page] searching for "doctor of commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[doctoral degree]] in [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[economics]]-, and [[management]]-related subjects, awarded by universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The degree is offered both as a [[higher doctorate]], and as a [[research doctorate]].

The higher doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the universities of [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/regulations/award/dcom_regs.shtml Canterbury], [http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/dcom.html Otago], [http://clm.ukzn.ac.za/Libraries/Information_for_students/CLM_sflb.sflb.ashx Kwazulu-Natal], [http://courses.handbooks.uwa.edu.au/courses/c4/40910 Western Australia] and [http://www.wits.ac.za/files/gr264_189955001326275256.pdf Witwatersrand]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
is awarded for published work of the candidate, demonstrating original contributions of "special excellence" in some branch of commerce. The candidate will be a graduate of the university in question.

The research doctorate&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }} and  [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26739 UNISA].&lt;/ref&gt; is largely comparable to a [[PhD]] and in fact "Doctor of Commerce" may refer to a commerce-related [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vms/study/postgraduate/phd.aspx Victoria University of Wellington] and [http://www.nmmu.ac.za/default.asp?id=4882&amp;aq=B%2B&amp;fc=1400&amp;bhcp=1 Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, at some universities the degree-title conferred will be a function of the candidate’s background: for example, in [[operations research]], the degree may be a PhD or a DCom, depending on whether the candidate held a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Commerce]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=24967 UNISA], and the [http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html University of Venda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233931/http://www.univen.ac.za/management_sciences/manage_programmes.html |date=June 8, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in some cases, the degree title may also depend on the area of the research: a thesis focused on a more theoretical area (e.g. [[financial economics|"finance"]]) will be awarded a PhD, while one focused on a specific area or function (e.g. [[Managerial finance|financial management]]) will be awarded a DCom.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx University of Johannesburg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106065404/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/departments/fininvestman/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Pages/5PhDinFinance.aspx |date=January 6, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in some cases the distinction will be whether the degree includes coursework or is entirely thesis based.&lt;ref&gt;For example, at the [http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 University of Pretoria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227140522/http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=578&amp;sub=1&amp;parentid=40&amp;subid=575&amp;ipklookid=3 |date=December 27, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research doctorate is usually accessed following a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|related master's degree]], often the [[Master of Commerce]].  Here, there is generally a requirement that the [[master’s degree]] in question must include a research component, either comprising [[coursework]] with research, or being solely [[thesis]]-based.

The program began in January 1987 when the Hillsborough County [[Commissioner]]s approved ordinance with $21 million in acquisition funding over four years. In 1990 voters approved a 20-year bond issuance for additional land purchases.

'''Ethology''' is the [[scientific method |scientific]] and objective study of animal behaviour, usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ethology |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviourism]] is a term that also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a [[laboratory]] context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of behaviorism |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behaviorism |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/behaviourism |title=Behaviourism |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of [[Charles Darwin]] and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including [[Charles Otis Whitman |Charles O. Whitman]], [[Oskar Heinroth]], and [[Wallace Craig]]. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and by Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], joint awardees of the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 |work=Nobelprize.org. |accessdate=9 September 2016 |quote=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 was awarded jointly to Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen 'for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as [[neuroanatomy]], [[ecology]], and [[evolutionary biology]]. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez-Marin|first=Alex|last2=Paton|first2=Joseph J|last3=Kampff|first3=Adam R|last4=Costa|first4=Rui M|last5=Mainen|first5=Zachary F|date=2014-10-28|title=Big behavioral data: psychology, ethology and the foundations of neuroscience|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.3812|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=17|issue=11|pages=1455–1462|doi=10.1038/nn.3812|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and often study one type of behaviour, such as [[Animal aggression |aggression]], in a number of unrelated animals.

Ethology is a rapidly growing field. Since the dawn of the 21st century, many aspects of [[animal communication]], [[emotion in animals |emotions]], [[animal culture |culture]], [[learning]] and [[animal sexuality |sexuality]] that the scientific community long thought it understood have been re-examined, and new conclusions reached. New fields, such as [[neuroethology]], have developed.

Understanding ethology or animal behaviour can be important in [[animal training]]. Considering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables the trainer to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task. It also enables the trainer to encourage the performance of naturally occurring behaviours and also the discontinuance of undesirable behaviours.&lt;ref name="McGreevyBoakes2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGreevy |first1=Paul |author2=Boakes, Robert |title=Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AG_fdrmUKroC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate=9 September 2016 |year=2011 |publisher=Darlington Press |isbn=978-1-921364-15-0 |pages=xi–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''ethology'' derives from the [[Greek language]]: [[wiktionary:ἦθος |ἦθος]], ''[[ethos]]'' meaning "character" and {{lang |grc |[[wiktionary:-λογία |-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia |-logia]]'' meaning "the study of". The term was first popularized by American [[myrmecologist]] (a person who studies ants) [[William Morton Wheeler]] in 1902.&lt;ref name=insectbehavior&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=Janice R. |author2=Matthews, Robert W. |title=Insect Behaviour |page=13 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2388-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg |upright |thumb |[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) explored the expression of emotions in animals.]]

Because ethology is considered a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the [[evolution]] of behaviour and its understanding in terms of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé [[George Romanes]], who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an [[anthropomorphism |anthropomorphic]] method, [[anecdotal cognitivism]], that did not gain scientific support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf |title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons |last=Keeley |first=Brian L.|date=2004 |publisher=York University |pages=527 |accessdate=19 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf | archivedate=17 December 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early ethologists, such as Charles O. Whitman, [[Oskar Heinroth]], Wallace Craig and [[Julian Huxley]], instead concentrated on behaviours that can be called instinctive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their beginning for studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an [[ethogram]] (a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence).This provided an objective, cumulative database of behaviour, which subsequent researchers could check and supplement.&lt;ref name=insectbehavior/&gt;

=== Growth of the field ===
Due to the work of [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Niko Tinbergen]], ethology developed strongly in continental Europe during the years prior to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=insectbehavior /&gt; After the war, Tinbergen moved to the [[University of Oxford]], and ethology became stronger in the [[United Kingdom |UK]], with the additional influence of [[William Homan Thorpe |William Thorpe]], [[Robert Hinde]], and [[Patrick Bateson]] at the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour of the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bateson |first=P. |title=The Development and Integration of Behaviour: Essays in Honour of Robert Hinde |page=479 |isbn=978-0-521-40709-0 |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, too, ethology began to develop strongly in [[North America]].

Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973 for their work of developing ethology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Yearbook of science and the future |year=1975 |page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethology is now a well-recognized scientific discipline, and has a number of journals covering developments in the subject, such as ''[[Animal Behaviour (journal) |Animal Behaviour]]'', ''[[Animal Welfare (journal) |Animal Welfare]]'', ''[[Applied Animal Behaviour Science]]'', ''[[Animal Cognition]]'', ''[[Behaviour (journal) |Behaviour]]'', ''[[Behavioral Ecology (journal) |Behavioral Ecology]]'' and ''[[Journal of Ethology (journal) |Journal of Ethology]]''. In 1972, the [http://ishe.org/ International Society for Human Ethology] was founded to promote exchange of knowledge and opinions concerning human behaviour gained by applying ethological principles and methods and published their journal, ''[http://ishe.org/human-ethology-bulletin/ The Human Ethology Bulletin]''. In 2008, in a paper published in the journal ''Behaviour'', ethologist Peter Verbeek introduced the term "Peace Ethology" as a sub-discipline of Human Ethology that is concerned with issues of human conflict, conflict resolution, reconciliation, war, peacemaking, and peacekeeping behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Verbeek | first1=Peter | year=2008 | title=Peace Ethology | journal=Behaviour | volume=145 | issue=11 | pages=1497–1524 | doi=10.1163/156853908786131270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ethology and recent developments ===
In 1972, the [[England|English]] ethologist John H. Crook distinguished comparative ethology from social ethology, and argued that much of the ethology that had existed so far was really comparative ethology—examining animals as individuals—whereas, in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.&lt;ref name="Crook Goss-Custard 1972 pp. 277–312"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crook | first=John H. | last2=Goss-Custard | first2=J. D. | title=Social Ethology | journal=Annual Review of Psychology | volume=23 | issue=1 | year=1972 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.23.020172.001425 | pages=277–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1970, [[Robert Ardrey]]'s book ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' was published. The book and study investigated animal behaviour and then compared human behaviour to it as a similar phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ardrey |first=Robert |title=The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder |year=1970 |publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' appeared in 1975,&lt;ref name=WilsonSociobiology/&gt; and since that time, the study of behaviour has been much more concerned with social aspects. It has also been driven by the stronger, but more sophisticated, Darwinism associated with Wilson, [[Robert Trivers]], and [[W. D. Hamilton]]. The related development of [[behavioural ecology]] has also helped transform ethology.&lt;ref name="Davies 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Davies | first=N. B. | title=An introduction to behavioural ecology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4051-1416-5 | oclc=785989129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a substantial rapprochement with comparative psychology has occurred, so the modern scientific study of behaviour offers a more or less seamless spectrum of approaches: from [[animal cognition]] to more traditional [[comparative psychology]], ethology, [[sociobiology]], and behavioural ecology.

== Relationship with comparative psychology ==
[[Comparative psychology]] also studies animal behaviour, but, as opposed to ethology, is construed as a sub-topic of [[psychology]] rather than as one of [[biology]]. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about human psychology, ethology involves research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[phylogenetic]] history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.

The two approaches are complementary rather than competitive, but they do result in different perspectives, and occasionally conflicts of opinion about matters of substance. In addition, for most of the twentieth century, comparative psychology developed most strongly in [[North America]], while ethology was stronger in [[Europe]]. From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few [[species]]. Ethologists were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across [[alpha taxonomy |taxonomic]] groups. Ethologists have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.

== Instinct ==
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg |right |thumb |[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate regurgitating reflex]]
The [[Webster's Dictionary |Merriam-Webster dictionary]] defines [[instinct]] as "A largely inheritable and unalterable tendency of an organism to make a complex and specific response to environmental stimuli without involving reason".&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |title=Instinct |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instinct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fixed action patterns ===
{{main|Fixed action pattern}}

An important development, associated with the name of Konrad Lorenz though probably due more to his teacher, [[Oskar Heinroth]], was the identification of [[fixed action pattern]]s. Lorenz popularized these as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of identifiable stimuli called sign stimuli or "[[Releaser|releasing stimuli]]". Fixed action patterns are now considered to be instinctive behavioural sequences that are relatively invariant within the species and that almost inevitably run to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, N. A. |year=1996 |title=Biology |edition=4 |chapter=Chapter 50 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings, New York |isbn=0-8053-1957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a releaser is the [[beak]] movements of many bird species performed by newly hatched chicks, which stimulates the mother to regurgitate food for her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=W. M. |title=A Basic Theory of Neuropsychoanalysis |year=2011 |publisher=Karnac Books |isbn=978-1-85575-809-4 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are the classic studies by Tinbergen on the [[Fixed action pattern egg-retrieval behaviour |egg-retrieval behaviour]] and the effects of a "[[supernormal stimulus]]" on the behaviour of [[Graylag goose|graylag geese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tinbergen, Niko |authorlink=Niko Tinbergen|year=1951 |title=The Study of Instinct |publisher=Oxford University Press, New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tinbergen, Niko |authorlink=Niko Tinbergen |year=1953 |title=The Herring Gull's World |publisher=Collins, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One investigation of this kind was the study of the [[waggle dance]] ("dance language") in [[bee learning and communication |bee communication]] by [[Karl von Frisch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchmann |first=Stephen |title=Letters from the Hive: An Intimate History of Bees, Honey, and Humankind |year=2006 |publisher=Random House of Canada |isbn=978-0-553-38266-2 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==

===Habituation===
{{Main |Habituation}}

Habituation is a simple form of learning and occurs in many animal taxa. It is the process whereby an animal ceases responding to a stimulus. Often, the response is an innate behaviour. Essentially, the animal learns not to respond to irrelevant stimuli. For example, [[prairie dog]]s (''Cynomys ludovicianus'') give alarm calls when predators approach, causing all individuals in the group to quickly scramble down burrows. When prairie dog towns are located near trails used by humans, giving alarm calls every time a person walks by is expensive in terms of time and energy. Habituation to humans is therefore an important adaptation in this context.&lt;ref name="Breed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/habituation.html |title=Habituation |author=Breed, M. D. |year=2001 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The MIT encyclopedia of the cognitive sciences |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-73144-7 |author=Keil, Frank C. |author2=Wilson, Robert Andrew |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bouton |first=M. E. |title=Learning and behavior: A contemporary synthesis |year=2007 |publisher=Sunderland |url=http://sites.sinauer.com/bouton/glossary.html#Habituation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative learning===
{{main|Association (psychology)}}
{{further|Classical conditioning|Operant conditioning}}

Associative learning in animal behaviour is any learning process in which a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/associative-learning |title=Associative learning |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first studies of associative learning were made by Russian [[physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]], who observed that dogs trained to associate food with the ringing of a bell would salivate on hearing the bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudmon |first=Andrew |title=Learning and memory |page=35 |isbn=978-0-7910-8638-4 |year=2005 |publisher=Infobase Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprinting===
{{main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
[[File:Moose-Imprinting-sr81-15.jpg|right|thumb|[[Imprinting (psychology) |Imprinting]] in a [[moose]].]]

[[imprinting (psychology)|Imprinting]] enables the young to discriminate the members of their own species, vital for reproductive success. This important type of learning only takes place in a very limited period of time. Lorenz observed that the young of birds such as [[goose |geese]] and [[chicken]]s followed their mothers spontaneously from almost the first day after they were hatched, and he discovered that this response could be imitated by an arbitrary stimulus if the eggs were incubated artificially and the stimulus were presented during a critical period that continued for a few days after hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mercer |first=Jean |title=Understanding attachment: parenting, child care, and emotional development |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98217-1 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural learning===

====Observational learning====
{{main|Observational learning}}

====Imitation====
{{main|Imitation}}

[[Imitation]] is an advanced behaviour whereby an animal observes and exactly replicates the behaviour of another.
The National Institutes of Health reported that capuchin monkeys preferred the company of researchers who imitated them to that of researchers who did not. The monkeys not only spent more time with their imitators but also preferred to engage in a simple task with them even when provided with the option of performing the same task with a non-imitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2009/nichd-13.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822171642/http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2009/nichd-13.htm |archivedate=2009-08-22 |title=Imitation Promotes Social Bonding in Primates, August 13, 2009 News Release |publisher=National Institutes of Health |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitation has been observed in recent research on chimpanzees; not only did these chimps copy the actions of another individual, when given a choice, the chimps preferred to imitate the actions of the higher-ranking elder chimpanzee as opposed to the lower-ranking young chimpanzee.&lt;ref name="FerrariHorner2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horner |first1=Victoria |author2=et al |title=Prestige Affects Cultural Learning in Chimpanzees |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |date=19 May 2010 |pages=e10625 |issn=1932-6203 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010625 |pmid=20502702 |pmc=2873264 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...510625H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stimulus and local enhancement====

There are various ways animals can learn using observational learning but without the process of imitation. One of these is ''stimulus enhancement'' in which individuals become interested in an object as the result of observing others interacting with the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Spence | first1=K. W. | year=1937 | title=Experimental studies of learning and higher mental processes in infra-human primates | url=| journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=10 | pages=806–850 | doi=10.1037/h0061498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased interest in an object can result in object manipulation which allows for new object-related behaviours by trial-and-error learning. Haggerty (1909) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage, placed its arm into a wooden chute, and pulled a rope in the chute to release food. Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions. The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial-and-error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Haggerty | first1=M. E. | year=1909 | title=Imitation in monkeys | url=| journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=337–455 | doi=10.1002/cne.920190402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example familiar to some cat and dog owners is the ability of their animals to open doors. The action of humans operating the handle to open the door results in the animals becoming interested in the handle and then by trial-and-error, they learn to operate the handle and open the door.

In local enhancement, a demonstrator attracts an observer's attention to a particular location.&lt;ref name="mechanisms"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hoppitt, W. |author2=Laland, K.

Sommerlandt |author2=W. Huber |author3=J. Spaethe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social transmission====
{{see also|Cultural transmission in animals}}

A well-documented example of social transmission of a behaviour occurred in a group of [[macaque]]s on [[Hachijojima]] Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers started giving them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them.&lt;ref name=WilsonSociobiology&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |authorlink=Edward O. Wilson |title=Sociobiology: the new synthesis |page=170 |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-00089-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, putting it into the water with one hand, and cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young - a form of social transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/japanese_macaque.htm |title=Japanese Macaque - Macaca fuscata |publisher=Blueplanetbiomes.org |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
{{see also|Animal culture#Teaching}}

Teaching is a highly specialized aspect of learning in which the "teacher" (demonstrator) adjusts their behaviour to increase the probability of the "pupil" (observer) achieving the desired end-result of the behaviour. For example, [[killer whale]]s are known to intentionally beach themselves to catch [[pinniped]] prey.&lt;ref name=rendell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rendell |first=Luke |last2=Whitehead |first2=Hal |title=Culture in whales and dolphins |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=24 |issue=2 |year=2001 |pages=309–324 |url=http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~barrett/documents/Asoundapproachtothestudyofculture.pdf |doi=10.1017/s0140525x0100396x |pmid=11530544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behaviour to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching.&lt;ref name=rendell/&gt; Teaching is not limited to mammals. Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. [[Ant]]s, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called "[[tandem running]]," in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food.&lt;ref name=hoppit&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hoppitt | first1=W. J. | last2=Brown | first2=G. R. | last3=Kendal | first3=R. | last4=Rendell | first4=L. | last5=Thornton | first5=A. | last6=Webster | first6=M. M. | last7=Laland | first7=K.

The adults (whether individual or in families) teach their young adolescent offspring how to construct and utilize tools. For example, ''[[Pandanus]]'' branches are used to extract insects and other larvae from holes within trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutz|first=Christian|last2=Bluff|first2=Lucas A.|last3=Reed|first3=Nicola|last4=Troscianko|first4=Jolyon|last5=Newton|first5=Jason|last6=Inger|first6=Richard|last7=Kacelnik|first7=Alex|last8=Bearhop|first8=Stuart|date=September 2010|title=The Ecological Significance of Tool Use in New Caledonian Crows|url=|journal=Science|volume=329|pages=1523-1526|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mating and the fight for supremacy==

Individual [[reproduction]] is the most important phase in the proliferation of individuals or genes within a species: for this reason, there exist complex [[mating]] [[ritual]]s, which can be very complex even if they are often regarded as fixed action patterns. The [[stickleback]]'s complex mating ritual, studied by Tinbergen, is regarded as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinbergen |first1=Niko |last2=Van Iersel |first2=J. J. A. |title='Displacement Reactions' in the Three-Spined Stickleback |journal=Behaviour |date=1947 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=56-63 |jstor=4532675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in [[social relation|social life]], animals fight for the right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of fighting for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called [[pecking order]] among [[poultry]]. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rajecki |first=D. W. |date=1988 |title=Formation of leap orders in pairs of male domestic chickens |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=425-436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living in groups==

Several animal species, including humans, tend to live in groups. [[Group size measures |Group size]] is a major aspect of their social environment. [[Social relation |Social life]] is probably a complex and effective survival strategy. It may be regarded as a sort of [[symbiosis]] among individuals of the same species: a [[society]] is composed of a group of individuals belonging to the same species living within well-defined rules on [[food]] management, role assignments and reciprocal dependence.

When [[biologist]]s interested in [[evolution theory]] first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, such as how the birth of [[Reproduce |sterile]] [[caste]]s, like in [[bee]]s, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like [[squirrel]]s, an individual would risk its own life to save the rest of the group. These behaviours may be examples of [[Altruism (biology) |altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cummings, Mark |author2=Zahn-Waxler, Carolyn  |author3=Iannotti, Ronald |title=Altruism and aggression: biological and social origins |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42367-0 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful including chimpanzees,&lt;ref name="McCullough2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=Michael E. |authorlink=Michael McCullough (psychologist) |title=Beyond Revenge: The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daomTGYZuW4C&amp;pg=PA79 |accessdate=27 December 2016 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-26215-3 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anecdotal reports of vengeful camels.&lt;ref name="Waal2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=De Waal |first=Franz |authorlink=Frans de Waal |title=The Ape and the Sushi Master: Cultural Reflections by a Primatologist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFlGdPEBfYC&amp;pg=PA338 |accessdate=27 December 2016 |year=2001 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-04176-3 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits and costs of group living===
One advantage of group living can be decreased predation. If the number of predator attacks stays the same despite increasing prey group size, each prey may have a reduced risk of predator attacks through the dilution effect.&lt;ref name=Davies2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Nicholas B. |authorlink1=Nicholas Barry Davies |author2=Krebs, John R. |authorlink2=John Krebs, Baron Krebs |author3=West, Stuart A. |authorlink3=Stuart West |title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9mXO5asWi8C |edition=4th |year=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-3949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Further, according to the [[selfish herd theory]] theory, the fitness benefits associated with group living vary depending on the location of an individual within the group.

Additionally, a predator that is confused by a mass of individuals can find it more difficult to single out one target.

Another advantage of group living can be an increased ability to forage for food.

Some disadvantages accompany living in groups. Living in close proximity to other animals can facilitate the transmission of parasites and disease, and groups that are too large may also experience greater competition for resources and mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathads |first=Triana |url=http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/a-look-at-animal-social-groups-6-23511/ |title=A Look at Animal Social Groups |website=Science 360 |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030759/http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/a-look-at-animal-social-groups-6-23511/ |archivedate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, social animals should have optimal group sizes that maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of group living. However, in nature, most groups are stable at slightly larger than optimal sizes.&lt;ref name=Davies2012/&gt;{{Page needed |date=December 2016}} Because it generally benefits an individual to join an optimally-sized group, despite slightly decreasing the advantage for all members, groups may continue to increase in size until it is more advantageous to remain alone than to join an overly full group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sibley | first1=R.

==Tinbergen's four questions for ethologists==
{{Main |Tinbergen's four questions}}

Niko Tinbergen argued that ethology always needed to include four kinds of explanation in any instance of behaviour:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinbergen |first1=Niko |authorlink1=Niko Tinbergen |title=On aims and methods in ethology |journal=Zeitschrift fur Tierpsychologie |date=1963 |volume=20 |pages=410–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Function – How does the behaviour affect the animal's chances of survival and reproduction? Why does the animal respond that way instead of some other way?
* Causation – What are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning?
* Development – How does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the animal to display the behaviour?
* Evolutionary history – How does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have begun through the process of [[phylogeny]]?

These explanations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive—all instances of behaviour require an explanation at each of these four levels. For example, the function of eating is to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of eating is hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism's lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions—for example, to argue that people eat because they're hungry and not to acquire nutrients—without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett et al. (2002) Human Evolutionary Psychology. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Far-fetched facts''''' is a book by German [[anthropologist]] [[Richard Rottenburg]] published in German as ''Weit hergeholte Fakten'' in 2002; the English translation was released in 2009. The book is an [[ethnography|ethnography-based]], though fictionalized, [[polyphonic]] account of a waterworks improvement project in Tanzania (called Ruritania in the books fictionalization). The book follows the different stages of the development project by looking closely at the interactions between a Northern development bank, experts of an international consulting firm and African project managers. It focuses thereby on technologies of inscription that enable the reconnaissance and [[operationalization]] of improvement measures to be taken, but also guide the overall interaction between the different stakeholders of the project. Showing these representational and managerial practices the book lays bare the necessary day-to-day production of objectivity and legitimacy in development projects, but also the intricacies and inconsistencies of daily translation processes, that often lead to the rather disappointing results of such development enterprises. Inspired by [[Organizational studies|organizational]] and [[science and technology studies]] “Far-fetched facts” provides an anthropological critique of the aid industry in Africa distinct from [[Postdevelopment theory|postdevelopment critique]].

A '''flue-gas stack''' is a type of [[chimney]], a vertical pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called [[flue gas]]es are exhausted to the outside air. Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is [[combustion|combusted]] in an industrial furnace, a [[power station|power plant's]] steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor as well as [[nitrogen]] and excess [[oxygen]] remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[sulfur oxides]]. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300&amp;nbsp;feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the [[concentration]] of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.

When the flue gases are exhausted from stoves, ovens, fireplaces, or other small sources within residential abodes, restaurants, hotels, or other public buildings and small commercial enterprises, their flue gas stacks are referred to as chimneys.

==History==

The first industrial chimneys were built in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the [[Stack effect#The flow induced by the stack effect|draft]] of air into the combustion zone.&lt;ref&gt;Douet, James (1988). ''Going up in Smoke:The History of the Industrial Chimney'', Victorian Society, London, England.  [http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html Victorian Society Casework Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925221950/http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they played an important part in the development of [[reverberatory furnace]]s and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as '''flue gas stacks''') were built into the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney. The first free-standing industrial chimneys were probably those erected at the end of the long condensing [[flue]]s associated with smelting [[lead]].

The powerful association between industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes of the industrial revolution was due to the universal application of the [[steam engine]] for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a steam-generating boiler, and its evolution is closely linked to increases in the power of the steam engine. The chimneys of [[Thomas Newcomen]]’s steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with [[James Watt]]’s "double-powered" engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys  from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork.

The invention of fan-assisted forced draft in the early 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With the replacement of the steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the  early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental [[air pollution]] control regulations.

==Flue-gas stack draft==
[[Image:Chimney effect.svg|thumb|180px|right|The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure.]]
{{main|Stack effect}}

The combustion flue gases inside the flue gas stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney.  That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called "natural draft", [[HVAC#Natural ventilation|"natural ventilation"]], "chimney effect", or "[[stack effect]]". The taller the stack, the more draft is created.

The equation below provides an approximation of the pressure difference, Δ''P'', (between the bottom and the top of the flue gas stack) that is created by the draft:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512181617/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th Edition (page 9-72)|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =Cah\bigg(\frac {1}{T_o} - \frac {1}{T_i}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Δ''P'': available pressure difference, in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
* ''C'' = 0.0342
* ''a'': atmospheric pressure, in Pa
* ''h'': height of the flue gas stack, in m
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute outside air temperature, in [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute average temperature of the flue gas inside the stack, in K.

The above equation is an approximation because it assumes that the [[molar mass]] of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the pressure drop through the flue gas stack is quite small.  Both assumptions are fairly good but not exactly accurate.

== Flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft==

As a "first guess" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft of a flue-gas stack. The equation assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the [[friction|frictional resistance]] and heat losses are negligible:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702065714/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm |date=2006-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = CA\sqrt {2gH\frac{T_i - T_o}{T_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Q'': flue-gas flow-rate, m³/s  
* ''A'': cross-sectional area of chimney, m² (assuming it has a constant cross-section)  
* ''C'' : discharge coefficient (usually taken to be 0.65–0.70)
* ''g'': [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration at sea level]] = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s² 
* ''H'' : height of chimney, m 
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute average temperature of the flue gas in the stack, [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute outside air temperature, K

Also, this equation is only valid when the resistance to the draft flow is caused by a single orifice characterized by the discharge coefficient C. In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the flue stack itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H. This causes a cancellation of the H in the above equation predicting Q to be invariant with respect to the flue height.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a great many factors such as:

* The height and diameter of the stack.
* The desired amount of excess combustion air needed to assure complete combustion.
* The temperature of the flue gases leaving the combustion zone.
* The composition of the combustion flue gas, which determines the flue-gas density.
* The frictional resistance to the flow of the flue gases through the chimney or stack, which will vary with the materials used to construct the chimney or stack.
* The heat loss from the flue gases as they flow through the chimney or stack.
* The local atmospheric pressure of the ambient air, which is determined by the local elevation above sea level.

The calculation of many of the above design factors requires trial-and-error reiterative methods.

Government agencies in most countries have specific codes which govern how such design calculations must be performed. Many non-governmental organizations also have codes governing the design of chimneys and stacks (notably, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] codes).

==Stack design==
The design of large stacks poses considerable engineering challenges.  [[Vortex shedding]] in high winds can cause dangerous [[oscillations]] in the stack, and may lead to its collapse.  The use of helical faring is common to prevent this process occurring at or close to the [[resonant frequency]] of the stack.

==Other items of interest==

Some fuel-burning industrial equipment does not rely upon natural draft.  Many such equipment items use large fans or blowers to accomplish the same objectives, namely: the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber and the flow of the hot flue gas out of the chimney or stack.

A great many power plants are equipped with facilities for the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] (i.e., [[flue-gas desulfurization]]), [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[selective catalytic reduction]], [[exhaust gas recirculation]], thermal deNOx, or low NOx burners) and particulate matter (i.e., [[electrostatic precipitator]])s. At such power plants, it is possible to use a [[cooling tower]] as a flue gas stack. Examples can be seen in Germany at the [[Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg]] and at the [[Rostock Power Station]]. Power plants without flue gas purification, would experience serious corrosion in such stacks.

In the United States and a number of other countries, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local [[air pollution]] regulations. The United States also limits the maximum height of a flue gas stack to what is known as the "Good Engineering Practice (GEP)" stack height.&lt;ref&gt;''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'' (1985), EPA Publication No. EPA–450/4–80–023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85–225241)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Jr., R.E. and W.H. Snyder (1983). ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', EPA Publication No. EPA–600/3–83–024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83–207407)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modelling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

[[Image:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] of Russia. Reconstruction by [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|M. Gerasimov]], Soviet archaeologist and anthropologist who developed the first technique of forensic sculpture. 1965]]
'''Forensic facial reconstruction''' (or '''forensic facial approximation''') is the process of recreating the face of an individual (whose identity is often not known) from their [[skeletal]] remains through an amalgamation of artistry, [[anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[anatomy]].  It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of [[forensic anthropology]].  Despite this controversy, facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced.

In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations, facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of [[prehistoric]] [[hominids]] and [[human]]s.

== Types of identification==
There are two forms pertaining to [[forensic identification|identification]] in [[forensic anthropology]]: '''circumstantial''' and '''positive'''.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Burns. ''Forensic Anthropology Training Manual.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Circumstantial identification''' is established when an individual fits the biological profile of a set of skeletal or largely skeletal remains.  This type of identification does not prove or verify identity because any number of individuals may fit the same biological description.
*'''Positive identification''', one of the foremost goals of forensic science, is established when a unique set of biological characteristics of an individual are matched with a set of skeletal remains.  This type of identification requires the skeletal remains to correspond with medical or dental records, unique ante mortem wounds or pathologies, [[DNA]] analysis, and still other means.&lt;ref&gt;Reichs and Craig. ''Facial Approximation: Procedures and Pitfalls.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction presents investigators and family members involved in criminal cases concerning unidentified remains with a unique alternative when all other identification techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;  Facial approximations often provide the stimuli that eventually lead to the positive identification of remains.

== Legal admissibility ==
In the U.S., the [[Daubert Standard]] is a legal precedent set in 1993 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods.&lt;ref name=Steadman&gt;Steadman&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple [[forensic]] artists produce approximations for the same set of skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer et al. ''Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the [[Daubert Standard]], is not considered a legally recognized technique for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.

== Types of reconstructions ==

=== Two-dimensional reconstructions ===
[[File:2D facial reconstruction.jpg|thumb|An example of a 2D facial reconstruction conducted by forensic artist Karen T. Taylor, and the subsequent identification, [[Murder of April Lacy|April Dawn Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riggs|first1=Robert|title=Robert Riggs Reports Forensic Artist Reconstructs Victims Faces May 2004|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o70ltA64lI|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Forensic facial reconstruction of Alberto di Trento.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of [[Alberto di Trento]] by Arc-Team and the 3D artist Cicero Moraes]]

Two-dimensional facial reconstructions are based on ante mortem [[photograph]]s, and the [[human skull|skull]].  Occasionally skull radiographs are used but this is not ideal since many cranial structures are not visible or at the correct scale. This method usually requires the collaboration of an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  A commonly used method of 2D facial reconstruction was pioneered by [[Karen T. Taylor]] of Austin, Texas during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." Forensic Files. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's method involves adhering tissue depth markers on an unidentified skull at various anthropological landmarks, then photographing the skull.  Life-size or one-to-one frontal and lateral photographic prints are then used as a foundation for facial drawings done on transparent vellum.  Recently developed, the F.A.C.E. and C.A.R.E.S. computer software programs quickly produce two-dimensional facial approximations that can be edited and manipulated with relative ease.  These programs may help speed the reconstruction process and allow subtle variations to be applied to the drawing, though they may produce more generic images than hand-drawn artwork.&lt;ref name=Reichs&gt;Reichs and Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-dimensional reconstructions ===
Three-dimensional facial reconstructions are either: 1) sculptures (made from casts of [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains) created with modeling clay and other materials or 2) high-resolution, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer images]].  Like two-dimensional reconstructions, three-dimensional reconstructions usually require both an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  Computer programs create three-dimensional reconstructions by manipulating scanned [[photograph]]s of the unidentified cranial remains, [[stock photography|stock photographs]] of facial features, and other available reconstructions. These computer approximations are usually most effective in victim identification because they do not appear too artificial.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; This method has been adapted by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]], which uses this method often to show approximations of an [[unidentified decedent]] to release to the public in hopes to identify the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=9 July 2015| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superimposition ===
[[Superimposition]] is a technique that is sometimes included among the methods of forensic facial reconstruction.  It is not always included as a technique because investigators must already have some kind of knowledge about the identity of the skeletal remains with which they are dealing (as opposed to 2D and 3D reconstructions, when the identity of the skeletal remains are generally completely unknown).  Forensic [[superimposition]]s are created by superimposing a photograph of an individual suspected of belonging to the unidentified skeletal remains over an [[X-ray]] of the unidentified [[human skull|skull]].  If the skull and the photograph are of the same individual, then the anatomical features of the face should align accurately.&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;Lundy. ''Physical Anthropology In Forensic Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hermann Welcker]] in 1883 and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1895, were the first to reproduce three-dimensional facial approximations from [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The Final Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sources, however, acknowledge His as the forerunner in advancing the technique.  His also produced the first data on average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness followed by Kollmann and Buchly who later collected additional data and compiled tables that are still referenced in most laboratories working on facial reproductions today.&lt;ref name=Rhine&gt;Rhine. ''Facial Reproductions In Court.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction originated in two of the four major subfields of [[anthropology]].  In [[biological anthropology]], they were used to approximate the appearance of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] forms, while in [[archaeology]] they were used to validate the remains of historic figures.  In 1964, [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]] was probably the first to attempt paleo-anthropological facial reconstruction to estimate the appearance of ancient peoples&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iscan. ''Craniofacial Image Analysis and Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although students of Gerasimov later used his techniques to aid in criminal investigations, it was [[Wilton M Krogman|Wilton M. Krogman]] who popularized facial reconstruction's application to the [[forensic]] field.  [[Wilton M Krogman|Krogman]] presented his method for facial reconstruction in his 1962 book, detailing his method for approximation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Others who helped popularize three-dimensional facial reconstruction include Cherry (1977), Angel (1977), Gatliff (1984), Snow (1979), and Iscan (1986).&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;

In 2004 it was for Dr. Andrew Nelson of the [[University of Western Ontario]], Department of Anthropology that noted Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] created the first forensic facial reconstruction of an approximately 2,200-year-old mummy based on CT and laser scans. This reconstruction is known as the Sulman Mummy project.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Technique for creating a three-dimensional clay reconstruction ==
[[File:Skulls_for_Facial_Approximation.jpg|thumb|Skulls for Facial Approximation]]

Because a standard method for creating [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] forensic facial reconstructions has not been widely agreed upon, multiple methods and techniques are used.  The process detailed below reflects the method presented by Taylor and Angel from their chapter in Craniofacial Identification in Forensic Medicine, pgs 177-185.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor and Angel. ''Facial Reconstruction and Approximation.''&lt;/ref&gt; This method assumes that the sex, age, and race of the remains to undergo facial reconstruction have already been determined through traditional [[forensic]] [[anthropological]] techniques.

The [[human skull|skull]] is the basis of facial reconstruction; however, other physical remains that are sometimes available often prove to be valuable.  Occasionally, remnants of [[soft tissue]] are found on a set of remains.  Through close inspection, the forensic artist can easily approximate the thickness of the soft tissue over the remaining areas of the skull based on the presence of these tissues.  This eliminates one of the most difficult aspects of reconstruction, the estimation of tissue thickness.  Additionally, any other bodily or physical evidence found in association with remains (e.g. jewelry, hair, glasses, etc.) are vital to the final stages of reconstruction because they directly reflect the appearance of the individual in question.

[[File:Steps of forensic facial reconstruction - Virtual Mummy - cogitas3d.gif|left|thumb|Steps of forensic facial reconstruction of a [[mummy]]]]

Most commonly, however, only the bony skull and minimal or no other soft tissues are present on the remains presented to forensic artists.  In this case, a thorough examination of the skull is completed.  This examination focuses on, but is not limited to, the identification of any bony pathologies or unusual landmarks, ruggedness of [[muscle]] attachments, profile of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], symmetry of the [[nasal bone]]s, [[dentition]], and wear of the occlusal surfaces.  All of these features have an effect on the appearance of an individual's face.

Once the examination is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, according to the alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and [[maxilla]].  Undercuts (like the nasal openings) are filled in with modeling clay and [[prosthetic]] eyes are inserted into the orbits centered between the superior and inferior [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rims.  At this point, a plaster cast of the skull is prepared.  Extensive detail of the preparation of such a cast is presented in the article from which these methods are presented.

After the cast is set, colored plastics or the colored ends of safety matches are attached at twenty-one specific "landmark" areas that correspond to the reference data.  These sites represent the average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness for persons of the same sex, race, and age as that of the remains.  From this point on, all features are added using modeling clay.

First, the [[facial]] [[muscle]]s are layered onto the cast in the following order: temporalis, masseter, buccinator and occipito-frontals, and finally the soft tissues of the neck.  Next, the nose and lips are reconstructed before any of the other muscles are formed.  The lips are approximately as wide as the interpupillary distance.  However, this distance varies significantly with age, sex, race, and occlusion.  The nose is one of the most difficult facial features to reconstruct because the underlying [[bone]] is limited and the possibility of variation is expansive.  The nasal profile is constructed by first measuring the width of the nasal aperture and the nasal spine.  Using a calculation of three times the length of the spine plus the depth of tissue marker number five will yield the approximate nose length.  Next, the pitch of the nose is determined by examining the direction of the nasal spine - down, flat, or up.  A block of clay that is the proper length is then placed on the nasal spine and the remaining nasal tissue is filled in using tissue markers two and three as a guide for the bridge of the nose.  The [[Nasalis muscle|alae]] are created by first marking a point five millimeters below the bottom of the nasal aperture.  After the main part of the nose is constructed, the alae are created as small egg-shaped balls of clay, that are five millimeters in diameter at the widest point, these are positioned on the sides of the nose corresponding with the mark made previously.  The alae are then blended to the nose and the overall structure of the nose is rounded out and shaped appropriately.

The muscles of facial expression and the soft tissue around the eyes are added next.  Additional measurements are made according to race (especially for those with eye folds characteristic of Asian descent) during this stage.  Next, tissues are built up to within one millimeter of the tissue thickness markers and the ears (noted as being extremely complicated to reproduce) are added.  Finally, the face is "fleshed," meaning clay is added until the tissue thickness markers are covered, and any specific characterization is added (for example, hair, wrinkles in the skin, noted racial traits, glasses, etc.). The skull of Mozart was the basis of his facial reconstruction from anthropological data. The bust was unveiled at the "Salon du Son", Paris, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with facial reconstruction ==
There are multiple outstanding problems associated with forensic facial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Lebedinskaya&gt;Lebedinskaya et al. ''Principles of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient tissue thickness data ===
[[File:Gail Mathews.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction and actual photograph of [[Gary Ridgway|Green River victim]] Gail Mathews. The victim had distinctive lips, which could not be represented in the reconstruction, as her body was decomposed.]]
[[File:Durham, Ontario Jane Doe facial reconstructions.jpg|left|thumb|In many cases, the subject's hairstyle is unknown, which causes an artist to guess possible solutions, such as this unidentified woman found in Ontario, Canada.]]

The most pressing issue relates to the data used to average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness.  The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and body builds.  This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions.  Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.&lt;ref name=Rathbun&gt;Rathbun. ''Personal Identification: Facial Reproductions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of methodological standardization ===
A second problem is the lack of a methodological standardization in approximating facial features.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; A single, official method for reconstructing the face has yet to be recognized.  This also presents major setback in facial approximation because facial features like the eyes and nose and individuating characteristics like hairstyle - the features most likely to be recalled by witnesses - lack a standard way of being reconstructed.  Recent research on [[computational forensics|computer-assisted methods]], which take advantage of digital image processing, pattern recognition, promises to overcome current limitations in facial reconstruction and linkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Subjectivity ===
Reconstructions only reveal the type of face a person ''may'' have exhibited because of artistic subjectivity.  The position and general shape of the main facial features are mostly accurate because they are greatly determined by the skull.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;Helmer et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg|thumb|The facial reconstruction of [[Tutankhamun]] as shown on the cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 2005.]]

In recent years, the presence of forensic facial reconstructions in the [[entertainment industry]] and the [[Mass media|media]] has increased.{{Or|date=November 2008}}  The way the fictional criminal investigators and forensic anthropologists utilize forensics and facial reconstructions are, however, often misrepresented{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} (an influence known as the "[[CSI effect]]").{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  For example, the fictional forensic investigators will often call for the creation of a facial reconstruction as soon as a set of skeletal remains is discovered. In many instances, facial reconstructions have been used as a last resort to stimulate the possibility of identifying an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Crime: An Introduction to Forensic Archaeology'' {{ISBN|0-415-16612-8}} p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facial reconstruction has been featured as part of an array of forensic science methods in fictional TV shows like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and their respective spinoffs in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'']] and [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'']] franchises.

In ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', a long-running TV series centered around forensic analysis of decomposed and skeletal human remains, facial reconstruction is featured in the majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to "give victims back their faces" (as noted in the episode, "A Boy in a Bush").

In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Secret Of Parker House", MacGyver reconstructs the skull of Penny's aunt Betty while investigating her house.

The facial reconstruction of Egypt's [[Tutankhamun]], popularly known as King Tut, made the June 2005 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].

A variety of facial reconstruction kits toys are available, with "crime scene" versions, also, reconstructions of famous historical figures, like King Tut and the dinosaur [[T-Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;Several kits from various manufacturers are currently available, others have come and gone over the past decade or so, as evidenced by a Web search for "facial reconstruction kit." Several current models are [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=facial%20reconstruction at amazon.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, facial reconstruction has been part of the process used by researchers attempting to identify human remains of two Canadian Army soldiers lost in [[World War I]]. One soldier was identified through DNA analysis in 2007, but due to DNA deterioration, identifying the second using the same techniques failed. In 2011, the second of the soldiers' remains discovered at [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]], [[France]] were identified through a combination of 3-D printing software, reconstructive sculpture and use of isotopic analysis of bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-06-04/article-2558929/Where-science-meets-art/1|title=Where science meets art|last=Baird|first=Moira|date=June 4, 2011|work=The Telegram|publisher=Transcontinental Media|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quiring03222011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagegamer.net/2011/03/22/3d-printing-technology-helped-identify-canadian-ww1-soldier/|title=3D Printing Technology Helped Identify Canadian WW1 Soldier|last=Quiring|first=Tami|date=March 22, 2011|work=Village Gamer|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Aldergrove, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

In most known cases, gamma rays from [[solar flare]] and [[Terrestrial gamma-ray flash|Earth's atmosphere]])are generated in the MeV range, but it is now known that gamma rays in the GeV range can also be generated by solar flares. Formerly, it was believed that gamma rays in the GeV range do not originate in the [[Solar System]]. As GeV gamma rays are important in the study of extrasolar, and especially extra-galactic astronomy, new findings may complicate some prior models and findings.{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strange-gamma-rays-sun-magnetic-fields | title = Strange gamma rays from the sun may help decipher its magnetic fields}}{{cite web | url = https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasas-fermi-sees-gamma-rays-from-hidden-solar-flares. | title = NASA's Fermi Sees Gamma Rays from 'Hidden' Solar Flares}}
The mechanisms emitting gamma rays are diverse, mostly identical with those emitting X-rays but at higher energies, including [[electron-positron annihilation]], the [[inverse Compton effect]], and in some cases also the [[Radioactive decay|decay of radioactive material]] (gamma decay) in space&lt;ref&gt;for example, supernova [[SN 1987A]] emitted an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive [[cobalt-56]] ejected into space in a cloud, by the explosion. {{cite web | url = http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/gamma.html | title = The Electromagnetic Spectrum - Gamma-rays | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting extreme events such as [[supernova]]e and [[hypernova]]e, and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions, as in [[pulsar]]s and [[blazar]]s. 
The highest photon energies measured to date are in the TeV range, the record being held by the [[Crab Pulsar]] in 2004, yielding photons with as much as 80 TeV.&lt;ref name="CarlinoD'Ambrosio2008"&gt;{{cite book

==Detector technology==
Observation of gamma rays first became possible in the 1960s. Their observation is much more problematic than that of X-rays or of visible light, because gamma-rays are comparatively rare, even a "bright" source needing an observation time of several minutes before it is even detected, and because gamma rays are difficult to focus, resulting in a very low resolution. The most recent generation of gamma-ray telescopes (2000s) have a resolution of the order of 6 arc minutes in the GeV range (seeing the [[Crab Nebula]] as a single "pixel"), compared to 0.5 arc seconds seen in the low energy X-ray (1 keV) range by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] (1999), and about 1.5 arc minutes in the high energy X-ray (100 keV) range seen by [[High-Energy Focusing Telescope]] (2005).

Very energetic gamma rays, with photon energies over ~30 GeV, can also be detected by ground-based experiments. The extremely low photon fluxes at such high energies require detector effective areas that are impractically large for current space-based instruments. Such high-energy photons produce extensive showers of secondary particles in the atmosphere that can be observed on the ground, both directly by radiation counters and optically via the [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] which the ultra-relativistic shower particles emit. The [[IACT|Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope]] technique currently achieves the highest sensitivity.

Gamma radiation in the TeV range emanating from the [[Crab Nebula]] was first detected in 1989 by the [[Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory]] at [[Mount Hopkins (Arizona)|Mt. Hopkins]], in [[Arizona]] in the USA. Modern Cherenkov telescope experiments like [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|H.E.S.S.]], [[VERITAS]], [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]], and CANGAROO III can detect the Crab Nebula in a few minutes. The most energetic photons (up to 16 [[TeV]]) observed from an extragalactic object originate from the [[blazar]], [[Markarian 501]] (Mrk 501). These measurements were done by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy ([[HEGRA]]) air [[Cherenkov effect|Cherenkov]] telescopes.

Gamma-ray astronomy observations are still limited by non-gamma-ray backgrounds at lower energies, and, at higher energy, by the number of photons that can be detected. Larger area detectors and better background suppression are essential for progress in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krieg | first1 = Uwe | title = Reviews in Modern Astronomy, Cosmic Matter | volume = 20 | editors = Siegfried Röser | publisher = WILEY-VCH | page = 191 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=3EOsVn_KbJ8C&amp;pg=PA191| isbn = 978-3-527-40820-7 | date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discovery in 2012 may allow focusing gamma-ray telescopes.&lt;ref name=wogan/&gt; At photon energies greater than 700 keV, the index of refraction starts to increase again.&lt;ref name=wogan&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/may/09/silicon-prism-bends-gamma-rays Tim Wogan - Silicon 'prism' bends gamma rays (May 2012) - PhysicsWorld.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Long before experiments could detect gamma rays emitted by cosmic sources, scientists had known that the universe should be producing them. Work by [[Eugene Feenberg]] and [[Henry Primakoff]] in 1948, [[Sachio Hayakawa]] and I.B. Hutchinson in 1952, and, especially, [[Philip Morrison]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/3064g7043r2t77k5/ | title = On gamma-ray astronomy | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | date = March 16, 1958 | first = Philip | last = Morrison | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 858–865| doi = 10.1007/BF02745590 | accessdate = 2010-11-14|bibcode = 1958NCim....7..858M }}&lt;/ref&gt; had led scientists to believe that a number of different processes which were occurring in the universe would result in gamma-ray emission. These processes included [[cosmic ray]] interactions with [[interstellar gas]], [[supernova]] explosions, and interactions of energetic [[electron]]s with [[magnetic field]]s. 
However, it was not until the 1960s that our ability to actually detect these emissions came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091207123810.htm | title = Cosmic Rays Hunted Down: Physicists Closing in on Origin of Mysterious Particles | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | date = Dec 7, 2009 | publisher = ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most gamma rays coming from space are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so gamma-ray astronomy could not develop until it was possible to get detectors above all or most of the atmosphere using [[balloon]]s and spacecraft. The first gamma-ray telescope carried into orbit, on the [[Explorer 11]] satellite in 1961, picked up fewer than 100 cosmic gamma-ray photons. They appeared to come from all directions in the Universe, implying some sort of uniform "gamma-ray background". Such a background would be expected from the interaction of cosmic rays (very energetic charged particles in space) with interstellar gas.

The first true astrophysical gamma-ray sources were solar flares, which revealed the strong 2.223 MeV line predicted by Morrison. This line results from the formation of deuterium via the union of a neutron and proton; in a solar flare the neutrons appear as secondaries from interactions of high-energy ions accelerated in the flare process. These first gamma-ray line observations were from [[OSO-3]], [[OSO-7]], and the [[Solar Maximum mission|Solar Maximum Mission]], the latter spacecraft launched in 1980. The solar observations inspired theoretical work by [[Reuven Ramaty]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/history_gamma.html | title = The History of Gamma-ray Astronomy | accessdate = 2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant gamma-ray emission from our galaxy was first detected in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ga-He/Gamma-Ray.html | title = Gamma ray | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | work = Science Clarified}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the detector aboard the [[OSO-3]] satellite. It detected 621 events attributable to cosmic gamma rays. However, the field of gamma-ray astronomy took great leaps forward with the [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite|SAS-2]] (1972) and the [[COS-B]] (1975–1982) satellites. These two satellites provided an exciting view into the high-energy universe (sometimes called the 'violent' universe, because the kinds of events in space that produce gamma rays tend to be high-speed collisions and similar processes). They confirmed the earlier findings of the gamma-ray background, produced the first detailed map of the sky at gamma-ray wavelengths, and detected a number of point sources. However the resolution of the instruments was insufficient to identify most of these point sources with specific visible stars or stellar systems.

A discovery in gamma-ray astronomy came in the late 1960s and early 1970s from a constellation of military defense satellites. Detectors on board the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellite series, designed to detect flashes of gamma rays from nuclear bomb blasts, began to record bursts of gamma rays from deep space rather than the vicinity of the Earth. Later detectors determined that these [[gamma ray burst|gamma-ray burst]]s are seen to last for fractions of a second to minutes, appearing suddenly from unexpected directions, flickering, and then fading after briefly dominating the gamma-ray sky. Studied since the mid-1980s with instruments on board a variety of satellites and space probes, including Soviet [[Venera]] spacecraft and the [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]], the sources of these enigmatic high-energy flashes remain a mystery. They appear to come from far away in the Universe, and currently the most likely theory seems to be that at least some of them come from so-called ''[[hypernova]]'' explosions&amp;mdash;supernovas creating [[black hole]]s rather than [[neutron star]]s.

Nuclear [[gamma ray]]s were observed from the [[solar flare]]s of August 4 and 7, 1972, and November 22, 1977.&lt;ref name=Ramaty&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/190596 |author=Ramaty R, Kozlovsky B, Lingenfelter RE |title=Nuclear gamma-rays from energetic particle interactions |journal=Astrophys.

A [[solar flare]] is an explosion in a solar atmosphere and was originally detected visually in our own sun. Solar flares create massive amounts of radiation across the full electromagnetic spectrum from the longest wavelength, [[radio waves]], to high energy gamma rays. The correlations of the high energy electrons energized during the flare and the gamma rays are mostly caused by nuclear combinations of high energy protons and other heavier ions. These gamma rays can be observed and allow scientists to determine the major results of the energy released, which is not provided by the emissions from other wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/flares.htm | title = Overview of Solar Flares | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CGRO s37-96-010.jpg|thumb|Compton released into orbit by the Space Shuttle, 1991]]
On June 19, 1988, from [[Birigüi]] (50° 20' W 21° 20' S) at 10:15 UTC a balloon launch occurred which carried two NaI(Tl) detectors (600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; total area) to an air pressure altitude of 5.5 mb for a total observation time of 6 hr.&lt;ref name=Figueiredo&gt;{{cite journal |author=Figueiredo N, Villela T, Jayanthi UB, Wuensche CA, Neri JACF, Cesta RC |title=Gamma-ray observations of SN1987A |journal=Rev Mex Astron Astrofis. |date=1990 |volume=21 |pages=459–62 |bibcode=1990RMxAA..21..459F |last2=Villela |last3=Jayanthi |last4=Wuensche |last5=Neri |last6=Cesta }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[supernova]] SN1987A in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) was discovered on February 23, 1987, and its progenitor was a [[blue supergiant]], [[Sanduleak -69° 202|(Sk -69 202)]], with luminosity of 2-5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s.&lt;ref name=Figueiredo/&gt; The 847 keV and 1238 keV gamma-ray lines from &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co decay have been detected.&lt;ref name=Figueiredo/&gt;

During its [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatory]] program in 1977, [[NASA]] announced plans to build a "great observatory" for gamma-ray astronomy. The [[Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) was designed to take advantage of the major advances in detector technology during the 1980s, and was launched in 1991. The satellite carried four major instruments which have greatly improved the spatial and temporal resolution of gamma-ray observations. The CGRO provided large amounts of data which are being used to improve our understanding of the high-energy processes in our Universe. CGRO was de-orbited in June 2000 as a result of the failure of one of its stabilizing [[gyroscope]]s.

[[BeppoSAX]] was launched in 1996 and deorbited in 2003. It predominantly studied X-rays, but also observed gamma-ray bursts. By identifying the first non-gamma ray counterparts to gamma-ray bursts, it opened the way for their precise position determination and optical observation of their fading remnants in distant galaxies.

The [[High Energy Transient Explorer]] 2 (HETE-2) was launched in October 2000 (on a nominally 2-year mission) and was still operational (but fading) in March 2007.

==2000s &amp; 2010s==
{{further|Pulsar|Blazar}}
[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]], a NASA spacecraft, was launched in 2004 and carries the BAT instrument for gamma-ray burst observations. Following BeppoSAX and HETE-2, it has observed numerous X-ray and optical counterparts to bursts, leading to distance determinations and detailed optical follow-up. These have established that most bursts originate in the explosions of massive stars ([[supernova]]s and [[hypernova]]s) in distant galaxies. It is still operational in 2015.

Currently the (other) main space-based gamma-ray observatories are the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory ([[INTEGRAL]]), [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]], and the Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini Leggero ([[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]]).
*[[INTEGRAL]] (launched on 17 October 2002) is an ESA mission with additional contributions from the [[Czech Republic]], Poland, US, and Russia.
*[[AGILE (satellite)|AGILE]] is an all Italian small mission by [[Italian Space Agency|ASI]], [[INAF]] and [[INFN]] collaboration. It was successfully launched by the Indian [[PSLV-C8]] rocket from the [[Sriharikota]] [[ISRO]] base on April 23, 2007.
*[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]] was launched by NASA on 11 June 2008. It includes LAT, the Large Area Telescope, and GBM, the GLAST Burst Monitor, for studying gamma-ray bursts.

[[File:800 nasa structure renderin2.jpg|thumb|Concept of two gigantic gamma-ray bubbles at the heart of the Milky Way.]]
In November 2010, using the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], two gigantic gamma-ray bubbles, spanning about 25,000 [[light-year]]s across, were detected at the heart of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]. These bubbles of [[high energy astronomy|high-energy radiation]] are suspected as erupting from a massive [[black hole]] or evidence of a burst of star formations from millions of years ago. They were discovered after scientists filtered out the "fog of background gamma-rays suffusing the sky". This discovery confirmed previous clues that a large unknown "structure" was in the center of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 2011 the Fermi team released its second catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the satellite's Large Area Telescope (LAT), which produced an inventory of 1,873 objects shining with the highest-energy form of light. 57% of the sources are [[Blazar]]s. Over half of the sources are [[Active galactic nucleus|active galaxies]], their central [[black hole]]s created gamma-ray emissions detected by the LAT. One third of the sources have not been detected in other wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA-Fermi's Latest Gamma-ray Census Highlights Cosmic Mysteries|url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gamma-ray-census.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground-based gamma-ray observatories include [[High Altitude Water Cherenkov Experiment|HAWC]], [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]], [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS,]] and [[VERITAS]]. Ground-based observatories probe a higher energy range than space-based observatories, since their effective areas can be many orders of magnitude larger than a satellite.

Interest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. and C. Donald Heth. "Psychology: the Science of Behaviour." 4th Edition. Toronto: Pearson Canada Inc., 2007. 684.&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions differ on the origins of an individual's sexual orientation and sexual behavior. Some argue that sexuality is determined by [[genetics]], while others believe it is molded by the environment, or that both of these factors interact to form the individual's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt; This pertains to the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.  In the former, one assumes that the features of a person innately correspond to their natural inheritance, exemplified by drives and instincts; the latter refers to the assumption that the features of a person continue to change throughout their development and nurturing, exemplified by ego ideals and formative identifications.

A new look at an old debate. access excellence. retrieved 12 November 2011, from www.accessexcellence.org/LC/SER/BE/whata.php&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality is driven by genetics and [[mental activity]].

(The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies – Abstract). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. {{ISBN|978-88-95554-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known schools in psychology took opposing positions in the nature-versus-nurture debate: the [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] school led by [[Sigmund Freud]] and the [[Behaviorist]] school which traces its origins to [[John Locke]].

Freud believed sexual drives are instinctive. He was a firm supporter of the nature argument; he said there are a large number of instincts but they are reduced into two broad groups: [[Eros]] (the life instinct), which comprises the self-preserving and erotic instincts, and [[Thanatos]] (the death instinct), which comprises instincts invoking aggression, self-destruction, and cruelty.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/ |title=Freud, Sigmund [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave sexual drives a centrality in human life, actions, and behaviors that had not been accepted before his proposal. His instinct theory said humans are driven from birth by the desire to acquire and enhance bodily pleasures, thus supporting the nature debate. Freud redefined the term ''sexuality'' to make it cover any form of pleasure that can be derived from the human body.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; He also said pleasure lowers tension while displeasure raises it, influencing the sexual drive in humans. His developmentalist perspective was governed by inner forces, especially biological drives and maturation, and his view that humans are biologically inclined to seek sexual gratification demonstrates the nature side of the debate.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"/&gt;
The nurture debate traces back to [[John Locke]] and his theory of the mind as a "[[tabula rasa]]" or blank slate. Later, [[behaviorists]] would apply this notion in support of the idea that the environment is where one develops one's sexual drives.&lt;ref name="Crain, W. C. 1980"&gt;Crain, W. C. (1980).

===Gender differences===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}

Psychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them, including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, [[social learning theory]], [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]], agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States; other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.&lt;ref name="Oliver &amp; Hyde"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84-169019-3 |pages=29–43 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&amp;pg=PA29 |language=en |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical anatomy and reproduction===
Males and females are anatomically similar; this extends to some degree to the [[development of the reproductive system]]. As adults, they have different reproductive mechanisms that enable them to perform sexual acts and to reproduce. Men and women react to sexual stimuli in a similar fashion with minor differences. Women have a monthly reproductive cycle, whereas the male sperm production cycle is more continuous.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Brain====
The [[hypothalamus]] is the most important part of the brain for sexual functioning. This is a small area at the base of the brain consisting of several groups of nerve cell bodies that receives input from the limbic system. Studies have shown that within lab animals, destruction of certain areas of the hypothalamus causes the elimination of sexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The hypothalamus is important because of its relationship to the [[pituitary gland]], which lies beneath it. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that are produced in the hypothalamus and itself. The four important sexual hormones are [[oxytocin]], [[prolactin]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], and [[luteinizing hormone]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the "love hormone,"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} is released in both sexes during sexual intercourse when an [[orgasm]] is achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Oxytocin has been suggested as critical to the thoughts and behaviors required to maintain close relationships.&lt;ref name="Sigelman452"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sigelman |first1=Carol |last2= Rider |first2=Elizabeth | year = 2011 | title =Life-Span Human Development| location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 452 |isbn = 1111342733| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8smBuRecmDsC&amp;pg=PT480 | access-date = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornstein"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hornstein |first1=Theresa |last2=Schwerin |first2=Jeri | year = 2012 | title = Biology of Women | location = Boston, MA, USA | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 205 | isbn = 1285401026| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ibgKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 | accessdate = 7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=February 2016}} The hormone is also released in women when they give birth or are breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book | author = Smith, Linda J. | year = 2010 | title = Impact of Birthing Practices on Breastfeeding | location = Burlington, MA, USA | publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett]] | page = 158 | isbn = 0763763748 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=vUncnT6o4k4C&amp;pg=PA158 | access-date = 20 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both prolactin&lt;!--RIGHT?--&gt; and oxytocin stimulate milk production in women.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is responsible for ovulation in women, which acts by triggering egg maturity; in men it stimulates sperm production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Hyde|first1=Janet|authorlink1=Janet Shibley Hyde|last2=DeLamater|first2=John|authorlink2=John DeLamater| last3=Byers|first3=Sandra | year = 2013 | title=Understanding Human Sexuality | edition = 5th Canadian | location = Whitby, ON, CAN | publisher = McGraw-Hill Ryerson | isbn=9780070329720 | pages=100, 102ff | url =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

====Male anatomy and reproductive system====
{{main|Human male reproductive system}}

Males also have both internal and external genitalia that are responsible for procreation and sexual intercourse. Production of spermatozoa (sperm) is also cyclic, but unlike the female ovulation cycle, the sperm production cycle is constantly producing millions of sperm daily.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

That is what student readers need.) To remove preemptively is disrespectful, and begs the outcome of the discussion.--&gt;

The male genitalia are the penis and the scrotum. The penis provides a passageway for sperm and urine. An average-sized flaccid penis is about {{convert|3+3/4|inch|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/5|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. When erect, the average penis is between {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} to {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=out}} in length and {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|abbr=out}} in diameter. The penis's internal structures consist of the [[shaft (penis)|shaft]], [[glans]], and the [[root]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The shaft of the penis consists of three cylindrical bodies of spongy tissue filled with blood vessels along its length. Two of these bodies lie side-by-side in the upper portion of the penis called corpora cavernosa. The third, called the [[corpus spongiosum]], is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form the tip of the penis (glans).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repmov.html |title=Male Reproductive System - Explore Anatomy with Detailed Pictures |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised rim at the border of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, providing an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]] and the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]], which aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a [[foreskin]] that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by [[circumcision]] for medical, religious or cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drew|first1=Liam|title=The Scrotum Is Nuts|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/are_testicles_external_for_cooling_galloping_display_or_something_else.1.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']]|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madaras|first1=Lynda Madaras with Area|title=The what's happening to my body? book for boys|date=2008|publisher=Newmarket|location=New York|isbn=9781557047656|edition=Rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC1g5gdJc_kC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male internal reproductive structures are the testicles, the duct system, the prostate and seminal vesicles, and the [[bulbourethral gland|Cowper's gland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The testicles are the male gonads where sperm and male hormones are produced. Millions of sperm are produced daily in several hundred seminiferous tubules. Cells called the [[Leydig cell]]s lie between the tubules; these produce hormones called androgens; these consist of [[testosterone]] and [[inhibin]]. The testicles are held by the spermatic cord, which is a tubelike structure containing blood vessels, nerves, the vas deferens, and a muscle that helps to raise and lower the testicles in response to temperature changes and sexual arousal, in which the testicles are drawn closer to the body.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Sperm are transported through a four-part duct system. The first part of this system is the [[epididymis]]. The testicles converge to form the [[seminiferous tubules]], coiled tubes at the top and back of each testicle. The second part of the duct system is the [[vas deferens]], a muscular tube that begins at the lower end of the epididymis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The vas deferens passes upward along the side of the testicles to become part of the spermatic cord.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The expanded end is the ampulla, which stores sperm before ejaculation. The third part of the duct system is the ejaculatory ducts, which are {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=out|adj=on}}-long paired tubes that pass through the prostate gland, where semen is produced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland is a solid, chestnut-shaped organ that surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine and semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to the female G-spot, the prostate provides sexual stimulation and can lead to [[orgasm]] through [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = March 31, 2016| isbn = 0618755713|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prostate gland and the seminal vesicles produce seminal fluid that is mixed with sperm to create semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The prostate gland lies under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It consists of two main zones: the inner zone that produces secretions to keep the lining of the male urethra moist and the outer zone that produces seminal fluids to facilitate the passage of semen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The seminal vesicles secrete fructose for sperm activation and mobilization, prostaglandins to cause uterine contractions that aid movement through the uterus, and bases that help neutralize the acidity of the vagina. The Cowper's glands, or bulbourethral glands, are two pea sized structures beneath the prostate.

====Female anatomy and reproductive system====
{{Main|Human female reproductive system}}

=====External female anatomy=====
[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|upright|External female genitals (depilated).]]

The mons veneris, also known as the [[Mons pubis|Mound of Venus]], is a soft layer of fatty tissue overlaying the pubic bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hyde |last2=DeLamater |last3=Byers|title=Understanding Human Sexuality 5th Canadian ed.|isbn=9780070329720|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following puberty, this area grows in size. It has many nerve endings and is sensitive to stimulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The labia minora and labia majora are collectively known as the lips. The labia majora are two elongated folds of skin extending from the mons to the perineum. Its outer surface becomes covered with hair after puberty. In between the labia majora are the labia minora, two hairless folds of skin that meet above the clitoris to form the clitoral hood, which is highly sensitive to touch. The labia minora become engorged with blood during sexual stimulation, causing them to swell and turn red.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The labia minora are composed of connective tissues that are richly supplied with blood vessels which cause the pinkish appearance. Near the anus, the labia minora merge with the labia majora.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repfov.html |title=Female Reproductive System - Anatomy Pictures and Information |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sexually unstimulated state, the labia minora protects the vaginal and urethral opening by covering them.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Reproductive Biology'' by Mark M. Jones (2012), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the base of the labia minora are the [[Bartholin's glands]], which add a few drops of an alkaline fluid to the vagina via ducts; this fluid helps to counteract the acidity of the outer vagina since sperm cannot live in an acidic environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The clitoris is developed from the same embryonic tissue as the penis; it or its [[Clitoral glans|glans]] alone consists of as many (or more in some cases) nerve endings as the human penis or glans penis, making it extremely sensitive to touch.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"&gt;{{cite book |last=Francoeur |first=Robert T. |year=2000 |title=The Complete Dictionary of Sexology |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |page=180 |isbn=0-8264-0672-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book | title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2009 | page = 118 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=5f8mQx7ULs4C |}} |isbn =978-0-495-60274-3 | first = Janell L. | last = Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Can't feel"&gt;{{cite web | title = I'm a woman who cannot feel pleasurable sensations during intercourse | publisher = [[Go Ask Alice!]] | date = 8 October 2004| accessdate = 13 September 2012|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/im-woman-who-cannot-feel-pleasurable-sensations-during-intercourse |archivedate= 7 January 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107184029/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3229.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clitoral glans, which is a small, elongated erectile structure, has only one known function—sexual sensations.

The vaginal opening and the urethral opening are only visible when the labia minora are parted. These opening have many nerve endings that make them sensitive to touch. They are surrounded by a ring of sphincter muscles called the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]]. Underneath this muscle and on opposite sides of the vaginal opening are the vestibular bulbs, which help the vagina grip the penis by swelling with blood during arousal. Within the vaginal opening is the [[hymen]], a thin membrane that partially covers the opening in many [[Virginity|virgins]]. Rupture of the hymen has been historically considered the loss of  one's virginity, though by modern standards, loss of virginity is considered to be the first sexual intercourse. The hymen can be ruptured by activities other than sexual intercourse. The urethral opening connects to the bladder with the urethra; it expels urine from the bladder. This is located below the clitoris and above the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[breast]]s are external organs used for sexual pleasure in some cultures. Western culture is one of the few in which they are considered erotic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The breasts are the subcutaneous tissues on the front thorax of the female body.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Breasts are modified sweat glands made up of fibrous tissues and fat that provide support and contain nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Their purpose is to provide milk to a developing infant. Breasts develop during puberty in response to an increase in estrogen. Each adult breast consists of 15 to 20 milk-producing [[mammary glands]], irregularly shaped lobes that include [[alveolar gland]]s and a lactiferous duct leading to the nipple. The lobes are separated by dense connective tissues that support the glands and attach them to the tissues on the underlying pectoral muscles.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Other connective tissue, which forms dense strands called suspensory ligaments, extends inward from the skin of the breast to the pectoral tissue to support the weight of the breast.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; Heredity and the quantity of fatty tissue determine the size of the breasts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

=====Internal female anatomy=====
{{main|Female reproductive system}}
[[File:Female reproductive system lateral.png|thumb|The female reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/faqs/altsex/vulva.html |title=The Sexual Anatomy Of Women: Vulva and Vagina |publisher=Luckymojo.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The female internal reproductive organs are the [[vagina]], [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tube]]s, and [[ovary|ovaries]]. The vagina is a sheath-like canal that extends from the vulva to the cervix. It receives the penis during intercourse and serves as a depository for sperm. The vagina is also the [[birth canal]]; it can expand to {{convert|10|cm|inch|abbr=on}} during labor and delivery. The vagina is located between the [[bladder]] and the [[rectum]]. The vagina is normally collapsed, but during [[sexual arousal]] it opens, lengthens, and produces lubrication to allow the insertion of the penis. The vagina has three layered walls; it is a self-cleaning organ with natural  bacteria that suppress the production of yeast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The [[G-spot]], named after the [[Ernst Gräfenberg]] who first reported it in 1950, may be located in the front wall of the vagina and may cause orgasms. This area may vary in size and location between women; in some it may be absent. Various researchers dispute its structure or existence, or regard it as an extension of the clitoris.&lt;ref name=Hines&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hines T |date=August 2001 |title=The G-Spot: A modern gynecologic myth |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=185 |issue=2 |pages=359–62 | doi=10.1067/mob.2001.115995  |pmid=11518892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard |last1=Balon |first2=Robert Taylor |last2=Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders |publisher= [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]]|year=2009|accessdate=24 January 2014|page=258|isbn=1585629057|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC |}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is the Female G-Spot Truly a Distinct Anatomic Entity?|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 9|date=January 2012 |pmid=22240236|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02623.x|laysummary=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/g-spot-does-not-exist_n_1215822.html|laysource=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|laydate=19 January 2012 |last1=Kilchevsky |first1=A |last2=Vardi |first2=Y |last3=Lowenstein |first3=L |last4=Gruenwald |first4=I |issue=3|pages=719–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uterus or womb is a hollow, muscular organ where a fertilized egg (ovum) will implant itself and grow into a fetus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The uterus lies in the pelvic cavity between the bladder and the [[bowel]], and above the vagina. It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt; The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

The ovaries are the female gonads; they develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only  400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.&lt;ref name="innerbody.com"/&gt;

Ovulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation. On day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28—the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle—now called the [[corpus luteum]]—secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Sexual response cycle===

The sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refactory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina.  The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health "Sexual Response" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koedt70"&gt;{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |accessdate = 2010-11-18 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archivedate = 19 August 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of the neurobiological factors of human sexuality===
From [[rodent]] to human, the corticalization of the brain induces several changes in the control of sexual behavior, including lordosis behavior. These changes induce a "difference between the stereotyped sexual behaviors in non-human mammals and the astounding variety of human sexual behaviors".&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;
[[File:Evolution of the biological factors of sexual behavior.png|thumb|600px|left|Evolution of the main neurobiological factors that control the sexual behavior of mammals.&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nei2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;]] {{clr}}

Sexual reflexes, such as the motor reflex of lordosis, become secondary. In particular, lordosis behavior, which is a motor reflex complex and essential to carry out [[copulation]] in non-primate mammals ([[rodent]]s, [[Canidae|canines]], [[bovid]]s ...), is apparently no longer functional in women. Sexual stimuli on women do not trigger any more neither immobilization nor the reflex position of lordosis. On the level of olfactory systems, the [[vomeronasal organ]] is altered in [[hominid]]s&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;Zhang J., Webb D. M. (2003) Evolutionary deterioration of the vomeronasal [[pheromone]] transduction pathway in catarrhine primates, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 100(14):8337-8341.&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of the pheromone [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[gene]]s become [[pseudogene]]s in humans.&lt;ref name="nei2008"&gt;Nei M., Niimura Y., Nozawa M. (2008) The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity. ''Nat. Rev. Genet.'', 9(12):951-963.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning hormonal control, sexual activities are gradually dissociated from hormonal cycles. Humans can have sex anytime during the year and [[Menstrual cycle|hormonal cycles]]. On the contrary, the importance of [[Reward system|rewards / reinforcements]] and [[cognition]] became major. Especially in humans, the extensive development of the [[neocortex]] allows the emergence of [[culture]], which has a major influence on behavior.&lt;ref name="gagnon2005"&gt;Gagnon J.

[[File:Learning of the sexual motivation in humans.png|thumb|600px|left|Multifactorial dynamics of human sexuality&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;]] {{clr}}
In human beings, sexuality is multifactorial, with several factors that interact (genes, hormones, conditioning, sexual preferences, emotions, cognitive processes, cultural context). The relative importance of each of these factors is dependent both on individual physiological characteristics, personal experience and aspects of the sociocultural environment.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;

===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===
{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress, and interpersonal difficulty. The sexual dysfunctions is a result of physical or psychological disorders. The physical causes include, hormonal imbalance, diabetes, heart disease and more. The psychological causes includes but are not limited to, stress, anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women|website=www.webmd.com|publisher=webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual dysfunction affects men and women. There are four major categories of sexual problems for women: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The sexual desire disorder occurs when an individual lacks the sexual desire because of hormonal changes, depression, and pregnancy.The arousal disorder is a female sexual dysfunction. Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted disease and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=www.webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also three common sexual disorders for men including, sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.  The lack of sexual desire in men is because of loss of libido, low testosterone. There are also psychological factors such as anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Sexual Problems|url=http://www.webmd.com/men/guide/mental-health-male-sexual-problems?page=2|website=Webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ejaculation disorder has three types, Retrograde ejaculation, retarded ejaculation, premature ejaculation. The erectile dysfunction is a disability to have and maintain an erection during intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Bodies, Ourselves|date=2011|publisher=BOSTON WOMEN'S HEALTH BOOK COLLECTIVE|isbn=978-0-7432-5611-7|edition=35th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender identity]] is a person's sense of self-identification as female, male, both, neither, or somewhere in between. The social construction of gender has been discussed by many scholars, including [[Judith Butler]]. More recent research has focused upon the influence of feminist theory and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 2002 | title = Human mating strategies | url = | journal = Samdunfsokonemen | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 48–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W.

Sexual behavior and intimate relationships are strongly influenced by a person's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"&gt;Coon, D., &amp; Mitterer, J. O. (2007). Introduction to psychology: gateways to mind and behavior (11th ed.). Australia: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex, same sex, or both sexes.&lt;ref name="Coon, D. 2007"/&gt; Heterosexual people are romantically/sexually attracted to the members of the opposite sex, gay and lesbian people are romantically/sexually attracted to people of the same sex, and those who are bisexual are romantically/sexually attracted to both sexes.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt;

Before the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions. By the end of the 19th century, it was viewed as a pathology.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; [[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt; Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"&gt;{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | pages =  | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA | publisher = Pearson Education | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex. He said male homosexuality resulted when a young boy had an authoritarian, rejecting mother and turned to his father for love and affection, and later to men in general. He said female homosexuality developed when a girl loved her mother and identified with her father, and became fixated at that stage.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Freud and Ellis said homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles. In the early 21st century, this view is reinforced by the media's portrayal of male homosexuals as effeminate and female homosexuals as masculine.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} A person's conformity or non-conformity to gender stereotypes does not always predict sexual orientation. Society believes that if a man is masculine he is heterosexual, and if a man is feminine he is homosexual. There is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. By the early 21st century, homosexuality was no longer considered to be a pathology. Theories have linked many factors, including genetic, anatomical, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment, to homosexuality.&lt;ref name="King, B. 2009"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Other than the need to procreate, there are many other reasons people have sex. According to one study conducted on college students (Meston &amp; Buss, 2007), the four main reasons for sexual activities are; physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=336|author1=Daniel L.

==Sexuality and age==

===Child sexuality===
{{Main|Child sexuality}}
In the past{{when|date=June 2015}}, children were often assumed not to have sexuality until later development. Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of [[infantile sexuality]], and says sexual energy ([[libido]]) is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and [[attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bretherton | first1 = Inge | year = 1992 | title = The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth | url = http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1LQX400NM-RBVKH9-1KL6/the%20origins%20of%20attachment%20theory%20john%20bowlby%20and%20mary%20ainsworth.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| page = 759 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses. During adolescence, a young person tries to integrate these two emotional currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcorn|first1=Jean-Michel Quinodoz; translated by David|title=Reading Freud: a chronological exploration of Freud's writings|date=2005|isbn=9781317710509|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8hdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey]] also examined child sexuality in his [[Kinsey Reports]]. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]], which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as [[playing doctor]], includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt; Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence.&lt;ref name="Santrock, J.W. 2008"/&gt;

===Sexuality in late adulthood===
{{Main|Sexuality in older age}}
Adult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love.&lt;ref name=jrank&gt;[http://family.jrank.org/pages/1532/Sexuality-in-Adulthood-Aging.html Sexuality in Adulthood - Aging], JRank Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, Net Industries&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexuality can be understood as part of the social life of humans, which is governed by implied rules of behavior and the status quo. This narrows the view to groups within a society.&lt;ref name="Rathus, Spencer A. 2007"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The socio-cultural context of society, including the effects of politics and the mass media, influences and forms social norms. Before the early 21st century, people fought for their civil rights. The civil rights movements helped to bring about massive changes in social norms; examples include the sexual revolution and the rise of feminism.&lt;ref name=Escoffier2003&gt;{{cite book|editor=Escoffier, Jeffrey |title=Sexual Revolution |publisher=Running Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-56025-525-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedan&gt;{{cite news|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85 |url=http://www-nc.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between constructed sexual meanings and racial ideologies has been studied. Sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries by denigration of "others" and regulation of sexual behavior within the group. According to Joane Nagel, "both adherence to and deviation from such approved behaviors, define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and nationalist regimes".&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nagel, Joane |date=August 2000 |title=Ethnicity and Sexuality |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=26 |pp=107–133 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagel2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nagel, Joane |year=2001 |title=Racial, Ethnic, and National Boundaries: Sexual Intersections and Symbolic Interactions |journal=Symbolic Interaction |volume=24 | issue = 2  |pp=123–139 |doi=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also study the ways in which [[colonialism]] has effected sexuality today and argue that due to [[racism]] and [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] it has been dramatically changed from the way it had previously been understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rojas|first1=Maythee|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KBFhDytERkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes to sexuality are argued to be largely effected by the enforcement of the [[gender binary]] and [[heteropatriarchy]] as tools of colonization on colonized communities as seen in nations such as [[Hijra (South Asia)|India]], [[fa'afafine|Samoa]], and the [[First Nations]] in the Americas, resulting in the deaths and erasure of non-western genders and sexualities. In the United States people of color face the effects of colonialism in different ways with stereotypes such as the Mammy, and Jezabel for Black women; [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|lotus blossom, and dragon lady]] for Asian women; and the "spicy" Latina.&lt;ref name="Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs on Racism.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yarbrough|first1=Marilyn|last2=Bennet|first2=Crystal|title=Mammy Jezebel and Sistahs|url=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215|website=Race, Racism and the Law!|publisher=racism.org|accessdate=2015-11-30|ref=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1277:aawomen01a&amp;catid=72&amp;Itemid=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of sex education. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries, such as Australia and much of Europe, age-appropriate sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Think Sex |publisher=TheAge.com.au |accessdate=11 October 2009|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/think-sex/2006/05/28/1148754861223.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior. Geographic location also plays a role in society's opinion of the appropriate age for children to learn about sexuality. According to ''TIME'' magazine and CNN,{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} 74% of teenagers in the United States reported that their major sources of sexual information were their peers and the media, compared to 10% who named their parents or a sex education course.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Religious sexual morality===
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}
In some religions, sexual behavior is regarded as primarily spiritual. In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Sexuality|url=http://www.iwgonline.org/sexuality/|publisher=Interfaith Working Group|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious conservatives, especially those of [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Christianity]] in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior (''i.e.'' homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does) and certain sexualities such as [[bisexuality]] tend to be ignored as a result of this.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These conservatives tend to promote [[celibacy]] for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through [[conversion therapy]]&lt;ref name=Tolerance111&gt;{{cite web | title= Two Definitions and Six Interpretations | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom6beli.htm | website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[prayer]] to become an [[ex-gay]]. They may also see homosexuality as a form of mental illness, something that ought to be criminalised, an immoral abomination, caused by ineffective parenting, and view [[same-sex marriage]] as a threat to society.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222&gt;{{cite web|title=Subdividing Two Extreme Belief Systems About Homosexuality Into Six Discrete Viewpoints | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom7beli.htm|website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, most religious liberals define sexuality-related labels in terms of [[sexual attraction]] and self-identification.&lt;ref name=Tolerance111 /&gt; They may also view same-sex activity as morally neutral and as legally acceptable as opposite-sex activity, unrelated to mental illness, genetically or environmentally caused (but not as the result of bad parenting), and fixed. They also tend to be more in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Tolerance222 /&gt;

====Attitude by religion====
According to [[Judaism]], sex between man and woman within marriage is sacred and should be enjoyed; celibacy is considered sinful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that sexuality is "noble and worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 49: AAS 58 (1966), 1070&lt;/ref&gt; but that it must be used in accordance with natural law. For this reason, all sexual activity must occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and must not be divorced from the possibility of conception. Most forms of sex without the possibility of conception are considered intrinsically disordered and sinful, such as the use of contraceptives, [[masturbation]], and homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sixth Commandment|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|website=vatican.va|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], sexual desire is considered to be a natural urge that should not be suppressed, although the concept of free sex is not accepted; these urges should be fulfilled responsibly. Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the [[Quran]] is ''nikah'', which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]], it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Major Patterns of Change and Continuity: World History in Brief | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married. However, homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam, and some Muslim lawyers have suggested that gay people should be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/isloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some have argued that Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled "Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom", by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, 2 May 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts"&gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html 100 Interesting Facts About Islam]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery. For many Muslims, [[sex with reference to the Quran]] indicates that – bar anal intercourse and adultery – a Muslim marital home bonded by ''[[Nikah]]'' marital contract between husband and his wife(s) should enjoy and even indulge, within the privacy of their marital home, in limitless scope of [[heterosexual]] sexual acts within a [[monogamous]] or [[polygamous]] marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lifeinsideislam.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/sex-in-reference-to-the-quran/ Sex in reference to Quran] by A Taha, Accessed on 22 October 2015{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] emphasizes that sex is only appropriate between husband and wife, in which satisfying sexual urges through sexual pleasure is an important duty of marriage. Any sex before marriage is considered to interfere with intellectual development, especially between birth and the age of 25, which is said to be brahmacharya and this should be avoided. [[Kama]] (sensual pleasures) is one of the four purusharthas or aims of life (dharma, artha, kama, and moksha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/hiloveandsexrev1.shtml |title=GCSE Bitesize: Hindu views |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' deals partially with sexual intercourse; it is not exclusively a sexual or religious work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indrasinha.com/kama-sutra/ Common misconceptions about ''Kama Sutra''.] "The ''Kama Sutra'' is neither exclusively a sex manual nor, as also commonly used art, a sacred or religious work. It is certainly not a [[Tantra|tantric]] text. In opening with a discussion of the three aims of ancient Hindu life&amp;nbsp;– [[dharma]], [[artha]] and [[kama]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Vātsyāyana|Vatsyayana's]] purpose is to set kama, or enjoyment of the senses, in context. Thus dharma or virtuous living is the highest aim, artha, the amassing of wealth is next, and kama is the least of three." —[[Indra Sinha]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Carroll| first = Janell| title = Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2009| page = 7| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA7| isbn = 978-0-495-60274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Devi| first = Chandi| title = From Om to Orgasm: The Tantra Primer for Living in Bliss| publisher = [[AuthorHouse]]| year = 2008| page = 288| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gIqhh84DGToC&amp;pg=PA288| isbn = 978-1-4343-4960-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sikhism]] views [[chastity]] as important, as Sikhs believe that the divine spark of ''[[Waheguru]]'' is present inside every individual's body, therefore it is important for one to keep clean and pure. Sexual activity is limited to married couples, and extramarital sex is forbidden. Marriage is seen as a commitment to ''Waheguru'' and should be viewed as part of spiritual companionship, rather than just sexual intercourse, and [[monogamy]] is deeply emphasised in Sikhism. Any other way of living is discouraged, including celibacy and homosexuality. However, in comparison to other religions, the issue of sexuality in Sikhism is not considered one of paramount importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikhism: beliefs about love and sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/sikhloveandsexrev1.shtml|publisher=GCSE BBC Bitesize|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexuality has been an important, vital part of human existence throughout history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | year =  | title = Sexuality in World History | edition =  | pages =  | location =  | publisher =  | isbn = 9780415777773 | url =  | quote = }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} All civilizations have managed sexuality through sexual standards, representations, and behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Before the rise of agriculture, groups of hunter/gatherers (H/G) and nomads inhabited the world. Within these groups, some implications of male dominance existed, but there were signs that women were active participants in sexuality, with bargaining power of their own. These hunter/gatherers had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. H/G groups also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. Two common tensions in H/G societies are expressed in their art, which emphasizes male sexuality and prowess, with equally common tendencies to blur gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] myth, the Gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

Once agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for [[bestiality]]  arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

During the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, many changes in sexual standards occurred. New, dramatic, artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Alfred Kinsey]] initiated the modern era of sex research. He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at [[Indiana University]], but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled 5,300 men and 5,940 women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in [[oral sex]], that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes. Many{{who|date=June 2015}} believe he was the major influence in changing 20th century attitudes about sex. [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]] at Indiana University continues to be a major center for the study of human sexuality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Before [[William Masters]], a physician, and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]], a [[behavioral scientist]], the study of anatomy and physiological studies of sex was still limited to experiments with laboratory animals. Masters and Johnson started to directly observe and record the physical responses in humans that are engaged in sexual activity under laboratory settings. They observed 10,000 episodes of sexual acts between 312 men and 382 women. This led to methods of treating clinical problems and abnormalities. Masters and Johnson opened the first sex therapy clinic in 1965. In 1970, they described their therapeutic techniques in their book, ''[[Human Sexual Inadequacy]]''.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Reproductive and sexual rights===
{{Further|Reproductive health|Reproductive rights}}
Reproductive and sexual rights encompass the concept of applying [[human rights]] to issues related to reproduction and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is a modern one, and remains controversial, especially outside the West, since it deals, directly and indirectly, with issues such as [[contraception]], [[LGBT rights]], [[abortion]], [[sex education]], freedom to choose a partner, freedom to decide whether to be sexually active or not, right to bodily integrity, freedom to decide whether or not, and when, to have children.&lt;ref&gt;

People both consciously and subconsciously seek to attract others with whom they can form deep relationships. This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include:
* [[Flirting]], the attraction of the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations. It can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting. What Social Science can tell you about flirting and how to do it.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting is a socially accepted way of attracting someone. There are different types of flirting, and most people usually have one way of flirting that makes them most comfortable. When flirting, people can be polite, playful, physical, etc. Sometimes it is difficult to know whether or not the person is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.ku.edu/2013/09/11/new-book-outlines-five-types-flirting-styles |title= New book outlines five types of flirting styles |last=Schmidt |first=Megan | publisher=KU News Service |date=9 November 2013 |website=University of Kansas |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flirting styles vary according to culture. Different cultures have different social etiquette. For example, length of eye contact, or how closely one stands by someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419712,00.html |title=Scoring a German: Flirting with Fräuleins, Hunting for Herren - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seduction]], the process whereby one person deliberately entices another to engage in sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Greene, Robert | authorlink=Robert Greene (author) | title=The Art of Seduction | publisher=[[Penguin Books]]| year=2003 | isbn=0-14-200119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is one that the person you are seducing would not usually do, unless sexually aroused. Seduction can be seen as both a positive and a negative. Since the word seduction has a Latin meaning, which is "to lead astray" it can be viewed negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (1996) ''The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual attraction===
{{Main|Sexual attraction}}
Sexual attraction is [[Attractiveness|attraction]] on the basis of [[sexual desire]] or the quality of arousing such interest.&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract the sexual or [[erotic]] interest of another person, and is a factor in [[sexual selection]] or [[mate choice]].  The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic). [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S. Intimate Relationships, 4th Edition, McGrawHill Companies.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[music video]], [[pornography]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]], [[sex work]] and other occupations.

===Legal issues===
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Human sexual activity#Legal issues|Sex and the law}}
Globally, laws regulate human sexuality in several ways, including criminalizing particular sexual behaviors, granting individuals the privacy or [[autonomy]] to make their own sexual decisions, protecting individuals with regard to equality and non-discrimination, recognizing and protecting other individual rights, as well as legislating matters regarding marriage and the family, and creating laws protecting individuals from violence, harassment, and persecution.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Mills |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Haste |first2=Polly |last3=Wood |first3=Stephen | date = 17 June 2016 | title = 1. Issues and Debates; How is sexuality regulated in law? | work = Sexuality and Social Justice: A Toolkit | location = Brighton, UK | publisher = Institute of Development Studies, Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme | url = http://www.spl.ids.ac.uk/sexuality-and-social-justice-toolkit/1-issues-and-debates/how-sexuality-regulated-law  | access-date =  17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are two fundamentally different approaches, applied in different states, regarding the way the law is used to attempt to govern a person's sexuality.  The “black letter” approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1/&gt; Both approaches are used to guide changes in the legal system of states, and both have an effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Issues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation have come to the forefront in Westerm law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to "[[come out of the closet]]" and engaging with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.&lt;ref name=Minnesota1&gt;{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archivedate=5 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual privacy====
{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}
While the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

State intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).&lt;ref name=SexualityLaw1 /&gt;

Di Stefano, Autilia Vitiello: IEEE 1855TM: The First IEEE Standard Sponsored by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society [Society Briefs]. IEEE Comp.Int. Mag. 11(4): 4-6 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; FML allows modelling a [[fuzzy logic]] system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). The designers of [[fuzzy systems]] with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855-2016 uses the [[W3C]] [[XML Schema]] definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.

Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by  adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the results of their work in a  form compatible with the [[Fuzzy Control Language]] (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of [[IEC 61131]].&lt;ref name="Di Stefano2013"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=On the Need of a Standard Language for Designing Fuzzy Systems|volume=296|pages=3–15|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5_1|issn=1434-9922|last1=Di Stefano|first1=Bruno N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcamporaLoia2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Loia|first2=Vincenzo|last3=Lee|first3=Chang-Shing|last4=Wang|first4=Mei-Hui|year=2013|title=On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5|issn=1434-9922|last1=Acampora|first1=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FML lets people code [[fuzzy systems]] through a collection of correlated semantic tags that model the components of a classical [[fuzzy controller]]—such as [[knowledge base]], [[rule base]], fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. To design a well-formed XML-based language, an  a XML schema describes an FML context-free grammar that defines name, type, and attributes that characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator ([[XSLT]]) changes this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules can convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an [[XSL]] file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers:

* XML to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control

* An XML schema to define the legal building blocks

* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations ([[XSLT]]) to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific language

IEEE 1855 was the first standard sponsored by the [[IEEE Computational Intelligence Society]].

'''The Institute of Astronomy''' of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] is a leading [[Bulgaria]]n [[research]] facility in the field of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], located in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria.

The institute co-operates closely with the other two institutions involved in the same field of research in the country - the Department of Astronomy at the Faculty of Physics of [[Sofia University]] and the Astronomical centre at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of [[Shumen University]].

It owns and operates the Bulgarian National [[Rozhen Observatory]] located at an altitude of 1750 m in the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodopi]] mountains in south-east Bulgaria, as well as the [[Belogradchik Observatory]] situated at 650 m at the foot of the [[Balkan Mountains|Western Balkan Mountains]] in north-west Bulgaria.

The institute was inaugurated in 1958 as an independent section of the larger Institute of Physics of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] by the academician Nikola Bonev. In 1995, it became a separate institute. The current{{when|date=April 2017}} director of the institute is Professor Dr. Tanyu Bonev. The deputy-director is Associate Professor Dr. Alexander Antov.

Following a reorganisation in the structure of its departments in 2010, researchers at the institute were divided into four departments: "Sun and Solar System" (head: Dr. T. Bonev), "Stars and stellar systems" (head: Dr. I. Iliev), "Galaxies" (head: Dr. B. Mihov) and "Astroinformatics" (head: Dr. V. Popov). These four replaced the previous division into seven sectors: "Sun", "Solar system", "Non-stationary stars", "Stellar atmospheres and envelopes", "Chemically peculiar stars", "Stellar clusters" and "Galaxies".

'''Krotona''' was one of three important [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] centers in the United States during the early part of the 20th century. Originally built in [[Hollywood]] during 1912, the colony was eventually relocated to [[Ojai]], [[California]] in 1926, where it operates today as the '''Krotona Institute of Theosophy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corbu2.caed.kent.edu/architronic/v8n1/v8n106.pdf |title=A Survey of Surviving Buildings of the Krotona Colony in Hollywood |accessdate=2007-10-07 |last= Willis |first= Alfred |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Located just off of [[California State Route 33|State Route 33]], the Krotona Institute holds regular classes and workshops on Theosophy, maintains an extensive library on the occult, and has a small bookstore.

The Hollywood Krotona building located at Primrose and Vista Del Mar was erected in 1919.&lt;ref name="Meares 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meares | first=Hadley | title=The Creation of Beachwood Canyon's Theosophist "Dreamland" | website=Curbed LA | date=2014-05-22 | url=https://la.curbed.com/2014/5/22/10099768/the-creation-of-beachwood-canyons-theosophist-dreamland-1 | access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants have included Annie Sullivan Knudsen (sugar cane heiress), New Yorker Grace Shaw Duff, Henry Hotchener, [[Marie Russak]], silver screen stars [[Mary Astor]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]], and record producer Joshua Rumer of Invengo Records. When the Krotonians, spurred by [[Madame Blavatsky]], found Hollywood suffocating their peace-filled theosophies, they decided to move to Ojai California and that is where they have been ever since.

It was about a year before the Primrose building went up that [[Alice Bailey]], subsequently a Theosophical and Spiritualist leader and author, moved to a "cottage on Beechwood Drive," to be near the Krotona colony, from Pacific Grove, CA, near Monterey.  She had joined the Theosophical Lodge in Pacific Grove and was teaching and holding classes.  Not long before, she tells, she had left her original traditional Christian beliefs behind and soon after "discovered" "that there was a great and divine Plan," and that there are those "who are responsible for the working out of that Plan" by leading mankind, "stage by stage," down the centuries.  This "hierarchy of spiritual leaders" she calls the "Masters of the Wisdom," and they all report to and work with Christ, Jesus of Nazareth.  Her own Master, Lord K. H. or Koot Hoomi, had made visits to her every few years, starting she said in 1895, this being one of his many duties in his role as a pupil or assistant to the Christ.  K. H. was a master of love-wisdom.  Bailey said about 500 people were then part of the Krotona community, some living on the premises, and she began work there by emptying the garbage.  Soon she worked in the vegetarian kitchen and noted that some of the vegetarians felt smugly superior to carnivores, while others had no such notions.  She remained with the Theosophical Society until 1920.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1951"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Alice |title=The unfinished autobiography of Alice A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">In the [[philosophy of science]], under the [[correspondence principle]], a '''limiting case''' [[theory]] is an earlier theory which becomes incorporated into a later, usually broader theory; that is to say, the earlier (limiting case) theory proves to be a special or limited case of the later theory. Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that [[classical mechanics]] constitutes a low-energy limiting case of [[relativity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivadulla, Andres: [https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/481-2013-10-14-TheNewtonianLimit.pdf The Newtonian Limit of Relativity Theory and the Rationality of Theory Change], Synthese 141:417–429, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladyman, James (2013): "Toward a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience", in ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience'', Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In words of [[Larry Laudan]], [[scientific realism|realist]] philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory "T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be a limiting case of [the theory] T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only if (a) ''all'' the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are assigned a value by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as, or very close to, the values T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions—consistent with T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—are specified".

The idea that a theory (in our previous example, [[Newtonian mechanics]]) that is close to being true (i.e., that is [[verisimil]]) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, [[relativistic mechanics]]) can be an argument for [[scientific realism]], as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">The '''{{Lang|de|Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis}}''' (MWV) (German for '''Mendelssohn Work Index''') is the first modern fully researched [[Catalogues of classical compositions#Comprehensive catalogues|music catalogue]] of the works of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. It appeared in 2009 under the auspices of the [[Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (SAW) under the leadership of the German music scholar Ralf Wehner, and is published by the firm of [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] as part of the "Leipzig Edition of the Works of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy".&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (2009), pp. 77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelssohn himself only allocated [[opus number]]s up to 72 for his published works, with further numbers up to 121 being added posthumously. Moreover, none of Mendelssohn's earlier works including his 12 [[String symphonies (Mendelssohn)|string symphonies]] or his operas, had any defined opus numbers. The MWV "conflates the known works into 26 groups and assigns a distinct MWV number to each of the works. Within each group, the works are ordered chronologically."&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''modello''' {{IPA-it|moˈdɛllo|}} (plural '''modelli'''), from Italian,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modello'' avoids the ambiguity in English of ''model'', which may equally refer to the finished [[work of art]] that provided detailed inspiration for a variant or later copy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Modello Glossary, National Gallery, London]; Irene Earls; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAdrziNnqLIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U36ePp8oMeVe0otIfoYZyo8eDz0Yw ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in art circles in [[Tuscany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376–1508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, "A Note on the Word Modello', ''The Art Bulletin'' '''74'''.1 (March 1992:172–173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the [[Marche]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are "[[oil sketch]]" (''schizzo'') and "[[cartoon]]" for [[painting]]s or [[stained glass]], [[maquette]], plastico or bozzetto&lt;ref&gt;A ''bozzetto'' is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; for sculpture or architecture, or [[architectural model]].&lt;ref&gt;Fourteenth century uses of ''modello'' in connection with [[Santa Reparata, Florence]], are noted in A. Grote, ''Studien zur Geschichte der Opera Santa Reparata zu Florenz in Vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' (Munich 1960:113ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra&lt;ref&gt;The Latin term ''modulus'', a synonym of ''typus'', "[[archetype]]" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan [[Accademia della Crusca]]'s early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also [[Donor portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of buildings they had constructed—"models" in the familiar modern sense—''modello'' is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelangelo]] was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio ''modelli'' done to his specifications: "in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as [[Tommaso de' Cavallieri]]", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes "A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'" ''Master Drawings'' '''26'''.3 (Autumn 1988:239–248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of ''modello'' for the lost original of two copies in public collections. In the case of architectural ''modelli'', the actual construction could be by craftsmen from drawings by the architect. A discussion about a [[Hieronymous Bosch]] drawing that illustrates when the term is appropriate to use is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 note 23 on page 21] of: J.O. Hand &amp; M. Wolff, ''Early Netherlandish Painting'', National Gallery of Art, Washington catalogue (Cambridge UP), 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-34016-0}}; the correspondence concerning the appropriateness or not of ''modello'' applied by Michael Hirst to presentation drawings by [[Michelangelo]] that were "done expressly for patronal approval, criticism or rejection" (Hirst, ''Michelangelo and His Drawings'', 1988:79) is noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; The&lt;span id="Ricordo" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding heading-less link-target is linked to by [[Ricordi]] and [[Ricordo]] --&gt; less frequently found term '''ricordo''' (Italian for "record" or "memory") means a similar piece produced as a small copy ''after'' completion of the work as a record for the workshop.&lt;ref&gt;A small finished bronze representing a completed sculpture on a reduced scale, made for a [[connoisseur]] or the art market, is a ''reduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the ''ricordo'' for the [[prime version]] might serve in the atelier as the ''modello'' for the subsequent ones.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Brown, Richard G. Mann; ''Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue'', National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40107-0}}. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 last paragraph of p.73], the view is advanced that an [[El Greco]] was produced as a ''ricordo'' for the first version of a work, and then used as the ''modello'' for a second version.&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. 

The [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] at right was catalogued as a modello by [[Michael Levey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''The 17th and 18th century Italian Schools; National Gallery Catalogues'', p.223, 1971, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-901791-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent [[x-ray]] investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its [[underpainting]] it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the [[Courtauld Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Braham Helen, ''The Princes Gate Collection'', p. 74, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, {{ISBN|0-904563-04-9}} [http://www.courtauldprints.com/image.php?id=147902&amp;idx=1&amp;fromsearch=true Courtauld Institute image] – note this is reversed compared to the final painting.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886961 Francisco Bayeu. Saragossa; Review of Exhibition] by Xavier Bray, [[The Burlington Magazine]], Vol. 138, No. 1120 (Jul., 1996), p. 479, note 3. JSTOR – on free page&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery still describe it as "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6273 National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghiberticompetition.jpg|thumb|left|''Sacrifice of Isaac''; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s successful competition modello for the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Brunelleschi%20Filippo/imagepages/image2.html Brunelleschi's unsuccessful version]. Both are in the [[Bargello]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Cartoon", named for the sturdy ''cartone'' paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale,&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons for [[tapestry]] were always at full scale; often cut into loom-width strips, they were set behind the warps of the loom as a direct guide for the weavers. The most famous tapestry cartoons are the "[[Raphael Cartoons]]" conserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; they were re-used in the 17th century in England to produce series of [[Mortlake|Mortlake tapestries]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms ''cartoon'' and ''working drawing'' are often used interchangeably. ''Modello'' is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or [[watercolour]], or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term '''modeletto''' will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, ''modello'' may be printed in [[italic type|italic]]s, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, the word does not appear in the original ''[[OED]]'' or the First Supplement of 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the word, ''modèle'', may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.

Especially in the case of oil sketches, many ''modelli'' are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in "preparatory drawings" or "studies", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.

[[File:Passignano Michelangelo che da il modellino di San Pietro a Paolo IV.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] shows [[Pope Julius II]] his ''modellino'' of St Peter's in this 19th-century artist's impression]]
An example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Rosso Fiorentino]]: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, "un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo."&lt;ref&gt;"A most beautiful ''modello'' of all the works, which is today in our houses in Arezzo."&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary ''modello colorito'' in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of [[Illusionistic ceiling|illusionistic ''sotto-in-su'' perspectives]] on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as [[Andrea Pozzo]], the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (1700–17)&lt;ref&gt;In vol. II, section "Breve instruttione per dipingere a fresco", noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]]. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] won, beating six other artists, including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Jacopo della Quercia]]; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named ([[Bargello]] – picture above).

There are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including [[St Peter's, Rome]] and the "Great Model" of [[St Paul's Cathedral, London]], showing a different design by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] from that actually built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explore-stpauls.net/oct03/textMM/TriforumGreatModelN.htm Explore St Paul's – Wren's Great Model]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.

Boorstin|author=Boorstin, Daniel J. |title=[[The Discoverers]]|publisher= Random House |place=New York|year= 1983|isbn=978-0-394-72625-0 |page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next major figure in the development of archaeology was [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Adam |title=Creating Prehistory: Druids, Ley Hunters and Archaeologists in Pre-War Britain |location=Malden and Oxford |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4051-5505-2 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved on by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology |last=Hawkes |first=Jacquetta |year=1982 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-297-78056-4 |pages=149–151, 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tessa Verney Wheeler: Women and Archaeology Before World War Two |last=Carr |first=Lydia C. |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-964022-5 |pages=172-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two constant themes in their attempts to improve archaeological excavation were first, to maintain strict stratigraphic control while excavating (for this purpose, the baulks between trenches served to retain a record of the strata that had been dug through), and second, to publish a record of the excavation promptly and in a form that would tell the story of the site to the intelligent reader.

Bomb damage during the Second World War and subsequent rebuilding gave archaeologists the opportunity to meaningfully examine inhabited cities for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler |last=Piggott |first=Stuart |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |publisher=The Royal Society |volume=23 |year=1977 |jstor=769628 |page=635 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1977.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombed sites provided windows onto the development of European cities whose pasts had been buried beneath working buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology |last=Hawkes |first=Jacquetta |year=1982 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-297-78056-4 |pages=192-194}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban archaeology]] necessitated a new approach as centuries of human occupation had created deep layers of stratigraphy that could often only be seen through the keyholes of individual building plots. In Britain, post-war archaeologists such as [[W. F. Grimes]] and [[Martin Biddle]] took the initiative in studying this previously unexamined area and developed the archaeological methods now employed in much cultural resource management and [[rescue archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle |first1=Martin |last2=Hudson |first2=Daphne M |title=Future of London's Past|date= 1 April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology increasingly became a professional activity during the first half of the 20th century. Although the bulk of an excavation's workforce would still consist of volunteers, it would normally be led by a professional. It was now possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and other schools, and by the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates of such programs.

==New technology==
Undoubtedly the major technological development in 20th century archaeology was the introduction of [[radiocarbon dating]], based on a theory first developed by American scientist [[Willard Libby]] in 1949. Despite its many limitations (compared to later methods it is inaccurate; it can only be used on organic matter; it is reliant on a dataset to calibrate it; and it only works with remains from the last 10,000 years), the technique brought about a revolution in archaeological understanding. For the first time, it was possible to put reasonably accurate dates on discoveries such as bones. This in some cases led to a complete reassessment of the significance of past finds. Classic cases included the [[Red Lady of Paviland]]. It was not until 1989 that the Catholic Church allowed the technique to be used on the [[Turin Shroud]], indicating that the linen fibres were of medieval origin.

Other developments, often spin-offs from wartime technology, led to other scientific advances. For field archaeologists, the most significant of these was the use of the [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]. This encompasses a number of [[remote sensing]] techniques, such as [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]]. Also used is [[LIDAR|light detection and ranging (LIDAR)]], a technology that measures the height of the ground surface and other features in large areas of landscape with resolution and accuracy that was not previously available. Subsurface remote sensing techniques such as [[magnetometry]] and [[ground-penetrating radar]] enable an advanced picture to be built up of what lies beneath the soil before excavation even commences. The entire Roman town of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]], modern day [[Wroxeter]], has been surveyed by these methods, though only a small portion has actually been excavated.  The application of physical sciences to archaeology, known as archaeometry or [[archaeological science]], is now a major part of archaeology.

Archaeology has also come to use [[Geographic Information System|geographic information systems]], designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize all types of geospatial data.

The discovery in 1991 in the [[Ötztaler Alpen|Ötztaler Alps]] of the prehistorical mummy dubbed [[Ötzi]] resulted in the techniques of [[genetics]] being brought to bear on archaeological science. With the help of [[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]], scholars were able to ascertain that Ötzi does not belong to any known human population. In the subsequent years, genetics has helped us reconstruct human migrations that occurred during prehistory.

The '''Mundaneum''' is a non profit organisation based in [[Mons]], [[Belgium]] that runs an exhibition space, website and archive which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum established by [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=MES&gt;{{cite web|title=Mundaneum Exhibition Space|url=http://expositions.mundaneum.org/en|website=Mundaneum|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Mundaneum''' was  created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine,&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |date=March 12, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/technology/google-to-announce-venture-with-belgian-museum.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global |title=Google to Announce Venture With Belgian Museum |author=Eric Pfanner}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their work on [[documentation science]]. Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial, meaning "world palace" in English, and it occupied the left wing of the [[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]], a government building in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Heuvel|first1=Charles|editor1-last=Rayward|editor1-first=W. Boyd|title=Information Beyond Borders: International Cultural and Intellectual Exchange in the Belle Époque|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317116790|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5C43DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT315&amp;dq=%22Palais%20Mondial%22%20mundaneum&amp;pg=PT315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Dynamics of Networks and of Decimal Classification Systems, 1905-1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aimed to gather together all the world's [[knowledge]] and classify it according to a system they developed called the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which was the origin of the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA).

The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Wolfram | title = Alpha | url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/docs/timeline/computable-knowledge-history-5.html | contribution = Computable knowledge History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP USA| isbn = 9780199931415| last = Wright| first = Alex| title = Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age| location = Oxford ; New York| date = 2014-07-10| pages = 8–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otlet regarded the project as the centrepiece of a new 'world city'—a centrepiece which eventually became an [[archive]] with more than 12 million [[index card]]s and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the [[Internet]] (or, perhaps more appropriately, of systematic knowledge projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[WolframAlpha]]) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes.

An English pamphlet published in 1914 described it:

{{quote |The International Centre organises collections of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives.  These collections are conceived as parts of one universal body of documentation, as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects.  Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W Boyd | last = Rayward | url = http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm | contribution = Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Hypertext | title = Jasis | volume = 45 | year = 1994 | pages = 235–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Mundaneum was originally housed at the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Palais du Cinquantenaire]] in [[Brussels]] (Belgium). This was originally renamed Palais Mondial, before the name Mundaneum was adopted. Otlet commissioned architect [[Le Corbusier]] to design a Mundaneum project to be built in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in 1929.  Although never built, the project triggered the [[Mundaneum Affair]], a theoretical argument between Corbusier and Czech critic and architect [[Karel Teige]].

In 1933, with Otlet's agreement, [[Otto Neurath]] founded the Mundaneum Institute as a branch in [[The Hague]] in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegselmann|first=Rainer|article=Introduction|title=Unified Science|date=1987|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became central to his activities when he moved to the [[Netherlands]] as a refugee following the defeat of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]]. In 1936 the Mundaneum Institute launched the [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neurath|first=Otto|article=An International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1936)|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Robert S.|editor2-last=Neurath|editor2-first=Marie|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophical papers 1913-1946|date=1983|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht|page=139|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium in 1940, the Mundaneum was replaced with an exhibit of [[Art of the Third Reich|Third Reich art]], and some material was lost.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

The Mundaneum was reconstituted in a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]].
It remained there until it was forced to move again in 1972.

The Mundaneum has since been relocated to a converted 1930s department store in [[Mons]] ([[Wallonia]]), where the existing museum opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

Oral sex is often regarded as [[taboo]],&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice.

==Practice==
[[File:Wiki-fellatio.png|thumb|Female performing fellatio]]
Oral sex may be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]].

===Sexual variants===
[[Facesitting]] is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called [[69 (sex position)|"sixty-nine" position]]. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] may cause different sexual stimulations. [[Autofellatio]] is a possible but rare variant; [[autocunnilingus]] may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.

An act of [[group sex]] restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a ''gangsuck'', ''blowbang'' or ''lineup'', all derivatives of the slang term ''[[gang bang]]'' for group sex. [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] may also involve oral sex.

===Preserving virginity===

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes [[Sexual intercourse|penile-vaginal sex]]).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002| pages = 1920–1921 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liUcCPXcpAAC&amp;pg=PA1920|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

Oral sex alone cannot result in pregnancy and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"&gt;{{cite book | title = Our Sexuality | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | pages = 286–289 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=MpRnPtmdRVwC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286|quote=Noncoital forms of sexual intimacy, which have been called outercourse, can be a viable form of birth control.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conception to take place, [[sperm]] from the [[human penis|penis]] must enter the [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s and fertilize the female's [[Ovum|egg]]. In humans, there is no connection between the [[gastrointestinal system]] and the [[reproductive system]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;However, this has happened in [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/teen-girl-vagina-pregnant-sperm-survival-oral-sex/story?id=9732562 bizarre circumstances] involving a stabbing.&lt;/ref&gt; and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by [[acid]]s in her [[stomach]] and [[protein]]s in the [[small intestine]]. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of [[nutrient]]s. However, there is a potential risk of pregnancy if [[semen]] comes in contact with the [[vagina]]l area in some way, such as semen in the [[ejaculate]] finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.

Oral sex is not necessarily an effective method of preventing [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), although some forms of STIs are believed to be less commonly spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name="testing"&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/health/testing/geffen_sti.html Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet].

Oral sex should be limited to the protected areas. A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a [[condom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/dental-dams "How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom"], UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or a latex or [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile glove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.about.com/od/prevention/ht/dentaldamhowto.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Dental Dam From a Condom|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but using a real dental dam is seen as preferable; this is because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by "slipping" outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission. Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a/plastic-wrap-oral-sex.htm|title=Plastic Wrap and Oral Sex|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation.

===Prevalence===
A report issued in September 2005 by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered [[statistical survey|survey]] of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the teenagers questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is "on the rise", this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.&lt;ref name="lemonick"&gt;Lemonick, Michael D., [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1106324,00.html "A Teen Twist on Sex"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', New York, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated in 2009: "Studies indicate that oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents."&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Research also indicates that "males are more likely than females to have received oral sex, whereas equal proportions of men and women have given oral sex."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

==Health risks and other studies==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Pratt| title = HIV &amp; AIDS: A Foundation for Nursing and Healthcare Practice | publisher = [[CRC Press]]|pages=306| isbn = 0340706392|year=2003| accessdate = August 21, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=naSG-2RgRiYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and Society, Volume 1|isbn =0761479066|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2009–2010|page=61|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at [[Malmö University]]'s Faculty of Odontology suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the [[cancer]] patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.

Another study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' suggests a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between oral sex and [[head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Miscarriage reduction===
Fellatio may reduce the risk of [[miscarriage]]s by inducing [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|immunological tolerance]] in the woman by exposure to the proteins in her partner's semen, a process known as [[paternal tolerance]]. While any exposure to a partner's semen appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, immunological tolerance could be most quickly established through the oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen.&lt;ref name="pmid10706945"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''| date=February 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform fellatio and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, "the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory" behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal immunological tolerance necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
[[File:Fellatio.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Fellatio]] in [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] ]]
{{See also|Cunnilingus|Fellatio}}

Cultural views on oral sex range from aversion to high regard.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; It, especially fellatio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html "The History of Fellatio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143842/http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html |date=May 24, 2006 }}, ''Salon.com'', May 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; has been considered [[taboo]], or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Laws of some jurisdictions regard oral sex as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice itself, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], fellatio was considered profoundly taboo.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two [[Latin]] words for the act: ''irrumare'' (to penetrate orally), and ''fellare'' (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have [[Halitosis|foul breath]] and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"/&gt;

In contrast to historical views on fellatio, cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice in Chinese [[Taoism]], which regards it as having the ability to enhance [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Paz (1969) ''Conjunctions and Disjunctions''; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Western culture]], oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents&lt;ref name="lemonick"/&gt; and adults.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buschmiller|first=Rev. Robert|title=Oral Sex in Marriage|url=http://www.presentationministries.com/brochures/OralSex.asp|publisher=Presentation Ministries|accessdate=November 22, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206194539/http://www.presentationministries.com/publications/OralSex.asp|archivedate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice,&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pina"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2804438|last=Pina-Cabral|first=Joao de|title=Tamed Violence: Genital Symbolism is Portuguese popular culture|journal=Man|year=1992|volume=28|issue=1|series=N.S|pages=101–120|jstor=2804438}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Pina"/&gt; Opposite these views, people also believe that oral sex "is one of the most intimate behaviors that a couple can engage in because it requires total trust and vulnerability."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

While commonly believed that [[lesbian sexual practices]] involve cunnilingus for all [[women who have sex with women]] (WSW), some have an aversion to cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

==Terminology and slang==
There are many words which refer to oral sex, including [[euphemism]]s and [[sexual slang]]. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones being:

* Giving head – A common slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is ''giving head'', from the term ''head job'' (in contrast to ''[[hand job]]'', manual stimulation). A play on the slang term ''head'' resulted in the slang term ''brains'', or ''brain salad surgery'', ''domes'' or ''getting domes.''
* Plate – A once common [[British English|British]] [[rhyming slang]] for ''fellate'' that arose in the gay slang language of [[Polari]] that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ Polari]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181306/http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as ''muff diving'', ''eating out'' or ''poon-job'', a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of ''[[blow job]]'', where ''poon'' is short for ''poontang'' or ''punani''.
* Additionally, in lesbian culture, several common slang terms used are ''carpet munching'', ''giving lip'', ''lip service'' or ''[[Tipping the Velvet|tipping the velvet]]'' (a faux-"Victorian" expression invented by novelist [[Sarah Waters]]).

Other slang terms for oral sex include ''going down on'' (male or female), ''licking out'' and ''muff diving'' (female), ''blow job'' (male), ''dome'' (male or female), ''sucking off'' (male), ''playing the skin flute'' (male recipient), ''rolling cigars'' (male recipient), ''lolly-gagging'' (gay male-on-male), ''gaining knowledge'' (male recipient) and ''bust down'' (male). Forced fellatio is often called ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10586">In [[political science]], [[political economy|political economics]], and [[peace and conflict studies]], referring to the [[military–industrial complex]], the '''peace–industrial complex''' defines the industry and economy derived from [[international development|development]], [[peacemaking]], [[peacebuilding]], and [[conflict resolution]] at both the domestic and foreign levels. While some scholars (Seiberling 1972) argue that the peace–industrial complex must oppose the military-industrial complex, others (Aberkane 2012) argue it is destined to become its natural, peaceful evolution, and further call it the "military-industrial complex 2.0". The latter argue the peace-industrial complex more precisely consists of turning military [[research and development]] into civilian technology as systematically as possible. Although it has been discussed in more recent times the concept was introduced as early as in 1969 by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to the War Against War ==

=== Origin of the Peace-industrial complex ===
At least two approaches to the [[War Against War]] may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or [[Anti-war movement]] on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of [[William James]]' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the [[UNESCO]], that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech [[Martin Luther King]] further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane):

{{cquote| We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s. The Sirens had the ability to sing so sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer [[Orpheus]] whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens. When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-lecture.html Martin Luther King, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 11th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|200px| Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964]]

Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible [[war profiteering]], thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the military-industrial complex rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex.

[[File:John F. Seiberling 93rd Congress 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px| US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex]]

In 1986 [[Keith Suter|Keith D. Suter]] defended his Ph.D dissertation on ''Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex'',&lt;ref&gt;Suter, K. D.  Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex, Ph.D Thesis, Deakin University, Victoria, 1986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAcNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was further cited in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, R. Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Peace–industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ83AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: "It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex". It received further citation throughout the 1970s. The notion appeared in the '[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|United States Congress House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;National science policy and priorities act of 1972: Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, second session U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972 p.153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a congressional address by US [[John F. Seiberling|Rep. J.F. Seiberling]] (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Rep. J. F. Seiberling, "The case for economic conversion" Congressional record v.118, n°95, 13 June 1972, pp E6177-6179, cited in Science Policy Reviews, Volumes 4 à 5 Battelle Memorial Institute, 1972 p. 398 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK], see also Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress, Volume 118, Part 16 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972 p.20738 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G20Udh7ynykC&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter further defended that "each country create a national Ministry for Peace",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i4pinternational.org/files/202/7.+national+ministries+for+peace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was contemporary to the creation of the Ministry for Peace Australia (MFPA) initiative and the Global Alliance for Ministries &amp; Infrastructures for Peace (GAMIP). An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Transcendentist school ===
If Kofi J. Roberts&lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing of federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, [[Idriss Aberkane|Idriss J. Aberkane]] further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the "military-industrial complex 2.0" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace-industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls "weapons of mass construction" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and [[soft power]] than weapons of mass destruction.

{{cquote| every time a military technology makes it to civilian use it changes the world for good and what it brings you is love rather than hatred, for if you project destruction you're gonna be hated, if you project construction, you're gonna be loved. So what is power, truly, what is a [[superpower]]? Is it a nation that has [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]? No it is not! Many nations have weapons of mass destruction they are not all superpowers (...) when you're looking at [[The Pentagon]] you're looking at a [[Military budget of the United States|budget]] of 740 billion US dollars, that's the budget of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] plus de [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget#Discretionary spending|discretionary budget]] that is allocated to Research and Development for defense. I'm not saying we should take it away from the Pentagon, I say we should move to the Pentagon 2.0. For so far, what has America gained in projecting every bits of these dollars? Every time America uses these dollars is it more loved? Is it more respected? Is it safer? Is it more trusted? Does it have more leadership? (...) America could project this money to gain love, respect, leadership and political power. This, is the military-industrial complex 2.0. [It] will be interested in weapons of mass construction rather than weapons of mass destruction because these weapons are the future in terms of power. For what was the power of the 20th century? In the 20th century power was [[Nuclear winter|the ability to go from a beautiful blue planet to a red one]]. If you could turn a blue planet into a red one you were powerful. We have the technology to do that, these (sic) are called weapons of mass destruction. Do we have the technology to go the other way around? Can we [[Terraforming|turn a red planet - Mars in that case - into a beautiful green planet]]? We can't but when you're looking at a budget of seven hundred billions US dollars you can look into that. This is gonna be 21st century power, weapons of mass construction. Why? because if you project these weapons I guarantee you people are gonna love you&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLIzupsfiV8 Aberkane, Bring on the Peace-Industrial Complex, Wikistage Paris 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution''' (S-CAR) is a division of [[George Mason University]] based near [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]] with locations in Arlington, Fairfax, and Lorton, Virginia.

== History ==
S-CAR was founded in 1981 as the Center for Conflict Analysis, later named the Center for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (CCAR) and began offering a master's degree in Conflict Analysis and Resolution in 1983.  In 1988 it became the first academic institution to grant PhD's in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and rose to the status of Institute, becoming ICAR in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-then-and-now-institute-turns-25-years-old |title=ICAR Then and Now: The Institute Turns 25 Years Old |publisher=S-CAR News, Special Issue: Point of View |date=February 2008|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after a decade of growth and development, including the introduction of the undergraduate program and graduate certificate programs, it became the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution (S-CAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/icar-becomes-school-reflections-past-and-looking-future |title=ICAR Becomes a School: Reflections on the past and looking to the future |publisher=S-CAR News, Volume 5, Issue 1 |date=February 2011|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1899, university professors from around Canada came to St. Andrews over the summer months to do field research work at Canada’s first marine biological station, which, at the time, was a floating scow.&lt;ref name="PhotoAlbum2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/e0006539|title=SABS Photo Album|date=2010-11-29|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, permanent installations of the biological station were established with the main laboratory, a residence building, and an attic.&lt;ref name="pipsc.ca" /&gt; There were long working tables, and storage area for materials and supplies. Dr. [[Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman]] was the Curator from 1912 to 1921 and Director from 1921 until 1933. The main lab was destroyed by fire in 1932 and replaced the following year by a fireproof lab, part of the complex that houses the SABS' library.&lt;ref name="PhotoAlbum2010" /&gt; After establishing the first freshwater biological research station in Canada at [[Gimli, Manitoba]] in 1929, the fisheries biologist Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov came to work at SABS in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="mhs.mb.ca2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/bajkov_ad.shtml|title=Memorable Manitobans: Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov (1895-1955)|date=5 May 2009|work=mhs.mb.ca|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a contract was awarded to construct a new [[wet laboratory]] building through consolidation of existing buildings into one state of the art wet lab facility that will house the majority of marine life and research operations; completion is expected by June 2012.&lt;ref name="news.gc.ca2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?crtr.sj1D=&amp;mthd=advSrch&amp;crtr.mnthndVl=12&amp;nid=445369|title=Modernization of the St. Andrews Biological Station continues with a contract for construction of new wet laboratory|date=April 24, 2009|publisher=Canada News Centre|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The station's research includes aquaculture, oceanography, the sustainability of fisheries, stock assessments, aquatic environment, species at risk, and the biology of commercially harvested fish. SABS maintains a reservoir.&lt;ref name="reliablepower.ca" /&gt; It provides several services such as saltwater, freshwater and chemistry labs; quarantine water and marine fish rearing facilities; and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]. Minimal incubator spaces are available at SABS but they are available at the adjacent Huntsman Marine Science Centre.&lt;ref name="fptt-pftt.gc.ca" /&gt; One of the labs studies [[Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture|Multi-trophic Aquaculture]], growing different species in the same containers.&lt;ref name="pipsc.ca" /&gt; 

The St. Andrews Biological Station Library did contain the world’s largest collection of [[Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecozone (CEC) |northwest Atlantic]] material.&lt;ref name="pipsc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pipsc.ca/portal/page/portal/website/news/magazine/autumn07/St.%20Andrews%20Biological%20Station|title=St. Andrews Biological Station – Celebrating 100 Years of Ocean Research|publisher=The Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has collections in the areas of aquaculture, environmental chemistry,  environmental sciences, marine biology, ocean sciences, population ecology, and toxicology.

'''Stewart Russell''' (6 August 1955 – 17 September 2011) was a senior lecturer and interdisciplinary researcher in Science, Technology and Innovation Studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Innovative in his approach, Stewart believed that to achieve sustainable change it was necessary to address the interplay between science and technology and social and institutional factors. He worked with a diverse communities including trade unions, government and public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Stewart Russell|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=417803|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in physical science from Pembroke College, Cambridge, UK, Stewart made a sharp turn towards social science and took a PhD in the Technology Policy Unit of [[Aston University]], UK. He dedicated the rest of his career to exploring the challenges of environmental sustainability across a range of technological fields.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Stewart Russell obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/oct/23/stewart-russell-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2012|location=London|first=Robin|last=Williams|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he accepted a position as lecturer in Science, Technology and Society at the [[University of Wollongong]], in New South Wales, Australia. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 to join the University of Edinburgh as deputy director of the Research Centre for Social Sciences. In this role he helped build the interdisciplinary research programmes of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]], and bring together the Research Centre for Social Studies and Science Studies Unit as the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group. Collaborating with the [[National Museum of Scotland]] Stewart developed the innovative "Understanding Technology" public lecture series.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stewart Russell - About - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225145734/http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures are continued and held to commemorate his contribution.

On 30 March 2012 a symposium was held to celebrate his contribution to the academic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart Russell Symposium|url=http://www.issti.ed.ac.uk/news_and_events/stewart_russell_symposium|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Stewart Russell Memorial Fund to support students at the University of Edinburgh was established to commemorate his commitment and passion in helping students achieve their full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stewart Russell Award for MSc (Research) Science and Technology Studies - News - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/news/2014/stewart_russell_award_for_msc_research_science_and_technology_studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taplow Court''' is a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house in the village of [[Taplow]]  in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], which has served as the national headquarters for the [[Soka Gakkai International]] of the United Kingdom (SGI-UK) since 1988.

==Locale==
The [[Taplow burial]], a 7th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] burial mound, is in the grounds of the house, near the [[parish church]] which is scenically positioned  on a hill directly above [[Maidenhead Bridge]] and the town's riverside district. The mound was excavated in 1883 and a number of treasures were discovered, of quality of the early Saxon centuries surpassed only by [[Sutton Hoo]] in 1939.

==Manor House==
There has been a manor house on the site since before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. The manor was owned by the monks at [[Merton Priory]] until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. It was then owned by the [[Hampson Baronets|Hampson family]] in the 17th century, coming under attack during the [[English Civil War]]. Throughout  the 18th century and through to the 1850s, Taplow Court was home to the [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl and Countess of Orkney]] who has also owned the adjacent [[Cliveden]].

===19th Century Rebuilding===
From 1852, Taplow Court became the home of the Grenfell family, purchased by [[Charles Pascoe Grenfell]] in August of that year.&lt;ref name="Sheahan1862"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheahan|first=James Joseph|title=History and topography of Buckinghamshire: comprising a general survey of the county, preceded by an epitome of the early history of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9oWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA852|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=1862|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|isbn=978-0-8048-3390-5|page=852}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family had it rebuilt in 1855, as it is dated, etched into the masonry. The exterior in an early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]] and the interior (with its central glazed hall rising the full height of the house) in [[Romanesque architecture]]. A [[listed building]] in the starting category of Grade II, it is built of red brick partly dressed in light stone and has a slate roof, has four storeys with 2 stone [[stringcourse]]s carried round the building as drip moulds over the windows. It has a central projection with a porch. Here its heavy oak door is set in recess with a [[Norman architecture|Norman style arch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1165286|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:taplow court inside.jpg|thumb|An interior room at Taplow Court]]

It was inherited in 1867 by his grandson [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough]] where a prominent social role was also played by [[Ethel Fane|his wife Ettie]].&lt;ref name=ettie&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/ettie-by-richard-davenport-hines-1785255.html Ettie], book review, The Independent, Retrieved 1 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Their son was war poet [[Julian Grenfell]].  They prominently hosted an aristocratic and elite group known as "[[the Souls]]" at the house. Visitors included [[Henry Irving]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Edward VII]] when [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Patrick Shaw-Stewart|Patrick Shaw Stewart]], [[Edith Wharton]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].

A [[stické]] court was built by Lord Desborough at Taplow Court in 1892 and the dimension of this court subsequently became the standard size of the court.

After [[World War II]], Taplow Court was owned by British Telecommunications Research, a subsidiary of [[Plessey|Plessey Electronics]] until 1988 when it became a [[Soka Gakkai International]] Buddhist centre.

'''''The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Knowledge''''', under the editorship of Dr. [[Norman Haire]] (1892&amp;ndash;1952), is the first of a trilogy of sexual encyclopaedias by [[Arthur Koestler]] writing under the pen name of ‘Dr. A. Costler’. It is the English version, published by Koestler's cousin Francis Aldor in 1934, of the book ''L'encyclopédie de la vie sexuelle'' that Koestler in 1933 wrote, together with "A. Willy" (the pseudonym of his other cousin Willy Aldor) and the German Dr. Levy-Lenz. The second book is ''[[Sexual Anomalies and Perversions, Physical and Psychological Development, Diagnoses and Treatment]]''. The title of the third book is, in the original French edition of 1939, ''[[L’Encyclopédie de la famille]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Koestler: ''The Invisible Writing'' pp. 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; This third book was subsequently translated into English and published under various titles and with changes to the structure and text of the original edition. The name of ‘Dr. Costler’ (or 'A. Coester') as the author or co-author of the book is omitted from later editions.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''The Encyclopaedia of Sex Practice'', Second Edition, by Drs. [[Norman Haire]], A. Willy, L. Vander, O. Fischer, R. Lothar and others, London: Encyclopaedic Press Ltd., 1951, 836 pages. See also the interesting study of Michael Scammell, ''Koestler. The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic'', Random House, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The first book contained chapters by two other authors; the second I wrote alone; the third contained chapters by [[Manès Sperber]] (who had been a practising Psychotherapist before he made his reputation as a novelist).&lt;ref&gt;''The Invisible Writing'', footnote pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Koestler wrote that working from standard text books and reference works "I condensed and distilled the ''Encyclopædia'' at a rate of about four thousand words a day."&lt;ref&gt;''The Invisible Wring'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The background to Koestler’s collaboration in the writing of these books is set out in detail in his autobiography ''[[The Invisible Writing]]'', Chapter XIX. ‘Introducing Dr. Coster’. As noted there, The Encyclopœdia was highly successful and became a best-seller in several languages, but Koestler himself had little benefit of it, being shamelessly exploited by the publisher &amp;ndash; a crooked cousin of his. Koestler received a flat payment of sixty pounds and no royalties from the sales, which amounted to tens of thousands. 

== Contents ==
The book is divided into ten ‘Books’ (main chapters) and two Appendices. Each ‘Book’ consists of several Sections and Chapters. The book contains numerous monochrome illustrations and 32 colour plates. 836 numbered pages.

'''''The Last Mixed Tape''''' is an Irish based daily [[music blog]] founded in February 2014 by critic and journalist Stephen White. The site is composed of reviews, interviews, and news features all written by White, specifically about the Dublin music scene. Although the site is listed as a blog, White has on several occasions distanced himself from the term, preferring to be called a "critic".

The website promotes and critiques the artists coming out of Ireland's independent scene, spanning several genres including [[Indie Music|indie]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[post punk]], [[noise pop]] and [[alternative rock]].

==Writing Style &amp; Criticism==
Although White champions Irish indie music, he has been known to be harder on pop acts coming out of the country resulting in a controversial rant about Irish act [[Kodaline]] in which he likened them to "vanilla ice-cream".&lt;ref name="kodaline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/the-last-mixed-tape/episodes/the-last-mixed-tape-podcast-episode-two |title=  The Last Mixed Tape Podcast Episode Two | publisher= podccastchart.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also expressed his dislike of [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] and referred to his debut album as "uncontrollably melodramatic",&lt;ref name=podcast /&gt; a view not shared by his peers. This has continued to earn the Last Mixed Tape a controversial reputation within the Irish music scene with White's reviews of [[The Coronas]] album 'Trust The Wire' and [[The Strypes]] album 'Spitting Image' being seen as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelastmixedtape.com/2017/06/17/review-the-strypes-spitting-image/|title=Review {{!}} The Strypes – Spitting Image|date=2017-06-17|website=The Last Mixed Tape|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Last Mixed Tape continued to earn a negative reputation following a review of [[The Script|the Script’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Freedom Child]] album, which was described as “toxic” and left “a bad taste”.

==Awards and nominations==
Since its first year ''the Last Mixed Tape'' was nominated for six music blogging awards, the Blog Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016&lt;ref name="blogawards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.blogawardsireland.com/best-music-blog-finalists-2014/ |title=  Blog Awards Best Music Blog 2014 Finalists | publisher= blogawardsireland.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Web Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016, losing out on all occasions.&lt;ref name="webawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webawards.ie/2014-finalists/ |title=  Web Awards 2014 Finalists | publisher= webawards.ie |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances and events==
''The Last Mixed Tape'' has also taken part in several events and charity shows around Dublin. Stephen White has appeared on several panel discussions representing the blog, including multiple appearances at ''Vinyl &amp; Wine''&lt;ref name="festivalgigguide"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.festivalandgigguide.ie/index.php/blog/gallery/3462-classic-vinyl-sunday-the-velvet-underground-nico-twisted-pepper-sunday-25th-january |title=  CLASSIC VINYL SUNDAY THE VELVET UNDERGROUND &amp; NICO@TWISTED PEPPER SUNDAY 25TH JANUARY | publisher= festivalandgigguide.ie |last= Viansino|first=Elena|accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an appearance at the ''State.ie of the Nation Address''.&lt;ref name="state.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://state.ie/features/getting-heard |title=  Getting Heard…can Irish music reach the masses? | publisher= [[State (magazine)|state.ie]] |last= Phil |first= Udell|accessdate= 2015-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 Stephen appeared as part of a discussion panel at Life Festival, speaking about [[Nas]] and his debut album ''[[Illmatic]]''.&lt;ref name="lifefestival.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.life-festival.com/hunt.php |title=  Hunt &amp; Gather Creations Tent | publisher= life-festival.com | accessdate= 2015-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White also guested as a host on weekly radio show ''the Co-Present'' alongside [[Fight Like Apes]] singer MayKay.

In September 2014 White along with several promoters from the Dublin area ran a charity night for the [[Irish Red Cross]] to raise funds for their appeal to help victims of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]]. The night was headlined by local rock 'n' roll band [[the Minutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/news/The-Minutes-to-headline-upcoming-Gig-for-Gaza/12145046.html|title=The Minutes to headline upcoming Gig for Gaza|publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|date=2014-09-22|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the Last Mixed Tape took part in an event at [[Whelan's (music venue)]] to raise funds for the Yes Equality campaign during the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/Delorentos/news/Whelans-says-YES-set-for-next-Friday/13990876.html|title=Whelan's says YES set for next Friday |publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another charity gig in September 2015 in aid of Irish Red Cross Migration appeal during the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nialler9.com/a-gig-this-friday-for-the-refugee-crisis-featuring-le-galaxie-kormac-buffalo-woman-mother-djs-more/|title= A gig this Friday for the Refugee Crisis featuring Le Galaxie, Kormac, Buffalo Woman, Mother DJ's and more |publisher= Nialler9 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sustainable City''' is a 46 [[hectare]] property development in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Situated on the Al Qudra road, it is the first net zero energy development in the Emirate of Dubai. The development includes 500 villas, 89 apartments and a mixed use area consisting of offices, retail, healthcare facilities, a nursery and food and beverage outlets. Phase 2 of the development will include a hotel, school and innovation centre. 

The City was developed by Dubai-based Diamond Developers, whose Chief Executive Officer, Faris Saeed, has stated that much of his inspiration for the development came from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] West Village.

Key elements of the City include:

* a residential area of 500 townhouses and courtyard villas inspired by Dubai’s old [[Al Bastakiya|Bastakiya]] district
* 11 natural ‘biodome’ greenhouses, organic farm and individual garden farms for local food production that use a passive cooling method with fans and pads.
* 10 MW peak solar production
* waste water recycling, with segregated drainage for [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] using papyrus as a biofilter
* biking and shaded jogging trails
* charging stations for electric cars
* an equestrian centre

Apart from periphery roads and car parking areas, the development is a car-free site.

The parking areas are topped by solar shading featuring solar panels that are connected to an electrical grid to supply energy into different sections of the city.

Panels are also placed on the roofs of all of the houses.

The construction waste is reused to furniture the public spaces.

The townhouses have UV reflective paint to reduce the thermal heat gain inside the houses.

'''''Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution''''' is a treatise by [[Austrian School|Austrian school]] economist and philosopher [[Ludwig von Mises]]. It can be thought of as a continuation in the development of the Misesian system of social science. In particular, it provides further [[epistemology|epistemological]] support for his earlier works, esp. [[Human Action]]. Most notably, Mises elaborates on [[methodological dualism]], develops the concept of [[thymology]] – a historical branch of the sciences of human action – and presents his critique of Marxist [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]].

Furthermore, Mises puts forward a theory of knowledge and value. He later explores and critically analyzes paradigms of thought like [[determinism]], [[materialism]], [[dialectic materialism]], [[historicism]], [[scientism]], [[positivism]], [[behaviorism]] and [[psychology]]. He argues that these schools of thought – some politically motivated,&lt;ref&gt;Mises. (1957). ''Theory and history'', pp. 26, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; others blinded by dogmatism&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 30, 77, 111, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; – have committed epistemological and methodological blunders and are not conducive to a scientific understanding of human behavior.

Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] considered ''Theory and History'' to be Mises's most overlooked work.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. xi-xix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Mises presents the book in four parts.

'''Introduction and Part One – Value:'''

The first part sets the overall theme of the book with Mises introducing the concept of [[methodological dualism]]. He then expounds a theory of value that is central throughout. Regarding his view on science – as systematic body of knowledge, of both natural and social phenomena – as a means to successful action in the world, Mises argues that in order to properly understand human behavior we must attribute – as a methodological resort – [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[Teleology|purpose]] to human behaviour. Mises considers this the epistemological and methodological basis of the sciences of human action. The branch that deals with the logical implications of action as such is called [[praxeology]].

'''Part Two – Determinism and Materialism:'''

In the second part, Mises weighs in on the [[free will]] vs. [[determinism]] controversy and comments that the long historical debates did little to settle the problems at hand. He argues that while the natural sciences, in discovering scientific laws, must presuppose a strict regularity in the occurrence of causes and effects, i.e. determinism, such a presupposition cannot be held in the case of human action. He argues further that the social sciences must take [[thought]]s, [[idea]]s, and [[value judgment|judgments of value]] as ultimately given in the analysis of human action. Our ignorance of the origins and causes of these phenomena, Mises argues, forces us – at least for the time being – to adopt a dualistic approach. He contends that attempts to find the origins and causes of these phenomena are vain, as is the task of all varieties of materialism.&lt;ref&gt;''id''. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Mises then turns his attention to the doctrine of materialism, more specifically, that of Marxist dialectical materialism.

'''Part Three – Epistemological Problems of History:'''

The third part deals with the logical and epistemological problems of historical analysis. Mises explains the individualistic character of historical human events. He argues that the historian must ultimately face – when tracing back the causal factors behind past human action – a point at which no further reduction is possible, i.e. the ideas and actions of individuals. This, he claims, is the "ultimate given of history".&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 183–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the individuality of historical events, Mises still insists there are general laws of human behaviour but that they are praxeological laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], not historical laws, i.e. [[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]. However, [[historicism]], according to Mises, claimed there were no general laws – especially economic laws – of human behavior. Mises then enters into a critique of historicism.

Mises also addresses the challenges of scientism in the context of social science, namely the application of positivism and behaviorism in the realm of human action. However, more noteworthy is Mises's presentation of [[thymology]], a historical branch of the sciences of human action. Mises argues that thymology is what everybody resorts to when trying to [[Verstehen|''understand'']] and anticipate the historical and future actions of their fellow men, and is particularly useful to the historian. He then expounds the scope of thymology and its relation to praxeology.

'''Part Four – The Course of History:'''

In the final part of his treatise, Mises dissects and critiques various speculations and interpretations of history, including a common interpretation of modern [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He also comments on his observation regarding society's move away from [[classical liberalism]], freedom, and capitalism towards socialism and totalitarianism. Moreover, Mises notes the rising ideology of wealth and income equality and speculates on its origins. He argues that rising anti-capitalistic ideology is fostering a present trend toward the impoverishment of society. He criticizes the notion of society's inevitable "trend toward progress",&lt;ref&gt;''id''. pp. 367-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that the evolution of society and civilization is predicated – not on an automatic and inevitable path – but on the underlying ideology which can, at any time, change. To this point, Mises closes with some remarks on the uncertainty of the future and the neglect of ideological factors that can give rise to civilization but also stamp it out.

'''Tin-glazing''' is the process of giving [[ceramic]] items a tin-based [[ceramic glaze|glaze]] that is white, glossy and opaque, which is normally applied to red or buff [[earthenware]]. The opacity and whiteness of tin glaze encourage its frequent decoration with [[overglaze]] colour.  [[Majolica]], [[delftware]] and [[faience]] are among the terms used for common types of [[tin-glazed pottery]].  An alternative is [[Lead-glazed earthenware|lead-glazing]], where the basic glaze is transparent; some types of pottery use both.&lt;ref&gt;For example polychrome [[Delftware]]; Savage, 160&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] is valued in glazes as both an [[opacifier]] and as a white colorant.&lt;ref&gt;’The Glazer’s Book’ – 2nd edition. ''A.B.Searle.The Technical Press Limited.'' London. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Tin oxide has long been used to produce a white, opaque and glossy glaze.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ Third edition. C.W.Parmelee &amp; C.G.Harman.

==History==
{{Main|Tin-glazed pottery}}
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|350px|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] (750-1258 AD)/[[Mesopotamia]] in the 8th century, fragments having been excavated during the First World War from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'', London, Faber and Faber, 1973 {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From Mesopotamia, tin glazes spread to Islamic Egypt (868–905 AD) during the 10th century, and then to Andalusian Spain (711-1492 AD), leading to the maximum development of Islamic [[lusterware]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgia, I., B. Brunettu, A. Sgamellontti, F. Shokouhi, P. Oliaiy, J. Rahighi, M. Lamehi-rachti, M. Mellini, and C. Viti. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of tin glazes in the Islamic world is disputed. One possible reason for the earlier production of tin-glazed wares could be attributed to the trade between the [[Abbasid Empire]] and ancient China from the 8th to 9th century onwards, resulting in imitation of white Chinese [[stoneware]] by local Islamic potters.&lt;ref&gt;Kleimann, B. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Another might be local glaze-making rather than foreign influence, supported by the similarility between the chemical and microstructural features of pre-Islamic white opaque glazes and that on the first tin-opacified wares&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;
[[File:Dutch delft tile topsham.JPG|thumb|Dutch [[delftware]] tin-glazed tile]]

From the Middle East, tin-glaze spread through the Islamic world to [[Hispano-Moresque ware|Spain]]. In the 13th century, tin glazes reached [[Italy]], where the earliest recorded reference to their use is in the 1330s,&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc''. Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the emergence of Italian [[Maiolica]]. Amongst others, [[Luca della Robbia]], born in Florence about 1400, used tin oxide as an opacifier in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. Pelican Books. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Potters began to draw polychrome paintings on the white opaque surface with metallic oxides such as cobalt oxide and to produce [[lustreware]]. The off-white fired body of [[Delftware]] and English [[Majolica]] was made to appear white, and hence mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain, by the application of a glaze opacified and coloured white by the addition of tin oxide.&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery And Ceramics.’ E.Rosenthal. ''Pelican Books''. Harmondsworth. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’Pottery’ C.J.Noke &amp; H.J.Plant. Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd. London. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use and alternatives===
Tin oxide has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology.'' J. R. Taylor &amp; A. C. Bull. The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, additions of up to 6% are reported to be in then-current use.&lt;ref&gt;’Sanitaryware’. D.Fortuna. ''Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a''. Florence. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1914-1918 war, and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press''. Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective their low price led to a gradual increase in popularity with an associated reduction in use of tin oxide. Today, tin oxide usage in glazes finds limited use in conjunction with zircon compounds, although it is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"&gt;‘Ceramic Glazes.’ F.Singer &amp; W.L.German. ''Borax Consolidated Limited''. London. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more ''clinical'' than that from tin oxide, and is consequently preferred in some applications.&lt;ref&gt;'Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers.' K.Shaw. ''A.H.&amp; A.W.Reed.'' Wellington. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Koninklijke Tichelaar Makkum factory, or Royal Tichelaar Makkum, based in [[Makkum, Wûnseradiel|Makkum]], [[Friesland]] continue the production [[Delftware]] using tin-glazed [[earthenware]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klei/Glas/Keram''. 13, No.4, 1992. Pg.103-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tichelaar.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The nature of tin glaze==
[[File:SnO2powder.jpg|thumb|[[Tin dioxide]], the raw ingredient in Tin-glazing.]]
For glaze use only one tin compound, tin (IV) oxide [[Tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and also called stannic acid,&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. ''Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son''. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; is commercially exploited. Opacity is produced in glazes by the addition of some substance to scatter and reflect some of the incident light. 

The opacity of glaze could be determined by the particles which spread through the glaze, therefore the light is absorbed by the particles, being scattered back before reaching the ceramic body, leading to the opaque glaze. As a result, the concentration of the absorbing or scattering particles in the glaze could determine the degree of opacification. Generally speaking, the more different the [[refractive index]] between the particles and the glaze matrix, the larger the opacity. Similarly, the closer the particle size to the light wavelength (100-1000&amp;nbsp;nm for [[visible light]]) and the more irregular the surface, the larger the degree of opacification.

[[tin dioxide|Tin oxide]] remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the glaze. The degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;’A Treatise On Ceramic Industries.’ E.Bourry. Fourth edition. Scott, Greenwood &amp; son. London. 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. Its solubility is increased by Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced by CaO, BaO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a limited extent PbO.&lt;ref name="C.W.Parmelee 1973"/&gt;

Some research on medieval tin glaze has shown that the particle size of tin oxide which appears as cassiterite is around several hundred nanometer, which corresponds to the range of wavelength of visible light.&lt;ref name=Molera1999&gt;Molera, J., Pradell T., Salvadó, N. and Vendrell-Saz, M. "Evidence of Tin Oxide Recrystallization in Opacified Lead Glazes", ''Journal of American Ceramic Society'', 1999, 82:2871-2875&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the tin oxide is presented not only as small crystals but also as aggregates of particles. These factors – the high refractive index, the low solubility in glazes and the particle size make tin oxide an excellent opacifier.    

In the beginning of the use of tin oxide, it is mainly viewed as a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] layer between the glaze and ceramic body. This could be seen from the [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] photomicrographs of some earlier Islamic glazed ceramics, of which the particles of tin oxide are concentrated at the interface, together with the existence of [[wollastonite]], [[diopside]] and air bubble as other opacifiers.&lt;ref name=Manson&gt;Manson, R. B., and M. S. Tite, "The beginnings of tin-opacification of pottery glazes", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 39:41-58, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The microanalysis of later tin glazes reveals the distribution of tin oxide through the glazes rather than just at the interface, which indicates that tin oxide is really acting as an [[opacifier]] instead of only a surface coating layer.&lt;ref name=Manson/&gt;

Lead is usually brought into the glazes with tin oxide. The reaction between lead and tin oxide results in the [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallisation]] of tin oxide,&lt;ref name=Molera1999/&gt; and thus enhances the degree of opacification in tin-opacified glazes than in tin-opacified glass. A high PbO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is often found in ancient glazes. During the firing process, [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] reacts with quartz at approximately 550℃ to form PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which then reacts with tin oxide to produce lead-tin oxide (PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at a temperature higher than 600℃. After the formation of lead-tin oxide, the melting of PbSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PbO and PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurs at the temperature in the range of 700℃ to 750℃, resulting in the dissolution of PbSnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The degree of the crystallisation of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases with the increasing of temperature. During either heating or cooling, the recrystallisation is taken place until the supply of tin is exhausted. In the second heating, lead in the form of lead oxide no longer reacts with tin oxide to form lead silicate, thus the recrystallised [[cassiterite]] (SnO2) remain undissolved and precipitate in the glazes. The [[nucleation]] and [[Crystal growth|growth]] rates of the precipitation depend upon temperature and time. The particle size of the cassiterite developed is also dependent on the temperature, and smaller than that used in the very beginning. It is the smaller particle size of the recrystallised SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in glazes that increases the opacity in tin-opacified glazes. Besides the increasing the opacity, the high lead oxide to tin oxide ratio also reduces the melting point of glazes, lead to a lower firing temperature during production.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., T. Pradell, and A. Shortland. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The technology of tin-glazing==

===Analyses and recipes===
The earliest [[Middle East]]ern tin glazes used [[calcium]], [[lead]] and [[sodium]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]]  as fluxes in combination with the [[silica]] in silica. An Islamic opaque white glaze has been analysed, and is quoted below as a Seger formula:&lt;ref&gt;al-Saad, Z. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  
::*PbO=0.32
::*CaO=0.32
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*MgO=0.04
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.03
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.73
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.07

In this recipe, the addition of [[alkali]] helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the glaze as well. With the development of tin glazes, the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from [[Iran|Persia]] in the 14th century: a glass-[[frit]] of [[quartz]] and [[potash]], a lead-tin [[calx]] and a [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] and quartz.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, J. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, with the spread of tin glazes, lead gradually became the principal background in tin glazes, though a small proportion of alkali was still introduced in order to increase the [[fusibility]]. No specific recipes alluding to tin glazes in [[Spain]] have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white glazes in Spain were lead-silica glazes with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline glazes or lead-alkaline glazes have been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Molera, J., M. Vendrell-Saz, and J. Pérez-Arantegui. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Piccolpasso recorded several glazes used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash glazes.  It is believed early Spanish glazes were similar.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

A Seger analysis of a tin glaze from the early 20th century is:&lt;ref&gt;'A Text-Book On Ceramic Calculations.' W.Jackson. ''Longhmans, Green And Co.'' London. 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*PbO=0.52
::*CaO=0.16
::*K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.03
::*Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=0.29
::*Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0.15
::*SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=2.77
::*SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.23

A more recent recipe is:&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;
::*[[Lead]] bisilicate [[frit]]: 74%
::*[[China clay]]: 10%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Whiting]]: 2%
::*[[Flint]]: 4%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 10%
And another is:&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt;
::*Potassium [[feldspar]]: 65%
::*[[Calcium carbonate|Limestone]]: 11%
::*[[Silica]]: 11%
::*[[Zinc oxide]]: 9%
::*[[Tin oxide]]: 4%

===As a glaze colorant===
In combination with chromium compounds addition of 0.5 - 1.5% tin oxide to a glaze result in a pink colour, with such glazes being known as Chrome-tin pinks.&lt;ref&gt;‘An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.’ P.Rado. ''The Institute Of Ceramics''. Oxford. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Ceramics Glaze Technology.’ J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with small additions of zinc oxide and titanium oxide, additions of tin oxide up to 18% to lead glazes can produce a satin or vellum surface finish.&lt;ref name="Ceramic Glazes 1960"/&gt; The firing temperatures of such glazes are low, in the region of 950 – 1000 ℃ because of the variable degrees of solution of the individual oxides.&lt;ref name="Ceramics Glaze Technology 1986"/&gt; The amount of tin oxide used for coloured glazes depends upon the opacifying property of the chosen chromophore and the intensity of the colour desired; if a deep colour is required less opacifier will be needed than for pastel shades.&lt;ref&gt;’Ceramic Glazes’ C.W.Parmelee. ''Industrial Publications, Inc.'' Chicago. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacture===

Though the recipe of tin glazes may differ in different sites and periods, the process of the production of tin glazes is similar. Generally speaking, the first step of the production of tin glazes is to mix tin and lead in order to form oxides, which was then added to a glaze matrix (alkali-silicate glaze, for example) and heated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, S. R. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; After the mixture cooled, the tin oxide crystallises as what has been mentioned above, therefore generates the so-called white tin-opacified glazes. Besides, the body of tin-opacified wares is generally [[List of vineyard soil types|calcareous clays]] containing 15-25% CaO, of which the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is close to that of tin glazes, thus avoid [[crazing]] during the firing process.&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravaglioli, A., A. Keajewski, M. S. Tite, R. R. Burn, P. A. Simpson, and G. C. Bojani. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the calcareous clay fired in an oxidising atmosphere results in a buff colour, thus lower the concentration of tin oxide used &lt;ref&gt;Tite, M. S., Freestone, I. and Manson, R.B., "Lead glazes in antiquity - methods of production and reasons for use", ''archaeometry'', 1998, 40:241-260&lt;/ref&gt;

The white opaque surface makes tin glaze a good base for painted decoration. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly [[cobalt oxide]] for blue, [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]] for green, [[iron oxide]] for brown, [[manganese dioxide]] for purple-brown and [[antimony]] for yellow.  Late Italian [[maiolica]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called ''istoriato''. To these oxides modern potters are able to add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes [[frit]]ted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pottersconnection.co.uk/shop/33/index.htm Potters Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were not strong enough to penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.&lt;ref name=CaigerSmith73/&gt;

The pottery vessels are biscuit fired, usually between 900 ℃ and 1000 ℃. The fired vessel is dipped in a liquid glaze [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] which sticks to it, leaving a smooth and absorbent surface when dry. On this surface colours are applied by brush, the colours made from powered oxides mixed with water to a consistency of water-colour paint, sometimes with the addition of a binding agent such as [[gum arabic]].  The unfired glaze absorbs the pigment like [[fresco]], making errors difficult to correct but preserving the brilliant colors of the oxides when fired.  The glazed and decorated vessels are returned to the kiln for a second firing, usually between 1000 and 1120 ℃ (the higher temperatures used by modern potters). Lustered wares have a third firing at a lower temperature, necessitating a delicate control of the amount of oxygen in the kiln atmosphere and therefore a flame-burning kiln.

Traditional kilns were wood firing, which required the pots to be protected in the glaze and luster firings by [[saggar]]s or to be fired in a [[muffle]] kiln. Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use electric kilns.

The recrystallisation of tin oxide during the firing provides evidence of the slightly different methods of different production sites, as the crystal size, the distribution and the concentration may be influenced. For instance, the analysis of the 14th century Islamic tin glazes from eastern Spain indicates that these samples may be produced by non-fritting methods, as the heterogeneous distribution of tin oxides may be the remains of original grains of tin oxides.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

The interaction between glaze and body also give clues to different handling and firing processes. As mentioned above, tin glaze suspension is applied to [[biscuit (pottery)|bisque or biscuit]] body made of calcareous clay with high content of [[calcium oxide]]. This could be inferred from the absence of trapped glaze bubbles. If it is applied to an unfired body, the [[calcium carbonate]] will decompose, generating [[carbon dioxide]], the releasing of which from the body to the glaze results in trapped bubbles in the glaze layers.

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He's part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory [[Edward Leigh]] and Labour's [[Gerald Kaufman]] – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh. "It's a unique opportunity for students to hold me to account."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; Teesside Free Education Campaign activists, writing on the website of the [[National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts]], mentioned the union cancelling the film: "A few weeks after the student elections, a planned screening of the film Tory Boy, made by the 2010 Tory candidate for Middlesbrough about his experience standing in the area was cancelled, despite having been screened at schools and colleges up and down the country without controversy." &lt;ref&gt;Teesside Free Education activists [http://anticuts.com/2015/09/21/our-year-with-the-worst-union-in-the-country/ Our year with the ‘worst union in the country’] ''Anticuts.com'' September 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Crowd]] featured an interview with John Walsh website where they showed the actual print work that was created by the Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://mmj.tees.ac.uk//~project22/index5d95.html?p=863&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-releases==
The film received a re-release in cinemas in 2015 in the lead up to the [[2015 UK General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/entertainment/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election|title=Satirical film ToryBoy The Movie returns to big screen|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11807584.BAFTA_nominated_Greenwich_filmmaker_s_controversial_ToryBoy_returns_to_cinemas_before_election/|title=BAFTA-nominated Greenwich filmmaker's controversial ToryBoy returns to cinemas before election|work=News Shopper}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Community cinema screenings were given and included a Q&amp;A from Walsh. &lt;ref&gt;http://hithergreencinema.com/2014/05/a-little-bit-of-politics-tory-boy-the-movie-plus-director-john-walsh-and-qa-with-your-local-candidates/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The film used older film ques from films across the last six decades to create a unique soundscape. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described it as "a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations and music from films like ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie/|title=Toryboy the Movie – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other notable films which provided musical material included: ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' and ''[[The Ladykillers]]''.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

[[File:LatinamericaWasteWaterNorm.png|thumb|right|Requirements of wastewater sewer discharge in Latin America|350px]]

'''Wastewater discharge standards''' protect [[Water supply|water sources]] from [[Water pollution|pollution]] and mismanagement. Each country in [[Latin America]] has its own set of standards, and these vary according to types of water use, agricultural, industrial or recreational use. [[Water quality]] is maintained by controlling the [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriological parameters]]. The majority of water laws include fines for noncompliance. In many cases fines are inadequate and do not stop offending. In some cases the standards are lax and monitoring inadequate.

In this paper is presented a summary of the majority of [[wastewater]] discharge standards in Latin America, complemented with a country ranking considering the quantity and severity of their regulations. Also, a comparative analysis of relevant standards is made, and a real case description for each country when the regulation was not accomplished.

==Chile==

In this country, the [[Ministry of Public Works (Chile)|Ministry of Publics Works]] developed the standard, the decrete number 609,&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Chilean Ministry of Public Works, NORMA DE EMISION PARA LA REGULACION DE CONTAMINANTES ASOCIADOS A LAS DESCARGAS DE RESIDUOS INDUSTRIALES LIQUIDOS A SISTEMAS DE ALCANTARILLADO,1998&lt;/ref&gt; approved on May 7, 1998. This norm was created with the aim to control the effluents discharged into the [[Sewerage|sewer system]]. This norm establishes the maximum discharge concentration in sewer systems and also the different parameters that will be monitored, depending on the economic activity developed by each industry. It also establishes the methods that must be used for taking samples of each parameter.
The control of the norm is responsibility of the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, being the regulator of sanitary services companies the main responsible. If a company produces disruption in the service, in terms of quality or quantity of the recollection, the companies of recollection of wastewater could suspend the service to that company.

'''Case description'''

In May 2009 Aguas Andinas, controlled by the Spanish Enterprise [[Grupo Agbar|Agbar]], will pay a fine because of a lawsuit presented against it by a group of neighbours because of the foul smells coming from the "La Farfana", a [[Water treatment|waste water treatment plant]]. This is one of the waste water recycling plants of Aguas Andinas. This bad odours caused [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] problems. The organization announced that it will appeal this judgement, based on the argument that it was due to a couple of precise episodes beyond its control that did not cause any environmental or personal harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ediciones Financieras S.A. |url=http://df.cl/portal2/content/df/ediciones/20090505/cont_111663.html |title=Aguas Andinas deberá pagar multa por US$4 millones a vecinos |publisher=Diario Financiero Online |date=May 5, 2009 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, the Sanitary Services Superintedent's Office (SISS) started a lawsuit against the paper company Licancel after “not complying with the 90 Supreme Decrete, that regulates waste water disposals”.
As the Superintedent's Office said, this decision is based on the investigation been forwarded that confirmed that this organization discharged its waste water without complying with the norm. As legislation establishes this office can propose and apply the corresponding sanctions, such as fines between one and a thousand Annual Tributary Units (UTA). This means  around 392 Million Pesos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070613/pags/20070613213522.html |title=Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios comenzó proceso de sanción contra Celco |publisher=La Nación |date=June 14, 2007 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==

The norm for discharge, is under the law 1333, approved on April 27, 1992. This law is the general law of environment, and for the specific case was created a regulation for water pollution.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;CONGRESO NACIONAL DE BOLIVIA, LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE,REGLAMENTACIÓN DE LA LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE REGLAMENTO EN MATERIA DE CONTAMINACIÓN HÍDRICA, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulation is applied to every entity that produces a contamination on the water. In the case of the discharge over sewer systems the regulation is under the Chapter IV. It's stated that every company must agree with the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, the limits of discharge. The limits presented in this article, are those for new companies and for companies in process of identification of the type of body water that the company will discharge.

'''Case description'''

In August 2003, all the mining producers working in the city of [[Potosí]] must discharge their waste waters to a specific dike; otherwise they will be obliged to stop their operations. This statement, made by the director of Environment and Sustainable development, Limbert Paredes, who pointed out that this agreement was taken between the Mining Engineers Association of Potosí, law representatives and authorities of the Potosí County.
These companies installed in the upper side of the city must build a pipeline to discharge their waste water by the end of June 2003, which was not done. Because of this, a new meeting was held and a new deadline was given; August 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A.

In February 2009. The neighbors of the “Mercado Walter Khon” have demand attention from local authorities because streets were flooded with waste water coming out from the sewers. Because of this social pressure, the city council made the maintenance and cleaning of the sewers close by the area where waters arose.
Besides some maintenance facts that helped in the flooding, the city council does not restore the S-2 pumping station. Therefore, the wastewater is not properly pumped into the treatment plant.
According to the city's responsible, Marcelo Vidal, because of the constant rain added to garbage and plastic bags, the sewer system is not working properly. Even though he pointed that the main problem's origin is in the pumping station, the situation has not been solved up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A.

==Peru==

In [[Peru]], the norm has only few parameters with limits.&lt;ref name=PE1&gt;Superintendencia de Agua Potable de Lima, REGLAMENTO DE DESAGÜES INDUSTRIALES DECRETO LEY N° 28-60-SAPL,1960&lt;/ref&gt; These parameters are: temperature (35&amp;nbsp;°C), fats and oil (100&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), PH (5 – 8.5), BOD (1000&amp;nbsp;mg/lt) and settleable solids.&lt;ref name=PE1 /&gt; However a more comprehensive norm was developed by the ministry of housing, which now is under review and analysis of the [[Ministry of Environment (Peru)|environment ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivienda.gob.pe/ambiente/OMA1.html |title=Oficina del Medio Ambiente |publisher=Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento, Peru |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present article, the values presented are the ones under approval.&lt;ref name=PE2&gt;Ministry of Housing, APRUEBAN LÍMITES MÁXIMOS PERMISIBLES(LMP) A LAS DESCARGAS DE AGUAS RESIDUALES EN LOS SISTEMAS DE RECOLECCIÓN DE ALCANTARILLADO SANITARIO&lt;/ref&gt; This new regulation was developed because of the damage that industrial wastewater is causing to the sewer system. For example, in year 2006 a study showed that 58% of the sample (24 companies) surpassed the limit of BOD5 established in the current norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt; In the same year other study showed that 57% of the sample (9 companies) surpassed the same norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt;

'''Case description'''

On 2010, water quality is one of the main problems of this country. Only 25% of the domestic water is treated, and the rest of it is thrown into rivers and lakes. This is why a series of measures have been addressed by government. In April 2010, the “National Authority of Water”  will implement different laboratories in order to determine the pollution degree of wastewater from industries. Penalties of up to 36 million Soles have been announced for companies that not treat their residual waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radio.rpp.com.pe/cuidaelagua/habra-multas-para-empresas-que-no-trate-sus-aguas-residuales/ |title=Habrá multas para empresas que no trate sus aguas residuales &amp;#124; Cuida el agua |publisher=GrupoRPP |date=March 26, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==

In the case of this country, the parameters presented correspond to the [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]]. The regulation of the parameters is under the decree N°18.328 of June 8, 1997.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;DO LANÇAMENTO DE EFLUENTES LÍQUIDOS NA REDE COLETORA DE ESGOTOS – DEC 18.328 DE 18.06.97, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the norm is established the maximum limit for industrial effluents in the federal district. Also it's stated the fines applied in the case the companies surpass the norm. Also the decree indicates the type of industry and the types of parameters, that each of them must control.

==Ecuador==

The norm that regulates the limits of discharge in [[Ecuador]], is under the general law of environmental management,&lt;ref name=EC&gt;Congreso Nacional, CODIFICACIÓN 2004-019, LEY DE GESTIÓN AMBIENTAL&lt;/ref&gt; and was created with the aim of regulate the discharge over sewer systems, criteria of water quality for several uses and the procedures for measuring the parameters on the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio del Medio Ambiente de Ecuador, Libro VI de la Calidad Ambiental, NORMA DE CALIDAD AMBIENTAL Y DE DESCARGA DE EFLUENTES : RECURSO AGUA&lt;/ref&gt; Also the norm establishes that companies must keep a record of the generated effluents with the main operational data related to the effluents.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt;

'''Case description'''

In December 2009, the Environment Ministry fined on November 25, five companies of [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]] and [[Montecristi, Ecuador|Montecristi]] with US$43,600 after the failure to execute the environmental policy. These companies: SEAFMAN C.A., Treatment plant IROTOP S.A., LA FABRIL S.A., EUROFISH S.A., Y GONDI S.A. have to pay immediately. The results of laboratory samples proved that levels of different substances were over the limits that were established in the Environment Quality and Waste Water Regulations. An action plan has been implemented to avoid the surpass of the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.codeso.com/PrensaEcuador/091201-El-Ciudadano-Ministerio-Ambiente-multa-industrias-contaminar.html |title=Ministerio del Ambiente multó a cinco industrias por contaminar |publisher=El Ciudadano Ecuador |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, in "Manglares" of "El Salvado", the fauna and flora which are extremely variate, are being affected by households and companies, because of loads coming from thermal power plants. Such discharges generate high temperatures (more than 35℃) that exceed the accepted and established limits, and in consequence the ecosystem is suffering irreversible damages.
Companies like "Categ" and "Electroguayas" have been forced to pay US$1000 fine, but this has not stopped this situation. Other company called "Interagua" has announced a new project that considers water treatment system for this area. The same is planned for Puerto Azul and the rest of the nearby cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planamanecer.com/portada/Actualidad%20%7C%20Noticias/content/modo/view/id/85/Itemid/7 |title=La reserva Manglares de El Salado está en peligro |publisher=Planamanecer.com |date=December 18, 2007 |first=Marialuz |last=Albuja |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==

The national law that regulates water resource in Argentina is the Decree 674 of 1989,&lt;ref name=AR&gt;National Decree 674 of 1989. Decreto reglamentario de la Ley 13.577 de Obras Sanitarias de la Nación. http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/dec674_89.htm&lt;/ref&gt; established by the National Executive Power and applies to the Federal Capital and all the parties of [[Buenos Aires Province]] that are subscribed to the National Sanitary Works Entity regime. The aim of the law is to protect national water resources in means of good water usage, water pollution and the good functioning of the National Sanitary Works Entity installations.
As well, it's applied the Resolution 79179 of 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Disposición 79179/90. Disposiciones instrumentales para la aplicación del Decreto Nº674/89.http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/disp79179_90.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the instrumental arrangements for the Decree 674 implementation. This Resolution includes wastewater discharging parameters to sewer system, water course and rainwater collectors, which are included in Annex A of it.

'''Case Description'''

In June 2006, in Argentina the concentration of different natural heavy materials, bacteries, nitrates and hydrocarbons exceed by much the figures considered dangerous. It is not by chance that rivers like the Paraná, [[Salado del Norte]], [[Salado del Sur River|Salado del Sur]], [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]], [[De La Plata River|de la Plata]] and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] are among the most polluted of the earth. Argentina does not have control means for [[wastewater treatment]] or disposal. There is information that relates about important and numerous water bodies being affected by wastewater disposal, with intense [[eutrophication]] processes due to the lack of treatment.

One out of four hospital beds is occupied by someone with a water related illness. In some inner areas of the country, like [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], water bodies are so polluted that the work in the water treatment plants has been affected. There are some projects to build treatment plants in the main locations, but discharges keeps growing.
Disposals from companies added to the domestic ones in the Riachuelo-Matanza sum up to 368,000 cubic meters per day, which is the double of the minimum average flow of the river. The mud in it has great concentrations of Chrome, Copper, Mercury, Zinc, and Lead. In addition, the highest concentrations of Lead and Chrome are located in the border between the councils of [[Avellaneda]] and [[Lanús]], in the Buenos Aires province.
The given treatments are not sufficient by any means, moreover, the treatments done by companies to their waste water are between deficient and non existing. Most of the water consumed by population comes from the same water bodies in which waste and domestic water is dumped, and because of the lack of treatment these populations ends up drinking water of doubtful quality or at a high purification cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/69816 |title=Contaminación, Arsénico y posibles soluciones... |language=Spanish |publisher=EcoPortal |date=June 8, 2007 |first=Cristian |last=Frers |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, a report generated by the Nation's General Audit (AGN) states that the plants that produce water drinkable are also polluting with elements contained in their waste water, which are over the national and provincial legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=806648 |title=Contaminan el río las plantas que potabilizan agua |publisher=La Nacion |date=May 17, 2006 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

Mexican Law of National Waters regulates water exploitation, use, distribution, control, and the preservation of water quantity and quality.&lt;ref&gt;CONGRESO DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS. 1992. Ley de Aguas Nacionales.http://www.cddhcu.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To manage the wastewater disposal and control water sources quality, it was created in 1996 by the Environmental, Natural Resources and Fishing Secretarial, the official norm NOM-002-ECOL that establishes the maximum permissible limits of pollutants in wastewater discharges in urban sewer system.  The norm specifies the permissible concentrations of pollutants per day, per month and instantaneous sampling, which are included in Chapter 4 of this norm.&lt;ref name=MX&gt;Secretaría de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca. 1996.Norma official mexicana NOM-002-ECOL-1996. http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/gacetas/216/cca31.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Case Description'''

In January 2010, members of the Ducks Unlimited Association of Mexico warned of the death of more than 5,000 migratory birds. The specialist from the association assured that the main cause of this episode was the non treated waste waters from industries. He pointed out the real problem of pollution existing in the "De Silva" dam, and in some others dams in the state. He demanded intervention of the National Water Commission (Conagua) and from SEMARNAR, in order to regulate the discharge of waste water that ends up in the Turbio river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionero.org/ecologia/mueren-mas-de-cinco-mil-aves-en-presa-de-silva/?searchterm=None |title=Mueren más de 5 mil aves en presa De Silva |language=Spanish |publisher=Bionero |date=January 12, 2010 |author=Gaby Bárcenas; Martín Diego |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Municipal Commission of Water and Sewer System of Altamira (COMAPA) was fined by the National Water Commission, between 40 and 50 thousand pesos, for not having a water treatment plant as stated by law for all municipalities of the state of Tataulipas. The next stage would be built a pumping station in "La Pedrera" and the facility must be finished this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laprensa.mx/notas.asp?id=10865 |title=Comisión Nacional del Agua multa a COMAPA por no tener una planta tratadora de aguas |publisher=La Prensa |date=April 23, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==

The main regulator norm for water management is the Decree 1594 of 1984,&lt;ref name=CO&gt;Decree 1594 of 1984.Water usages and wastewater disposal.http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=18617&lt;/ref&gt; which normalizes water usages and wastewater disposal through all the national territory.  The decree establishes water quality standards, which are guides to be used as a basis for decision making in assignation of water uses and determination of water characteristics for each application. Water discharging parameters to public sewage are described in Chapter VI of this decree.
Also, it was considered the Resolution 3957 of 2009&lt;ref name=CO2&gt;Environmental District Department. Resolution 3957 of 2009.Technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.http://www.secretariadeambiente.gov.co/sda/libreria/pdf/Resolucion_3957.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to enlarge the water parameters comparison in this country. This resolution establishes the technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.

'''Case Description'''

A report published by the [[National University of Colombia|National University]] confirms the presence of Lead, Cadmium, Mercury and Arsenic in plants watered with the polluted water of the [[Bogotá River|Bogotá river]]. According to it, vegetables have high levels of heavy metals that can be dangerous for human health.
For the Regional Autonomous Corporation (CAR) this is due to industrial downloads. In general, levels found in water, soil and vegetables of this area are much higher than the limits allowed by the [[World Health Organization]]. The authors, Soacha y Mosquera show figures much higher than the European Union limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/cundinamarca/hortalizas-regadas-con-aguas-del-rio-bogota-contienen-metales-perjudiciales-para-la-salud_6309887-1 |title=Hortalizas regadas con aguas del río Bogotá contienen metales perjudiciales para la salud |publisher=El Tiempo |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the industrial firm "Coca-Cola Femsa" was fined with 111,000 US$ due to its illegal discharge of industrial water in Bogotá, as informed by the District Environmental of the Capital District of Columbia. A technical report conducted by the Aqueduct and Sewer system of Bogotá proved the existence of some waste water disposal that does not go through the company's treatment plant.

The former Administrative Environmental Department (Dama) has given to the company an allowance for having a downloading point in October 2006, but the Aqueduct and Sewer system of [[Bogotá]] found that place has already four discharge points, none of them registered or authorized.  Since January 2008, those four points were closed down and conducted to a treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtv.gov.ve/noticias-ciencia-y-salud/11164 |title=Colombia: Coca Cola deberá pagar multa millonaria por contaminación |publisher=Venezolana de Televisión |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==

The Environmental Organic Law of [[Venezuela]] gives the guidelines in terms of water management, as a duty of the state for the protection of watersheds. This in terms of classification and control of the quality of water bodies, control of effluent discharges or fluids susceptible of degrading the aquatic environment and alters the levels of quality required to preserve and improve the environment. The Decree 883 follows these guidelines, being Venezuela's national norm for water classification and control, created in 1995.

The Decree regulates the quality of water bodies and wastewater discharges. This law establishes the different types of water and the permissible parameters for water discharges in accordance to the final water use.  Wastewater discharging parameters to public sewer system are contained in section V of Decree 883.&lt;ref name=VE&gt;Decreto No. 883  de 1995.

==Comparison Analysis==
For purposes of having an idea of the requirements of the regulation, an index was created with the aim to rank the countries. This concept assumes that if a country has tighten limits than other, or if it declares explicitly a limit, then the regulation could be considered more stringent.

This index takes in account all the parameters listed in the table, assuming the following criteria. If a country doesn't have any regulation, then it will get 1, from a scale of 10. If the country has the minimum limit it will get 10 points, if it has the maximum then it will get 5 points. Later, an average is taken from all the parameters of the country, giving the index a relative position of all the countries. Afterwards, all the values are classified using quartiles.
A summary with the values of each country is presented below.

===pH===
The pH is a chemical parameter that measures the acidity or basicity of the water and is commonly measured in situ. Distilled water has a pH of 7,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-research.net/ph]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where less than 7 is considered acid and greater than 7 is considered basic. In most cases, low pH is due to organic overloading and low oxygen conditions in the water. This characteristic is strictly controlled because it has a direct effect on water ecosystems and sewer systems materials.

Usually, pH standard is between 6 and 9 and can vary easily depending on the discharge content.   In this case, Peru was the country with the smallest range (6–8) and Argentina and Mexico were the ones with the widest range (5.5–10). No limit was found for Canada Regulation.

===Settleable Solids===
A low concentration of suspended solids in water or even complete removal after treatment is crucial to maintain water ecosystems development. High concentrations of suspended solids can slow down photosynthesis, reduce dissolved oxygen and increase water temperature.

That is why suspended solids is a relevant parameter in wastewater discharge, that can be attribute to both industrial and domestic wastewater. When comparing wastewater regulations, was found that Bolivia has the strictest limit for this parameter (60&amp;nbsp;mg/L) while Colombia presented the highest limit (600&amp;nbsp;mg/L). The value presented for Colombia was extracted from the technical norm for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district. Within these two limit values is shown a big difference among the two countries regulations for these standard, whereas for Canada was encountered an average value of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;===
The BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; standard is also an indicator of solid's presence in water, but specifically for organic matter. BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;represents the amount of oxygen required by microorganism to stabilize organic material present in wastewater. A higher concentration of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; means a high load of organic matter to be stabilized by microorganism.

Therefore, Chile has the stricter regulation for BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; permitting wastewater discharges with a value between 33 and 55&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Also, Chile was the only country that presented a range for the limit of this parameter. By the other hand, Colombia has the higher limit with 800&amp;nbsp;mg/L. In this case, is also taken the value from the Capital District Regulation, because there wasn’t a specific value presented in the national norm, just said that BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; removal must be greater than 80% for a new user. In comparison with Canada and the other countries, Chile's limit is a very strict value.

===Arsenic===
Arsenic is considered as a substance of sanitary interest and at the same time is one of the most toxic elements that exist. Arsenic can be found naturally in the environment and also be an essential trace element for some animals. Due to human activities, mainly through mining and melting, Arsenic can now be found on many more places than where they existed naturally.
World production of arsenic, in the form of its oxide, is around 50.000 ton per year. Chile and Mexico are primary exporters of Arsenic. Also, it is mainly emitted by the copper producing industries, but also during lead and zinc production and in agriculture. Arsenic can’t be destroyed once it has entered the environment, which causes severe health effects on humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/water/arsenic/arsenic-and-water.htm#ixzz0mflYN2Bk |title=Arsenic (As) and water : Arsenic and water: reaction mechanisms, environmental impact and health effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned before, Chile and Mexico are primary producers of Arsenic and when checking Arsenic limit values in their regulations aren’t the more severe ones.  Mexico and Brazil are the countries with a higher limit value and Ecuador stays with the lower limit. As Arsenic is also linked with agriculture, it is important to emphasize that the majority of the Latin-American countries are characterized by having an agricultural economy. As a result, limit values encountered for Arsenic in all the Regulations varies from a small range of 0,1 to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cadmium===
Cadmium is also considered as a substance of sanitary interest. Although, it can be found naturally in the environment and it always occurs in combination with zinc. In industry is a by-product of zinc, lead and copper extraction. Also is found in many manures and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/as.htm#ixzz0mfjFkotg |title=Arsenic (As) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cadmium can easily end up in soils and transported to surface waters when using manures and pesticides.  Actually, regulations for Cadmium are strict, so little Cadmium enters the water through disposal of wastewater.

The main producing country is of zinc is Canada, with Mexico and Peru also being ones of the major suppliers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;CIA. The world Factbook. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In the regulations comparison, Cadmium standard was more severe in Ecuador with an acceptance of 0,02&amp;nbsp;mg/L, whilst Brazil was the laxer one with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L. For the case of Canada, Mexico and Peru, the latter has the stricter limit among them with 0,2&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while the other two remain in the average with 0,7&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cyanide===
Cyanide, a substance of sanitary concern, is only due to use and discharge of the industrial sector. Cyanide has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following cyanide exposure depends in part on the form of cyanide, such as hydrogen cyanide gas or cyanide salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html#bookmark03&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide has been a major component of metal-plating solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php |title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide |publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Latino-American regulations, Argentina is the country that presents the harshner limit value with 0,1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. By the contrary, Mexico was the one with the higher limit value with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L.
Among the Latin-American countries, Colombia is the only one that is mentioned as having gold mining industry.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The limit value for Cyanide is quite high (1&amp;nbsp;mg/L) to the limit value of Argentina. However, three more other countries have the same limit value for Cyanide.

===Hexavalent chromium===
This is a toxic component, that could cause allergic reactions on the skin and also several problems in the respiratory system.&lt;ref name =CR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/cr.htm |title=Chromium (Cr) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a component present in the industries of chemicals, leather, textile, electro painting among others.&lt;ref name=CR /&gt;

The minimum requirement for this element is presented in Bolivia (0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), and the maximum is presented in Mexico(0.75&amp;nbsp;mg/lt). Despite Brazil being one of the main producers of chromium, it doesn't have a maximum limit as do other countries.

Since the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|founding of the State of Israel]], relatively few women have served in the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]], and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman—[[Golda Meir]]—has served as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.

{{As of|2018}}, women comprise 28% of Israel's 120-member [[Knesset]]. For comparison (as of 2004), the female ratio in the Arab world is 6.4%, in [[European Union]] average is 17.6% and in [[Scandinavia]] 40% "and rising".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/women2004.html Women In Israel] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States of America, women comprise only 19.3% of the House of Representatives. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from Arab or religious Jewish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Women_in_public_life.html Women in Public Life] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/MKIndex_Current_eng.asp?view=3 Current Female Knesset Members] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Golda Meir]] is the only woman to serve as the [[Prime Minister of Israel]]. She was chosen for the job just before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]] following the death of [[Levi Eshkol]], and ended her job in 1974. She and [[Tzipi Livni]] are the only women who served as [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Affairs Ministers]], Meir having served in the job for 10 years—from 1956 to 1966. Livni is the only woman to serve in the second most important job in the Israeli government, [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Vice Prime Minister|Vice Prime Minister]].

Once Golda Meir resigned in 1974, it was another 12 years until another woman was appointed as a minister with a portfolio, when [[Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino]] was appointed [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Minister]], and 18 years until a woman was appointed to any other portfolio, [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]].

After Golda Meir, the leading jobs which women held are as follows: [[Education Minister of Israel|Education Minister]] for a total of 9 years (5 of them by [[Limor Livnat]], 3 years by [[Yuli Tamir]] and 1 year by [[Shulamit Aloni]]), and [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Communications]], also for a total of 7 years (6 years by [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Limor Livnat]], and 1 year by [[Dalia Itzik]]). [[Tzipi Livni]] was acting [[Justice Minister of Israel|Minister of Justice]] for a month, and then Minister of Justice for almost a year and a half. [[Ayelet Shaked]] was appointed as Minister of Justice in 2015.

Although a few women did succeed in reaching the leading posts in the Israeli government, a number of them hadn't ever been held by women, such as [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]], [[Internal Security Minister of Israel|Internal Security Minister]], [[Finance Ministry (Israel)|Finance Minister]].

== Historical overview ==
===Until the 1970s===
[[Image:Golda Meir2.jpg|thumb|[[Golda Meir]], at a meeting in the [[White House]], 1973]]
From the first Israeli government until the 12th, [[Golda Meir]] was the only woman in the Israeli government (though not the parliament). Golda Meir, who started out as a secretary of the Women's Labour Council of Histadrut, and later became the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]'s political department, and then an ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], came back to Israel in 1949 after she was elected to the [[Knesset]], and served as the Israeli Minister of Labor. She held this job for 7 years under a number of Prime Ministers, until in 1956 she became Foreign Minister, a job she held for 10 years until 1966.

After 3 years, in which she wasn't a member of the Israeli government, she was chosen as the head the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment party]] and as Prime Minister, and she was voted as Prime Minister again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]], when the party got the highest number of seats in the Knesset. Despite being a woman, she wasn't known as a [[Feminism|Feminist]], and she didn't appoint any other women to positions in the government.

During Golda Meir's time, the number of woman members of Knesset was around 10–14 on average (out of 120), mostly from [[Mapai]] and its successor parties. In the elections during which Golda Meir was to become prime minister, only 8 women got into the Knesset.

=== The 1970s ===

The portrayal of '''[[Warrior|women warriors]]''' in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a [[counter stereotype]], opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine.&lt;ref name="Stringer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringer|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=Radner|editor1-first=Hilary|editor2-last=Stringer|editor2-first=Rebecca|title=Feminism at the Movies|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=From Victim to Vigilante: Gender, Violence, and Revenge in ''The Brave One'' (2007) and ''Hard Candy'' (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}} This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and [[gender roles]] in society.

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:Medieval women as warriors.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval women helping to defend the city from attack.]]
{{See also|List of women warriors in folklore}}
In Hindu mythology, [[Chitrāngadā]], wife of [[Arjuna]], was the commander of her father's armies.

The [[Amazons]] were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. "Amazon" has become an [[eponym]] for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.

In British mythology, [[Queen Cordelia]] fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is Queen [[Boudica]], who lead a rebellion against the [[Roman Empire]].

In his ''On the Bravery of Women'' the Greco-Roman historian [[Plutarch]] describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of [[Telesilla]] in the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/A.html|title=Plutarch • On the Bravery of Women — Sections I‑XV|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Plant, I.M.|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806136219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC|page=33|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, film, and television==
{{See also|List of female action heroes and villains}}
Literary women warriors include "[[Gordafarid]]" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem [[The Shāhnāmeh]], [[Delhemma]] in [[Arabic epic literature]], [[Mulan]], [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Belphoebe]] and [[Britomartis|Britomart]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Bradamante]] and [[Marfisa]] in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Clorinda (Jerusalem Delivered)|Clorinda]] and (reluctantly) Erminia in ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]'', and [[Grendel's mother]].

The woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.&lt;ref name="Heinecken"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the Female Body in Popular Media|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|last1=Dawn|first1=Heinecken}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasker|first1=Yvonne|title=Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==In feminism==
Women warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood.&lt;ref name="Stringer" /&gt;{{rp|269}}  Professor Sherrie Inness in ''Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/945.html Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in ''Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2003-catalog/athenas-daughters.html Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors]''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, focus on figures such as [[Xena]], from the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' or [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and [[Girl Power|girl power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 Book review]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Violence===
Although there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like ''[[Kill Bill]]'' still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression.&lt;ref name=Lavin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavin|first1=Maud|title=Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women|date=2010|publisher=MIT|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108,237}} Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=Verstraten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verstraten|first1=Katelyn|title=For Indigenous Women, Radical Art as a Last Resort|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2013/06/22/Radical-Art/|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=The Tyee|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]''.&lt;ref name=Stringer /&gt;{{rp|269}}
