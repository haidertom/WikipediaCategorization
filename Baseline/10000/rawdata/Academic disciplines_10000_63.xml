'''Aerobic granular reactor''' is a type of waste treatment facility.

==Overview==
[[Sewage treatment]] plants (STP) based on [[activated sludge]] often cover large surface areas, necessitated mainly by the large [[settling tank]]s. To build compact STP’s, [[biomass]] can be grown as [[biofilms]] on a carrier material, or as fast settling [[Aerobic granulation|aerobic granular sludge]] without a carrier.  Recent research showed the advantages of a discontinuously fed system, in which it is possible to grow stable granulated sludge under aerobic conditions.

Simultaneous [[Chemical oxygen demand]], and [[Nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus]] removal, can be easily integrated in a discontinuous fed system.  Because of the high settling capacity of the granules, the use of a traditional settler is unnecessary.  Therefore the installation can be built very compact, needing only 20% of the surface area of conventional activated sludge systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5871">The '''Bird–Meertens formalism''' ('''BMF''') is a [[calculation|calculus]] for [[program derivation|deriving programs]] from [[program specification|specification]]s (in a [[functional programming|functional-programming]] setting) by a process of equational reasoning. It was devised by [[Richard Bird (computer scientist)|Richard Bird]] and [[Lambert Meertens]] as part of their work within [[IFIP Working Group 2.1]].

It is sometimes referred to in publications as BMF, as a nod to [[Backus–Naur form]]. Facetiously it is also referred to as ''Squiggol'', as a nod to [[ALGOL]], which was also in the remit of WG 2.1, and because of the "squiggly" symbols it uses. A less-used variant name, but actually the first one suggested, is ''SQUIGOL''.

== Basic examples and notations ==

[[Map (higher-order function)|Map]] is a well-known second-order function that applies a given function to every element of a list; in BMF, it is written &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f*[e_1,\dots,e_n] =  [f\ e_1,\dots,f\ e_n].&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, [[Fold (higher-order function)|reduce]] is a function that collapses a list into a single value by [[Iterated binary operation|repeated application of a binary operator]]. It is written / in BMF.
Taking &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; as a suitable binary operator with neutral element ''e'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\oplus / [e_1,\dots,e_n] =  e \oplus e_1 \oplus \dots \oplus e_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Using those two operators and the primitives &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; (as the usual addition), and &lt;math&gt;+\!\!\!+&lt;/math&gt; (for list concatenation), we can easily express the sum of all elements of a list, and the [[flatten (higher-order function)|flatten]] function, as &lt;math&gt;{\rm sum} = + /&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\rm flatten} = +\!\!\!+ /&lt;/math&gt;, in
[[currying|currified notation]]. We have:

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm sum}\ [e_1,\dots,e_n] = + / [e_1,\dots,e_n] =  0 +  e_1 + \dots+ e_n = \sum_k e_k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm flatten}\  [l_1,\dots,l_n] =+\!\!\!+ / [l_1,\dots,l_n] =  [\,] +\!\!\!+\;  l_1 +\!\!\!+ \dots+\!\!\!+\; l_n = \text{ the concatenation of all lists } l_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, writing &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; for [[functional composition]] and &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; for [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], it is easy to write a function testing that all elements of a list satisfy a predicate ''p'', simply as &lt;math&gt;{\rm all}\ p = (\land /)\cdot(p*)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\rm all}\ p\ [e_1,\dots,e_n] 
&amp;= (\land /)\cdot(p*)\ [e_1,\dots,e_n] 
\\&amp;= \land /(p* [e_1,\dots,e_n])
\\&amp;= \land /[p\ e_1,\dots,p\ e_n]
\\&amp;= p\ e_1\land \dots \land p\ e_n
\\&amp;= \forall k\ . \ p\ e_k.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The homomorphism lemma and its applications to parallel implementations ==

A function ''h'' on lists is a list [[homomorphism]] if there exists an associative binary operator &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and neutral element  &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;h\ [\,] &amp;&amp;=\ e \\
&amp;h\ (l +\!\!\!+\; m) &amp;&amp;=\ h\ l \oplus h\ m. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The ''homomorphism lemma'' states that ''h'' is a homomorphism if and only if there exists an operator &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and a function ''f'' such that &lt;math&gt;h = (\oplus/)\cdot(f*)&lt;/math&gt;.

A point of great interest for this lemma is its application to the derivation of highly [[parallel computing|parallel]] implementations of computations. Indeed, it is trivial to see that &lt;math&gt;f*&lt;/math&gt; has a highly parallel implementation, and so does &lt;math&gt;\oplus/&lt;/math&gt; — most obviously as a binary tree. Thus for any list homomorphism ''h'', there exists a parallel implementation. That implementation cuts the list into chunks, which are assigned to different computers; each computes the result on its own chunk. It is those results that transit on the network and are finally combined into one. In any application where the list is enormous and the result is a very simple type – say an integer – the benefits of parallelisation are considerable. This is the basis of the [[map-reduce]] approach.

[[File:A-SET Mind Controlled Wheelchair.jpg|thumb|Diwakar Vaish, an inventor of a brain-controlled wheelchair, during a press ceremony.]]

A '''brain–computer interface''' ('''BCI'''), sometimes called a '''neural-control interface''' ('''NCI'''), '''mind-machine interface''' ('''MMI'''), '''direct neural interface''' ('''DNI'''), or '''brain–machine interface''' ('''BMI'''), is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired [[brain]] and an external device. BCI differs from [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]] in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.&lt;ref name="Krucoff 584"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krucoff|first=Max O.|last2=Rahimpour|first2=Shervin|last3=Slutzky|first3=Marc W.|last4=Edgerton|first4=V.

Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]], followed by a contract from [[DARPA]].&lt;ref name="Vidal1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4583653|doi=10.1146/annurev.bb.02.060173.001105|year=1973|last1=Vidal|first1=JJ|title=Toward direct brain-computer communication|volume=2|pages=157–80|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics and Bioengineering|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

The field of BCI research and development has since focused primarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing, sight and movement. Thanks to the remarkable [[neuroplasticity|cortical plasticity]] of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10896180|year=2000|last1=Levine|first1=SP|last2=Huggins|first2=JE|last3=Bement|first3=SL|last4=Kushwaha|first4=RK|last5=Schuh|first5=LA|last6=Rohde|first6=MM|last7=Passaro|first7=EA|last8=Ross|first8=DA|last9=Elisevich|first9=KV|last10=Smith|first10=B.

Following years of animal experimentation, the first [[neuroprosthetic]] devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid-1990s.

==History==
The history of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) starts with [[Hans Berger]]'s discovery of the electrical activity of the human brain and the development of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG. Berger was able to identify [[neural oscillation|oscillatory activity]], such as Berger's wave or the [[alpha wave]] (8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz), by analyzing EEG traces.

Berger's first recording device was very rudimentary. He inserted [[silver]] wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils attached to the patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a [[Lippmann electrometer|Lippmann capillary electrometer]], with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the [[Siemens]] double-coil recording [[galvanometer]], which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.

Berger analyzed the interrelation of alternations in his EEG wave diagrams with [[Central nervous system disease|brain diseases]]. EEGs permitted completely new possibilities for the research of human brain activities.

Although the term had not yet been coined, one of the earliest examples of a working brain-machine interface was the piece ''Music for Solo Performer'' (1965) by the American composer [[Alvin Lucier]]. The piece makes use of EEG and analog signal processing hardware (filters, amplifiers, and a mixing board) to stimulate acoustic percussion instruments. To perform the piece one must produce [[alpha waves]] and thereby "play" the various percussion instruments via loudspeakers which are placed near or directly on the instruments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Volker Straebel |author2 = Wilm Thoben |title = Alvin Lucier's music for solo performer: experimental music beyond sonification |url= |journal = Organised Sound |volume = 19 |issue =1 |year = 2014 |pages = 17–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UCLA]] Professor Jacques Vidal coined the term "BCI" and produced the first peer-reviewed publications on this topic.&lt;ref name="Vidal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2"/&gt; Vidal is widely recognized as the inventor of BCIs in the BCI community, as reflected in  numerous peer-reviewed articles reviewing and discussing the field (e.g.,&lt;ref name="Wolpaw, J.R 2012"&gt;Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw, E.W. (2012). "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Something New Under the Sun". In: ''Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice'', Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw (eds.), E.W. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wolpaw J.R. |author2=Birbaumer N. |author3=McFarland D.J. |author4=Pfurtscheller G. |author5=Vaughan T. M. | year = 2002 | title = Brain–computer interfaces for communication and control | url = | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 113 | issue = 6| pages = 767–791 | doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(02)00057-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allison B.Z. |author2=Wolpaw E.W. |author3=Wolpaw J.R. | year = 2007 | title = Brain computer interface systems: Progress and prospects | journal = British Review of Medical Devices | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 463–474 | doi=10.1586/17434440.4.4.463|pmid=17605682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). His 1973 paper stated the "BCI challenge": Control of objects using EEG signals. Especially he pointed out to [[Contingent negative variation|Contingent Negative Variation (CNV)]] potential as a challenge for BCI control. The 1977 experiment Vidal described was the first application of BCI after his 1973 BCI challenge. It was a noninvasive EEG (actually Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)) control of a cursor-like graphical object on a computer screen. The demonstration was movement in a maze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~vidal/Real_Time_Detection.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his early contributions, Vidal was not active in BCI research, nor BCI events such as conferences, for many years. In 2011, however, he gave a lecture in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], supported by the Future BNCI project, presenting the first BCI, which earned a standing ovation. Vidal was joined by his wife, Laryce Vidal, who previously worked with him at UCLA on his first BCI project.

In 1988 report was given on noninvasive EEG control of a physical object, a robot. The experiment described was EEG control of multiple start-stop-restart of the robot movement, along an arbitrary trajectory defined by a line drawn on a floor. The line-following behavior was the default robot behavior, utilizing autonomous intelligence and autonomous source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski, M. Sestakov, L. Bozinovska: Using EEG alpha rhythm to control a mobile robot, In G. Harris, C. Walker (eds.) ''Proc. IEEE Annual Conference of Medical and Biological Society'', p. 1515-1516, New Orleans, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski: Mobile robot trajectory control: From fixed rails to direct bioelectric control, In O. Kaynak (ed.) ''Proc. IEEE Workshop on Intelligent Motion Control'', p. 63-67, Istanbul, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 report was given on a  bidirectional adaptive BCI controlling computer buzzer by an anticipatory brain potential, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential.&lt;ref&gt;L. Bozinovska, G. Stojanov, M. Sestakov, S. Bozinovski: CNV pattern recognition: step toward a cognitive wave observation, In L. Torres, E. Masgrau, E. Lagunas (eds.) Signal Processing V: Theories and Applications, Proc. EUSIPCO-90: Fifth European Signal Processing Conference, Elsevier, p. 1659-1662, Barcelona, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Bozinovska, S. Bozinovski, G. Stojanov, Electroexpectogram: experimental design and algorithms, In Proc IEEE International Biomedical Engineering Days, p. 55-60, Istanbul, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The experiment described how an expectation state of the brain, manifested by CNV, controls in a feedback loop the S2 buzzer in the S1-S2-CNV paradigm. The obtained cognitive wave representing the expectation learning in the brain is named Electroexpectogram (EXG). The CNV brain potential was part of the BCI challenge presented by Vidal in his 1973 paper.

In 2015, the BCI Society] was officially launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcisociety.org/|title=BCI Society Homepage|website=BCI society|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-profit organization is managed by an international board of BCI experts from different sectors (academia, industry, and medicine) with experience in different types of BCIs, such as invasive/non-invasive and control/non-control. The board is elected by the members of the Society, which has several hundred members. Among other responsibilities, the BCI Society organizes international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-meeting-2016-past-meetings|title=BCI Meetings Past Meetings|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Neuroprosthetics is an area of [[neuroscience]] concerned with neural prostheses, that is, using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain related problems, or of sensory organs. The most widely used neuroprosthetic device is the [[cochlear implant]] which, as of December 2010, had been implanted in approximately 220,000 people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/coch.aspx|title= Cochlear Implants|author= NIH Publication No. 11-4798|date= 1 March 2011|publisher= [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision, including [[retinal implant]]s.

The difference between BCIs and neuroprosthetics is mostly in how the terms are used: neuroprosthetics typically connect the nervous system to a device, whereas BCIs usually connect the brain (or nervous system) with a computer system. Practical neuroprosthetics can be linked to any part of the nervous system—for example, peripheral nerves—while the term "BCI" usually designates a narrower class of systems which interface with the central nervous system.

The terms are sometimes, however, used interchangeably. Neuroprosthetics and BCIs seek to achieve the same aims, such as restoring sight, hearing, movement, ability to communicate, and even [[cognitive function]].&lt;ref name="Krucoff 584"/&gt; Both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques.

==Animal BCI research==

Several laboratories have managed to record signals from monkey and rat [[cerebral cortex|cerebral cortices]] to operate BCIs to produce movement. Monkeys have navigated [[Cursor (computers)|computer cursors]] on screen and commanded robotic arms to perform simple tasks simply by thinking about the task and seeing the visual feedback, but without any motor output.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Nicolelis ''et al.'' (2001) [http://www.dukemedicine.org/AboutUs/Facts_and_Statistics/historical_highlights/index/view Duke neurobiologist has developed system that allows monkeys to control robot arms via brain signals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060005/http://www.dukemedicine.org/AboutUs/Facts_and_Statistics/historical_highlights/index/view |date=19 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 photographs that showed a monkey at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] operating a robotic arm by thinking were published in a number of well-known science journals and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Baum| first = Michele| title = Monkey Uses Brain Power to Feed Itself With Robotic Arm| publisher = Pitt Chronicle| date = 6 September 2008| url = http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1478| accessdate = 6 July 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090910034547/http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1478| archivedate = 10 September 2009| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===
[[File:Monkey using a robotic arm.jpg|thumb|Monkey operating a robotic arm with brain–computer interfacing (Schwartz lab, University of Pittsburgh)]]
In 1969 the [[operant conditioning]] studies of Fetz and colleagues,
at the Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, [[University of Washington School of Medicine]] in [[Seattle]], showed for the first time that monkeys could learn to control the deflection of a [[biofeedback]] meter arm with neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.163.3870.955|title=Operant Conditioning of Cortical Unit Activity|year=1969|last1=Fetz|first1=E. E.|journal=Science|volume=163|pmid=4974291|issue=3870|bibcode = 1969Sci...163..955F|pages=955–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar work in the 1970s established that monkeys could quickly learn to voluntarily control the firing rates of individual and multiple neurons in the primary [[motor cortex]] if they were rewarded for generating appropriate patterns of neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0014-4886(78)90252-2|pmid=101388|year=1978|last1=Schmidt|first1=EM|last2=McIntosh|first2=JS|last3=Durelli|first3=L|last4=Bak|first4=MJ|title=Fine control of operantly conditioned firing patterns of cortical neurons|volume=61|issue=2|pages=349–69|journal=Experimental Neurology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that developed [[algorithms]] to reconstruct movements from [[motor cortex]] [[neurons]], which control movement, date back to the 1970s. In the 1980s, Apostolos Georgopoulos at [[Johns Hopkins University]] found a mathematical relationship between the electrical responses of single motor cortex neurons in [[rhesus macaque|rhesus macaque monkeys]] and the direction in which they moved their arms (based on a [[cosine]] function). He also found that dispersed groups of neurons, in different areas of the monkey's brains, collectively controlled motor commands, but was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time, because of the technical limitations imposed by his equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.2911737|title=Mental rotation of the neuronal population vector|year=1989|last1=Georgopoulos|first1=A.|last2=Lurito|first2=J.|last3=Petrides|first3=M|last4=Schwartz|first4=A.|last5=Massey|first5=J.|journal=Science|volume=243|pmid=2911737|issue=4888|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..234G|pages=234–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been rapid development in BCIs since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16859758 |url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/mmpi/papers/Lebedev%202006.pdf |year=2006 |last1=Lebedev |first1=MA |last2=Nicolelis |first2=MA |title=Brain-machine interfaces: past, present and future |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=536–46 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2006.07.004 |journal=Trends in Neurosciences }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several groups have been able to capture complex brain motor cortex signals by recording from [[neural ensemble]]s (groups of neurons) and using these to control external devices.

===Prominent research successes===

====Kennedy and Yang Dan====
Phillip Kennedy (who later founded [http://www.neuralsignals.com/ Neural Signals] in 1987) and colleagues built the first intracortical brain–computer interface by implanting neurotrophic-cone [[electrodes]] into monkeys.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg|thumb|Yang Dan and colleagues' recordings of cat vision using a BCI implanted in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (top row: original image; bottom row: recording)]] &lt;!-- FAIR USE of LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg for rationale --&gt; In 1999, researchers led by Yang Dan at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images seen by cats. The team used an array of electrodes embedded in the [[thalamus]] (which integrates all of the brain’s sensory input) of sharp-eyed cats. Researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] area, which decodes signals from the [[retina]]. The cats were shown eight short movies, and their neuron firings were recorded. Using mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to generate movies of what the cats saw and were able to reconstruct recognizable scenes and moving objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stanley.bme.gatech.edu/publications/stanley_dan_1999.pdf|pmid=10479703|year=1999|last1=Stanley|first1=GB|last2=Li|first2=FF|last3=Dan|first3=Y|title=Reconstruction of natural scenes from ensemble responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus|volume=19|issue=18|pages=8036–42|journal=Journal of Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results in humans have since been achieved by researchers in [[Japan]] ([[#MEG and MRI|see below]]).

====Nicolelis====
[[Miguel Nicolelis]], a professor at [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]], has been a prominent proponent of using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals to drive a BCI.

After conducting initial studies in rats during the 1990s, Nicolelis and his colleagues developed BCIs that decoded brain activity in [[night monkey|owl monkeys]] and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms. Monkeys have advanced reaching and grasping abilities and good hand manipulation skills, making them ideal test subjects for this kind of work.

By 2000 the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a [[joystick]] or reached for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35042582|year=2000|last1=Nicolelis|first1=Miguel A. L.|last2=Wessberg|first2=Johan|last3=Stambaugh|first3=Christopher R.|last4=Kralik|first4=Jerald D.|last5=Beck|first5=Pamela D.|last6=Laubach|first6=Mark|last7=Chapin|first7=John K.|last8=Kim|first8=Jung|last9=Biggs|first9=S.

A.|journal=Nature|volume=408|pmid=11099043|title=Real-time prediction of hand trajectory by ensembles of cortical neurons in primates|issue=6810|pages=361–5|display-authors=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCI operated in real time and could also control a separate robot remotely over [[Internet protocol]]. But the monkeys could not see the arm moving and did not receive any feedback, a so-called [[open-loop controller|open-loop]] BCI.

[[File:Brain-computer interface (schematic).jpg|thumb|Diagram of the BCI developed by Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues for use on [[rhesus monkeys]]]]

Later experiments by Nicolelis using [[rhesus monkeys]] succeeded in [[feedback loop|closing the feedback loop]] and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys are considered to be better models for human [[neurophysiology]] than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden.&lt;ref name=carmena2003&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14624244|year=2003|last1=Carmena|first1=JM|last2=Lebedev|first2=MA|last3=Crist|first3=RE|last4=O'Doherty|first4=JE|last5=Santucci|first5=DM|last6=Dimitrov|first6=DF|last7=Patil|first7=PG|last8=Henriquez|first8=CS|last9=Nicolelis|first9=MA|title=Learning to control a brain-machine interface for reaching and grasping by primates|volume=1|issue=2|pages=E42|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000042|pmc=261882|journal=PLoS Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lebedev2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4088-04.2005|title=Cortical Ensemble Adaptation to Represent Velocity of an Artificial Actuator Controlled by a Brain-Machine Interface|year=2005|last1=Lebedev|first1=M.

The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted [[Grip strength|handgripping force]]. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with [[rhesus monkeys]]. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct [[Cortical stimulation mapping|intracortical stimulation (ICMS)]] in the arm representation area of the [[sensory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Odoherty2003&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21976021 | year=2011 | last1=O’Doherty | first1=JE | last2=Lebedev | first2=MA | last3=Ifft | first3=PJ | last4=Zhuang | first4=KZ | last5=Shokur | first5=S | last6=Bleuler | first6=H | last7=Nicolelis | first7=MA | title=Active tactile exploration using a brain–machine–brain interface | issue=7372 | pages=228–231 | doi=10.1038/nature10489 | pmc=3236080 | journal=Nature  | volume=479|bibcode = 2011Natur.479..228O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Donoghue, Schwartz and Andersen====
Other laboratories which have developed BCIs and algorithms that decode neuron signals include those run by John Donoghue at [[Brown University]], Andrew Schwartz at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and Richard Andersen at [[Caltech]]. These researchers have been able to produce working BCIs, even using recorded signals from far fewer neurons than did Nicolelis (15–30 neurons versus 50–200 neurons).

Donoghue's group reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen (closed-loop BCI) with or without assistance of a joystick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11894084|year=2002|last1=Serruya|first1=MD|last2=Hatsopoulos|first2=NG|last3=Paninski|first3=L|last4=Fellows|first4=MR|last5=Donoghue|first5=JP|title=Instant neural control of a movement signal|volume=416|issue=6877|pages=141–2|doi=10.1038/416141a|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..141S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1070291|title=Direct Cortical Control of 3D Neuroprosthetic Devices|year=2002|last1=Taylor|first1=D.

Andersen's group used recordings of [[premovement neuronal activity|premovement activity]] from the [[posterior parietal cortex]] in their BCI, including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1097938|title=Cognitive Control Signals for Neural Prosthetics|year=2004|last1=Musallam|first1=S.|journal=Science|volume=305|pmid=15247483|last2=Corneil|first2=BD|last3=Greger|first3=B|last4=Scherberger|first4=H|last5=Andersen|first5=RA|issue=5681|bibcode = 2004Sci...305..258M|pages=258–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other research====
In addition to predicting [[kinematic]] and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] parameters of limb movements, BCIs that predict [[Electromyography|electromyographic]] or electrical activity of the muscles of primates are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04320.x|title=Frontal and parietal cortical ensembles predict single-trial muscle activity during reaching movements in primates|year=2005|last1=Santucci|first1=David M.|last2=Kralik|first2=Jerald D.|last3=Lebedev|first3=Mikhail A.|last4=Nicolelis|first4=Miguel A. L.|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=22|pmid=16190906|issue=6|pages=1529–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such BCIs could be used to restore mobility in paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles.

Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues demonstrated that the activity of large neural ensembles can predict arm position. This work made possible creation of BCIs that read arm movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators. Carmena and colleagues&lt;ref name=carmena2003/&gt; programmed the neural coding in a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm. Lebedev and colleagues&lt;ref name=lebedev2005/&gt; argued that brain networks reorganize to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal's own limbs.

The biggest impediment to BCI technology at present is the lack of a sensor modality that provides safe, accurate and robust access to brain signals. It is conceivable or even likely, however, that such a sensor will be developed within the next twenty years. The use of such a sensor should greatly expand the range of communication functions that can be provided using a BCI.

Development and implementation of a BCI system is complex and time consuming. In response to this problem, Gerwin Schalk has been developing a general-purpose system for BCI research, called [[BCI2000]]. BCI2000 has been in development since 2000 in a project led by the Brain–Computer Interface R&amp;D Program at the [[Wadsworth Center]] of the [[New York State Department of Health]] in [[Albany, New York]], United States.

A new 'wireless' approach uses [[light-gated ion channel]]s such as [[Channelrhodopsin]] to control the activity of genetically defined subsets of neurons [[in vivo]]. In the context of a simple learning task, illumination of [[Transfection|transfected]] cells in the somatosensory cortex influenced the decision making process of freely moving [[mice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18094685|year=2008|last1=Huber|first1=D|last2=Petreanu|first2=L|last3=Ghitani|first3=N|last4=Ranade|first4=S|last5=Hromádka|first5=T|last6=Mainen|first6=Z|last7=Svoboda|first7=K|title=Sparse optical microstimulation in barrel cortex drives learned behaviour in freely moving mice|volume=451|issue=7174|pages=61–4|doi=10.1038/nature06445|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2008Natur.451...61H|pmc=3425380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of BMIs has also led to a deeper understanding of neural networks and the central nervous system. Research has shown that despite the inclination of neuroscientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs. The use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble. Other principles discovered with the use of BMIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nicolelis Miguel A. L |author2=Lebedev Mikhail A | year = 2009 | title = Principles of Neural Ensemble Physiology Underlying the Operation of Brain-Machine Interfaces | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 530–540 | doi=10.1038/nrn2653 | pmid=19543222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCIs are also proposed to be applied by users without disabilities. A [[User-centered design|user-centered]] categorization of BCI approaches by Thorsten O. Zander and Christian Kothe introduces the term passive BCI.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zander|first=Thorsten O|last2=Kothe|first2=Christian|title=Towards passive brain–computer interfaces: applying brain–computer interface technology to human–machine systems in general|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/8/2/025005|pmid=21436512|page=025005|year=2011|bibcode=2011JNEng...8b5005Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to active and reactive BCI that are used for directed control, passive BCIs allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during Human-Computer Interaction ([[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]]). In a secondary, implicit control loop the computer system adapts to its user improving its [[usability]] in general.

==Human BCI research==

===Invasive BCIs===

====Vision====
[[File:BCI JensNaumann.png|thumb|Jens Naumann, a man with acquired blindness, being interviewed about his vision BCI on CBS's [[The Early Show]]]]

Invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality for people with paralysis. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the [[grey matter]] of the brain during neurosurgery. Because they lie in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to [[scar|scar-tissue]] build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Polikov, Vadim S., Patrick A. Tresco, and William M. Reichert |title=Response of brain tissue to chronically implanted neural electrodes |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=148 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=1–18 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027005002931 |doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.08.015|pmid=16198003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[vision science]]'', direct [[brain implant]]s have been used to treat non-[[congenital]] (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher [[William H. Dobelle|William Dobelle]].

Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into "Jerry", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry’s [[visual cortex]] and succeeded in producing [[phosphenes]], the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a [[mainframe computer]], but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html Vision quest], ''Wired Magazine'', September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrainGate.jpg|thumb|Dummy unit illustrating the design of a [[BrainGate]] interface]]

In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle’s second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call "the starry-night effect". Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to [[driving|drive]] an automobile slowly around the parking area of the research institute.&lt;ref name="Naumann, J. 2012"&gt;Naumann, J.

====Movement====
BCIs focusing on ''motor neuroprosthetics'' aim to either restore movement in individuals with paralysis or provide devices to assist them, such as interfaces with computers or robot arms.

Researchers at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]], led by Philip Kennedy and Roy Bakay, were first to install a brain implant in a human that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement. Their patient, Johnny Ray (1944–2002), suffered from ‘[[locked-in syndrome]]’ after suffering a brain-stem [[stroke]] in 1997. Ray’s implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant, eventually learning to control a computer cursor; he died in 2002 of a [[brain aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00001756-199806010-00007|pmid=9665587|year=1998|last1=Kennedy|first1=PR|last2=Bakay|first2=RA|title=Restoration of neural output from a paralyzed patient by a direct brain connection|volume=9|issue=8|pages=1707–11|journal=NeuroReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tetraplegic]] [[Matt Nagle]] became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of [[Cyberkinetics]]’s [[BrainGate]] chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle’s right [[precentral gyrus]] (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Leigh R.

More recently, research teams led by the Braingate group at [[Brown University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11076|bibcode=2012Natur.485..372H|pmc= 3640850|pmid= 22596161| title = Reach and grasp by people with tetraplegia using a neurally controlled robotic arm| journal = Nature| volume = 485| issue = 7398| pages = 372–5| year = 2012| last1 = Hochberg | first1 = L.

===Partially invasive BCIs===
Partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than within the grey matter. They produce better resolution signals than non-invasive BCIs where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar-tissue in the brain than fully invasive BCIs. There has been preclinical demonstration of intracortical BCIs from the stroke perilesional cortex.&lt;ref name="robust neuroprosthetic"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/22/8653.abstract |title=Robust Neuroprosthetic Control from the Stroke Perilesional Cortex |year=2015 |last1=Gulati |first1=Tanuj |last2=Won |first2=Seok Joon |last3=Ramanathan |first3=Dhakshin S. |last4=Wong |first4=Chelsea C. |last5=Bodepudi |first5=Anitha |last6=Swanson |first6=Raymond A. |last7=Ganguly |first7=Karunesh |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=35 |pages=8653–8661 |pmid=26041930 |issue=22 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5007-14.2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electrocorticography]]'' (ECoG) measures the electrical activity of the brain taken from beneath the skull in a similar way to non-invasive electroencephalography, but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the [[dura mater]].&lt;ref&gt;Serruya MD, Donoghue JP. (2003) Chapter III: Design Principles of a Neuromotor Prosthetic Device in Neuroprosthetics: Theory and Practice, ed. Kenneth W. Horch, Gurpreet S. Dhillon. Imperial College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from [[Washington University]] in [[St Louis]]. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play [[Space Invaders]] using his ECoG implant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-info.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/7800.html Teenager moves video icons just by imagination], press release, Washington University in St Louis, 9 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness.

(Note: these electrodes had not been implanted in the patient with the intention of developing a BCI. The patient had been suffering from severe [[epilepsy]] and the electrodes were temporarily implanted to help his physicians localize seizure foci; the BCI researchers simply took advantage of this.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schalk|first1=G|last2=Miller|first2=KJ|last3=Anderson|first3=NR|last4=Wilson|first4=JA|last5=Smyth|first5=MD|last6=Ojemann|first6=JG|last7=Moran|first7=DW|last8=Wolpaw|first8=JR|last9=Leuthardt|first9=EC|title=Two-dimensional movement control using electrocorticographic signals in humans|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|date=2008|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/5/1/008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signals can be either subdural or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain [[parenchyma]] itself. It has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects. Currently, the only manner to acquire the signal for study is through the use of patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus.

ECoG is a very promising intermediate BCI modality because it has higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp-recorded EEG, and at the same time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and probably superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities.&lt;ref name=Mondeofuse&gt;{{cite news |first= Takafumi|last= Yanagisawa|title=Electrocorticographic Control of Prosthetic Arm in Paralyzed Patients |doi=10.1002/ana.22613 |quote= ECoG- Based BCI has advantage in signal and durability that are absolutely necessary for clinical application|work=[[American Neurological Association]] |year= 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelepathicCommVowel&gt;{{cite news |first= X.|last= Pei|title=Decoding Vowels and Consonants in Spoken and Imagined Words Using Electrocorticographic Signals in Humans |pmid=21750369 |quote= Justin Williams, a biomedical engineer at the university, has already transformed the ECoG implant into a micro device that can be installed with a minimum of fuss.

Light reactive imaging BCI devices are still in the realm of theory. These would involve implanting a [[laser]] inside the skull. The laser would be trained on a single neuron and the neuron's reflectance measured by a separate sensor. When the neuron fires, the laser light pattern and wavelengths it reflects would change slightly. This would allow researchers to monitor single neurons but require less contact with tissue and reduce the risk of scar-tissue build-up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Non-invasive BCIs===
There have also been experiments in humans using [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] [[neuroimaging]] technologies as interfaces. The substantial majority of published BCI work involves noninvasive EEG-based BCIs. Noninvasive EEG-based technologies and interfaces have been used for a much broader variety of applications. Although EEG-based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery, they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher-frequency signals because the skull dampens signals, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. EEG-based interfaces also require some time and effort prior to each usage session, whereas non-EEG-based ones, as well as invasive ones require no prior-usage training. Overall, the best BCI for each user depends on numerous factors.

==== Non-EEG-based human–computer interface ====

=====Pupil-size oscillation=====
In a 2016 article, an entirely new communication device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface was developed, requiring no [[Fixation (visual)|visual fixation]] or ability to move eyes at all, that is based on covert [[interest (emotion)|interest]] in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best fit between, on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0148805|pmid=26848745|title=The Mind-Writing Pupil: A Human-Computer Interface Based on Decoding of Covert Attention through Pupillometry|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0148805|year=2016|last1=Mathôt|first1=Sebastiaan|last2=Melmi|first2=Jean-Baptiste|last3=Van Der Linden|first3=Lotje|last4=Van Der Stigchel|first4=Stefan|pmc=4743834|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1148805M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional near-infrared spectroscopy=====
In 2014 and 2017, a BCI using [[functional near-infrared spectroscopy]] for "locked-in" patients with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) was able to restore some basic ability of the patients to communicate with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallegos-Ayala|first1=G|last2=Furdea|first2=A|last3=Takano|first3=K|last4=Ruf|first4=CA|last5=Flor|first5=H|last6=Birbaumer|first6=N|title=Brain communication in a completely locked-in patient using bedside near-infrared spectroscopy|journal=Neurology|date=27 May 2014|volume=82|issue=21|pages=1930–2|pmid=24789862|doi=10.1212/WNL.0000000000000449|pmc=4049706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RamseyChaudhary2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramsey|first1=Nick F.|last2=Chaudhary|first2=Ujwal|last3=Xia|first3=Bin|last4=Silvoni|first4=Stefano|last5=Cohen|first5=Leonardo G.|last6=Birbaumer|first6=Niels|title=Brain–Computer Interface–Based Communication in the Completely Locked-In State|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=15|issue=1|year=2017|pages=e1002593|issn=1545-7885|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593|pmid=28141803|pmc=5283652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces====

=====Overview=====
[[File:ElectroEncephalogram.png|thumb|Recordings of brainwaves produced by an [[electroencephalogram]]]]

[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) is the most studied non-invasive interface, mainly due to its fine [[temporal resolution]], ease of use, portability and low set-up cost. The technology is somewhat susceptible to [[noise]] however.

In the early days of BCI research, another substantial barrier to using EEG as a brain–computer interface was the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the [[University of Tübingen]] in [[Germany]] trained severely paralysed people to self-regulate the ''slow cortical potentials'' in their EEG to such an extent that these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200307/communicating-brain-waves Just short of telepathy: can you interact with the outside world if you can't even blink an eye?], ''Psychology Today'', May–June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; (Birbaumer had earlier trained [[epilepsy|epileptics]] to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months. However, the slow cortical potential approach to BCIs has not been used in several years, since other approaches require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users.

Another research parameter is the type of [[neural oscillation|oscillatory activity]] that is measured. Birbaumer's later research with Jonathan Wolpaw at [[New York State University]] has focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI, including ''[[Mu wave|mu]]'' and ''[[Beta wave|beta]]'' rhythms.

A further parameter is the method of feedback used and this is shown in studies of [[P300 (Neuroscience)|P300]] signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily ([[Event-related potential|stimulus-feedback]]) when people see something they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the [[biofeedback]] methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected.

While an EEG based brain-computer interface has been pursued extensively by a number of research labs, recent advancements made by [[Bin He]] and his team at the [[University of Minnesota]] suggest the potential of an EEG based brain-computer interface to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interface. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional [[MRI]] and [[EEG]] source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19850134|year=2010|last1=Yuan|first1=H|title=Negative covariation between task-related responses in alpha/beta-band activity and BOLD in human sensorimotor cortex: an EEG and fMRI study of motor imagery and movements|volume=49|issue=3|pages=2596–2606|journal=NeuroImage|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.028|last2=Liu|first2=Tao|last3=Szarkowski|first3=Rebecca|last4=Rios|first4=Cristina|last5=Ashe|first5=James|last6=He|first6=Bin|pmc=2818527}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Refined by a neuroimaging approach and by a training protocol, Bin He and co-workers demonstrated the ability of a non-invasive EEG based brain-computer interface to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in 3-dimensional space, based upon motor imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22046274|year=2011|last1=Doud|first1=AJ|title=Continuous Three-Dimensional Control of a Virtual Helicopter Using a Motor Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interface|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e26322|journal=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026322|editor1-last=Gribble|editor1-first=Paul L|last2=Lucas|first2=John P.|last3=Pisansky|first3=Marc T.|last4=He|first4=Bin|pmc=3202533|bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626322D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 it was announced that Bin He had developed the technique to enable a remote-control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22764978 |title=Thought-guided helicopter takes off |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to a brain-computer interface based on brain waves, as recorded from scalp EEG electrodes, Bin He and co-workers explored a virtual EEG signal-based brain-computer interface by first solving the EEG [[inverse problem]] and then used the resulting virtual EEG for brain-computer interface tasks. Well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis based brain-computer interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15876632|year=2004|last1=Qin|first1=L|title=Motor imagery classification by means of source analysis for brain-computer interface applications|volume=1|issue=3|pages=135–141|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/1/3/002|last2=Ding|first2=Lei|last3=He|first3=Bin|bibcode = 2004JNEng...1..135Q |pmc=1945182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study found that severely motor-impaired patients could communicate faster and more reliably with non-invasive EEG BCI, than with any muscle-based communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höhne|first1=J|last2=Holz|first2=E|last3=Staiger-Sälzer|first3=P|last4=Müller|first4=KR|last5=Kübler|first5=A|last6=Tangermann|first6=M|title=Motor imagery for severely motor-impaired patients: evidence for brain-computer interfacing as superior control solution|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2014|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e104854|pmid=25162231|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0104854|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j4854H|pmc=4146550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dry active electrode arrays====
In the early 1990s Babak Taheri, at [[University of California, Davis]] demonstrated the first single and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(94)90053-1|title=A dry electrode for EEG recording☆|year=1994|last1=Taheri|first1=B|last2=Knight|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=R|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=90|pmid=7514984|issue=5|pages=376–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to [[silver]]/[[silver chloride]] electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by [[impedance matching]]. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.

The electrode was tested on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity, namely: (1) spontaneous EEG, (2) sensory event-related potentials, (3) brain stem potentials, and (4) cognitive event-related potentials. The performance of the dry electrode compared favorably with that of the standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1994PhDT........82A |title=Active Micromachined Scalp Electrode Array for Eeg Signal Recording |author=Alizadeh-Taheri, Babak |journal=PhD Thesis |year=1994|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 researchers at [[Case Western Reserve University]], in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to [[quadriplegic]] Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify patterns in the noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.08/assist_pr.html The Next Brainiacs]''Wired Magazine'', August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SSVEP mobile EEG BCIs ====
In 2009, the NCTU Brain-Computer-Interface-headband was reported. The researchers who developed this BCI-headband also engineered silicon-based [[Microelectromechanical systems|MicroElectro-Mechanical System]] (MEMS) [[Electroencephalography#Dry EEG electrodes|dry electrodes]]  designed for application in non-hairy sites of the body. These electrodes were secured to the [[Data acquisition|DAQ]] board in the headband with snap-on electrode holders. The signal processing module measured [[Alpha wave|alpha]] activity and the Bluetooth enabled phone assessed the patients’ alertness and capacity for cognitive performance. When the subject became drowsy, the phone sent arousing feedback to the operator to rouse them.

In 2013, comparative tests were performed on android cell phone, tablet, and computer based BCIs, analyzing the power [[Spectral density|spectrum density]] of resultant EEG SSVEPs. The stated goals of this study, which involved scientists supported in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, were to “increase the practicability, portability, and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI, for daily use.” Citation It was reported that the stimulation frequency on all mediums was accurate, although the cell phone’s signal demonstrated some instability. The amplitudes of the SSVEPs for the laptop and tablet were also reported to be larger than those of the cell phone. These two qualitative characterizations were suggested as indicators of the feasibility of using a mobile stimulus BCI.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Limitations =====
In 2011, researchers stated that continued work should address ease of use, performance robustness, reducing hardware and software costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the difficulties with EEG readings is the large susceptibility to motion artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Symeonidou|first=Evangelia-Regkina|last2=D Nordin|first2=Andrew|last3=Hairston|first3=W David|last4=Ferris|first4=Daniel|date=2018-04-03|title=Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324211295|journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1073|doi=10.3390/s18041073|pmid=29614020|pmc=5948545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most the previously described research projects, the participants were asked to sit still, reducing head and eye movements as much as possible, and measurements were taken in a laboratory setting. However, since the emphasized application of these initiatives had been in creating a mobile device for daily use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the technology had to be tested in motion.

In 2013, researchers tested mobile EEG-based BCI technology, measuring SSVEPs from participants as they walked on a treadmill at varying speeds. This research was supported by the [[Office of Naval Research]], Army Research Office, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. Stated results were that as speed increased the SSVEP detectability using CCA decreased. As independent component analysis ([[Independent component analysis|ICA]]) had been shown to be efficient in separating EEG signals from noise,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yijun|last2=Wang|first2=Ruiping|last3=Gao|first3=Xiaorong|last4=Hong|first4=Bo|last5=Gao|first5=Shangkai|date=2006-6|title=A practical VEP-based brain-computer interface|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering|volume=14|issue=2|pages=234–239|doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875576|issn=1534-4320|pmid=16792302}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scientists applied ICA to CCA extracted EEG data. They stated that the CCA data with and without ICA processing were similar. Thus, they concluded that CCA independently demonstrated a robustness to motion artifacts that indicates it may be a beneficial algorithm to apply to BCIs used in real world conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Prosthesis and environment control====
Non-invasive BCIs have also been applied to enable brain-control of prosthetic upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of [[Graz University of Technology]] and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled [[functional electrical stimulation]] system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pfurtscheller | first1 = G. | last2 = Müller | first2 = G.

In their [[spinal cord injury research]] study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain-controlled ambulation.&lt;ref name="DoWang2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Do|first1=An H|last2=Wang|first2=Po T|last3=King|first3=Christine E|last4=Chun|first4=Sophia N|last5=Nenadic|first5=Zoran|title=Brain-computer interface controlled robotic gait orthosis|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|volume=10|issue=1|year=2013|page=111|issn=1743-0003|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-10-111|pmid=24321081|pmc=3907014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXNCwonhjG8 Subject with Paraplegia Operates BCI-controlled RoGO (4x)] at YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009 Alex Blainey, an independent researcher based in the UK, successfully used the [[Emotiv]] EPOC to control a 5 axis robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cq35VbRpTY Alex Blainey controls a cheap consumer robot arm using the EPOC headset via a serial relay port] at YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to make several demonstration mind controlled wheelchairs and home automation that could be operated by people with limited or no motor control such as those with paraplegia and cerebral palsy.

Research into military use of BCIs funded by [[DARPA]] has been ongoing since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Vidal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2" /&gt; The current focus of research is user-to-user communication through analysis of neural signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Drummond| first = Katie| title = Pentagon Preps Soldier Telepathy Push| publisher = Wired Magazine|date = 14 May 2009| url =https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/05/pentagon-preps-soldier-telepathy-push| accessdate = 6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DIY and open source BCI====
In 2001, The OpenEEG Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/ |title=The OpenEEG Project |publisher=Openeeg.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated by a group of DIY neuroscientists and engineers. The ModularEEG was the primary device created by the OpenEEG community; it was a 6-channel signal capture board that cost between $200 and $400 to make at home. The OpenEEG Project marked a significant moment in the emergence of DIY brain-computer interfacing.

In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program published a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiernerds.com/brain-hack |title=How To Hack Toy EEGs |publisher=Frontiernerds.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tutorial, which stirred the minds of many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts, demonstrated how to create a single channel at-home EEG with an [[Arduino]] and a Mattel [[Mindflex]] at a very reasonable price. This tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement.

In 2013, OpenBCI emerged from a [[DARPA]] solicitation and subsequent [[Kickstarter]] campaign. They created a high-quality, open-source 8-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the 32bit Board, that retailed for under $500. Two years later they created the first 3D-printed EEG Headset, known as the Ultracortex, as well as a 4-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the Ganglion Board, that retailed for under $100.

In 2015, NeuroTechX was created with the mission of building an international network for neurotechnology.

====MEG and MRI====
{{Main|Magnetoencephalography|Magnetic resonance imaging}}

[[File:Visual stimulus reconstruction using fMRI.png|thumb|ATR Labs' reconstruction of human vision using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] (top row: original image; bottom row: reconstruction from mean of combined readings)]]

[[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) have both been used successfully as non-invasive BCIs.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganatha Sitaram, Andrea Caria, Ralf Veit, Tilman Gaber, Giuseppina Rota, Andrea Kuebler and Niels Birbaumer(2007) "[http://mts.hindawi.com/utils/GetFile.aspx?msid=25487&amp;vnum=2&amp;ftype=manuscript FMRI Brain–Computer Interface: A Tool for Neuroscientific Research and Treatment]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely reported experiment, fMRI allowed two users being scanned to play [[Pong]] in real-time by altering their [[haemodynamic response]] or brain blood flow through [[biofeedback]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news040823-18|title=Mental ping-pong could aid paraplegics|journal=News@nature|year=2004|last1=Peplow|first1=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

fMRI measurements of haemodynamic responses in real time have also been used to control robot arms with a seven-second delay between thought and movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117493/ To operate robot only with brain], ATR and Honda develop BMI base technology, ''Tech-on'', 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 research developed in the Advanced Telecommunications Research (ATR) [[Computational Neuroscience]] Laboratories in [[Kyoto]], Japan, allowed the scientists to reconstruct images directly from the brain and display them on a computer in black and white at a [[Display resolution|resolution]] of 10x10 [[pixels]]. The article announcing these achievements was the [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] of the journal [[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] of 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.11.004|pmid=19081384|title=Visual Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity using a Combination of Multiscale Local Image Decoders|journal=Neuron|volume=60|issue=5|pages=915–29|year=2008|last1=Miyawaki|first1=Yoichi|last2=Uchida|first2=Hajime|last3=Yamashita|first3=Okito|last4=Sato|first4=Masa-aki|last5=Morito|first5=Yusuke|last6=Tanabe|first6=Hiroki C.|last7=Sadato|first7=Norihiro|last8=Kamitani|first8=Yukiyasu}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 researchers from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.031|pmid=21945275|title=Reconstructing Visual Experiences from Brain Activity Evoked by Natural Movies|journal=Current Biology|volume=21|issue=19|pages=1641–1646|year=2011|last1=Nishimoto|first1=Shinji|last2=Vu|first2=An T.|last3=Naselaris|first3=Thomas|last4=Benjamini|first4=Yuval|last5=Yu|first5=Bin|last6=Gallant|first6=Jack L.|pmc=3326357}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This was achieved by creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to look up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random [[YouTube]] videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/09/22/breakthrough-could-enable-others-to-watch-your-dreams-and-memories-video/  | title= Breakthrough Could Enable Others to Watch Your Dreams and Memories  | last = Yam  | first = Philip  | date       = 22 September 2011  | publisher  = Scientific American  | accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://sites.google.com/site/gallantlabucb/publications/nishimoto-et-al-2011  | title      = Reconstructing visual experiences from brain activity evoked by natural movies (Project page)  | publisher  = The Gallant Lab at [[UC Berkeley]]  | accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url= http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/| title= Scientists use brain imaging to reveal the movies in our mind  | author= Yasmin Anwar  | date= 22 September 2011  | publisher  = [[UC Berkeley]] News Center| accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BCI control strategies in neurogaming====

=====Motor imagery=====

[[Motor imagery]] involves the imagination of the movement of various body parts resulting in [[sensorimotor cortex]] activation, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coyle|first1=Damien|last2=Marshall|first2=David|last3=Wilson|first3=Shane|last4=Callaghan|first4=Michael|title=Games, Gameplay, and BCI: The State of the Art|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games|volume=5|issue=2|page = 83|doi=10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2263555 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advance machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery. The top performing algorithm from BCI Competition IV&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; dataset 2 for motor imagery is the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern, developed by Ang et al. from [[A*STAR]], [[Singapore]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ang|first=Kai Keng|last2=Chin|first2=Zheng Yang|last3=Wang|first3=Chuanchu|last4=Guan|first4=Cuntai|last5=Zhang|first5=Haihong|date=1 January 2012|title=Filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm on BCI competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b|journal=Neuroprosthetics|volume=6|page=39|doi=10.3389/fnins.2012.00039|pmc=3314883|pmid=22479236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Bio/neurofeedback for passive BCI designs=====
Biofeedback is used to monitor a subject's mental relaxation. In some cases, biofeedback does not monitor electroencephalography (EEG), but instead bodily parameters such as [[electromyography]] (EMG), [[galvanic skin response|galvanic skin resistance]] (GSR), and [[heart rate variability]] (HRV). Many biofeedback systems are used to treat certain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problems in children, teeth grinding, and chronic pain. EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four different bands (theta: 4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz, alpha:8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz, SMR: 12–15&amp;nbsp;Hz, beta: 15–18&amp;nbsp;Hz) and challenge the subject to control them. Passive BCI&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; involves using BCI to enrich human–machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user's state, for example, simulations to detect when users intend to push brakes during an emergency car stopping procedure. Game developers using passive BCIs need to acknowledge that through repetition of game levels the user's cognitive state will change or adapt. Within the first play
of a level, the user will react to things differently from during the second play: for example, the user will be less surprised at an event in the game if he/she is expecting it.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;

=====Visual evoked potential (VEP)=====

A VEP is an electrical potential recorded after a subject is presented with a type of visual stimuli. There are several types of VEPs.

[[Steady state visually evoked potential|Steady-state visually evoked potential]]s (SSVEPs) use potentials generated by exciting the [[retina]], using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns and at times simply use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP has proved to be successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay.

Another type of VEP used with applications is the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300 potential]]. The P300 event-related potential is a positive peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after the appearance of a target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or [[Oddball paradigm|oddball stimuli]]. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response Using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected "choice letter" was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/application-of-p300-event-related-potential-in-brain-computer-interface|last=Haider|first=Ali|last2=Fazel-Rezai|first2=Reza|date=2017|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/intechopen.69309|title=Event-Related Potentials and Evoked Potentials|isbn=978-953-51-3639-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic telepathy/silent communication===

In 2010 the DARPA's budget for the fiscal year included $4 million to start up a program called Silent Talk. The goal was to "''allow user-to-user communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through analysis of neural signals''". ''The program had three major goals: 1) to attempt to identify electroencephalography patterns unique to individual words, 2) ensure that those patterns are generalizable across users in order to prevent extensive device training, and 3) construct a fieldable pre-prototype that would decode the signal and transmit over a limited range.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/attachments/%282G7%29%20Global%20Nav%20-%20About%20Us%20-%20Budget%20-%20Budget%20Entries%20-%20FY2010%20%28Approved%29.pdf|title=Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Estimates.

In a $6.3 million Army initiative to invent devices for telepathic communication, [[Gerwin Schalk]], underwritten in a $2.2 million grant, found the use of ECoG signals can discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and imagined words, shedding light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants, and could provide the basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech.&lt;ref name="TelepathicCommVowel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TelepathicComm"&gt;{{cite news |first= Pagan|last= Kennedy|title=The Cyborg in Us All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/the-cyborg-in-us-all.html?pagewanted=all |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=18 September 2011  |accessdate=28 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 [[Kevin Warwick]] had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the Internet to investigate enhancement possibilities.

Research into synthetic telepathy using [[subvocalization]] is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura. The first such communication took place in the 1960s using EEG to create Morse code using brain alpha waves. Using EEG to communicate imagined speech is less accurate than the invasive method of placing an electrode between the skull and the brain.&lt;ref name= Telepathy&gt;{{cite news|title= Army Developing‘synthetic telepathy’|url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27162401/#.Uidehm25fIV|accessdate=13 October 2008 |newspaper=Discovery News|date=13 October 2008|author= Bland, Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2013 the group with [[Miguel Nicolelis]] at [[Duke University]] and IINN-ELS successfully connected the brains of two rats with electronic interfaces that allowed them to directly share information, in [[Miguel Nicolelis#Brain to brain|the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface]].&lt;ref name=" srep01319"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pais-Vieira |first=Miguel |last2=Lebedev |first2=Mikhail |last3=Kunicki |first3=Carolina |last4=Wang |first4=Jing |last5=Nicolelis |first5=Miguel A.L. |title=A Brain-to-Brain Interface for Real-Time Sharing of Sensorimotor Information|journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=3 |pages=1319 |date=28 February 2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01319|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1319P |pmid=23448946 |pmc=3584574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One Rat Thinks, and Another Reacts|author=Gorman, James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/science/new-research-suggests-two-rat-brains-can-be-linked.html|work=New York Times|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/28/brains-rats-connected-share-information|title=Brain-to-brain interface lets rats share information via internet|website=The Guardian|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-culture BCIs==
{{Main|Cultured neuronal network}}

Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or [[neurochip]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1051-07.2007|title=Interfacing Neurons with Carbon Nanotubes: Electrical Signal Transfer and Synaptic Stimulation in Cultured Brain Circuits|year=2007|last1=Mazzatenta|first1=A.|last2=Giugliano|first2=M.|last3=Campidelli|first3=S.|last4=Gambazzi|first4=L.|last5=Businaro|first5=L.|last6=Markram|first6=H.|last7=Prato|first7=M.|last8=Ballerini|first8=L.|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=27|pmid=17596441|issue=26|pages=6931–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaltechNeuroChip.jpg|thumb|The world's first [[Neurochip]], developed by [[Caltech]] researchers Jerome Pine and Michael Maher]]

Development of the first working neurochip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome Pine and Michael Maher in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-scientists-devise-first-neurochip-213 Caltech Scientists Devise First Neurochip], Caltech, 26 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons.

In 2003 a team led by Theodore Berger, at the [[University of Southern California]], started work on a neurochip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic [[hippocampus]]. The neurochip was designed to function in rat brains and was intended as a prototype for the eventual development of higher-brain prosthesis. The hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most ordered and structured part of the brain and is the most studied area. Its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0,65422-0.html Coming to a brain near you]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910201747/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0%2C65422-0.html |date=10 September 2006  }}, ''Wired News'', 22 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the [[University of Florida]] used a culture of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a [[F-22]] fighter jet [[aircraft simulator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/11/02/brain.dish/ 'Brain' in a dish flies flight simulator], ''CNN'', 4 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a [[petri dish]] and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch]] and [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.

==Ethical considerations==
Important ethical, legal and societal issues related to brain-computer interfacing are:&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clausen|first1=Jens|title=Man, machine and in between|journal=Nature|volume=457|pages=1080–1081|year=2009|doi=10.1038/4571080a|pmid=19242454|issue=7233|bibcode = 2009Natur.457.1080C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haselager|first1=Pim|last2=Vlek|first2=Rutger|last3=Hill|first3=Jeremy|last4=Nijboer|first4=Femke|title=A note on ethical aspects of BCI|journal=Neural Networks|volume=22|pages=1352–1357|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2009.06.046|pmid=19616405|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamburrini|first1=Guglielmo|title=Brain to Computer Communication: Ethical Perspectives on Interaction Models|journal=Neuroethics|volume=2|pages=137–149|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9040-1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Attiah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attiah|first1=Mark A.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|title=Minds, motherboards, and money: futurism and realism in the neuroethics of BCI technologies|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=15 May 2014|volume=8|issue=86|pages=86|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2014.00086|pmid=24860445|pmc=4030132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuroethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nijboer|first1=Femke|last2=Clausen|first2=Jens|last3=Allison|first3=Brendan Z|last4=Haselager|first4=Pim|title=Stakeholders' opinions on ethical issues related to brain-computer interfacing|journal=Neuroethics|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9132-6|pmid=24273623|pmc=3825606|year=2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=541–578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* conceptual issues (researchers disagree over what is and what is not a brain-computer interface),&lt;ref name="Neuroethics" /&gt;
* obtaining informed consent from people who have difficulty communicating,
* risk/benefit analysis,
* shared responsibility of BCI teams (e.g. how to ensure that responsible group decisions can be made),
* the consequences of BCI technology for the quality of life of patients and their families,
* side-effects (e.g. neurofeedback of sensorimotor rhythm training is reported to affect sleep quality),
* personal responsibility and its possible constraints (e.g. who is responsible for erroneous actions with a neuroprosthesis),
* issues concerning personality and personhood and its possible alteration,
* blurring of the division between human and machine
* therapeutic applications and their possible exceedance,
* questions of research ethics that arise when progressing from animal experimentation to application in human subjects,
* [[Thought identification|mind-reading]] and privacy,
* [[mind-control]],
* use of the technology in advanced interrogation techniques by governmental authorities,
* selective enhancement and social stratification.
* communication to the media.

In their current form, most BCIs are far removed from the ethical issues considered above. They are actually similar to corrective therapies in function. Clausen stated in 2009 that “BCIs pose ethical challenges, but these are conceptually similar to those that bioethicists have addressed for other realms of therapy”.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; Moreover, he suggests that bioethics is well-prepared to deal with the issues that arise with BCI technologies. Haselager and colleagues&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; pointed out that expectations of BCI efficacy and value play a great role in ethical analysis and the way BCI scientists should approach media. Furthermore, standard protocols can be implemented to ensure ethically sound informed-consent procedures with locked-in patients.

The case of BCIs today has parallels in medicine, as will its evolution. Much as pharmaceutical science began as a balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements.&lt;ref name= "Attiah"/&gt; Researchers are well aware that sound ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.&lt;ref name="Neuroethics"/&gt;

==Future directions==
[[File:Brain-computer interface.jpeg|thumb|right|Brain-computer interface]]
A consortium consisting of 12 European partners has completed a roadmap to support the European Commission in their funding decisions for the new framework program [[Horizon 2020]]. The project, which was funded by the European Commission, started in November 2013 and ended in April 2015. The roadmap is now complete, and can be downloaded on the [http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/ project's webpage]. A 2015 publication led by Dr. Clemens Brunner describes some of the analyses and achievements of this project, as well as the emerging Brain-Computer Interface Society.&lt;ref name="bncihorizon2020"&gt;{{cite journal|title=BNCI Horizon 2020: towards a roadmap for the BCI community|doi=10.1080/2326263X.2015.1008956 | volume=2 | journal=Brain-Computer Interfaces|pages=1–10|year=2015 |last1=Brunner |first1=Clemens |last2=Birbaumer |first2=Niels |last3=Blankertz |first3=Benjamin |last4=Guger |first4=Christoph |last5=Kübler |first5=Andrea |last6=Mattia |first6=Donatella |last7=Millán |first7=José del R |last8=Miralles |first8=Felip |last9=Nijholt |first9=Anton |last10=Opisso |first10=Eloy |last11=Ramsey |first11=Nick |last12=Salomon |first12=Patric |last13=Müller-Putz |first13=Gernot R |url=http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/350349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this article reviewed work within this project that further defined BCIs and applications, explored recent trends, discussed ethical issues, and evaluated different directions for new BCIs. As the article notes, their new roadmap generally extends and supports the recommendations from the Future BNCI project managed by Dr. Brendan Allison, which conveys substantial enthusiasm for emerging BCI directions.

In addition to,&lt;ref name="bncihorizon2020"/&gt; other recent publications have explored the most promising future BCI directions for new groups of disabled users (e.g.,&lt;ref name="Wolpaw, J.R 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, B.Z., Dunne, S., Leeb, R., Millan, J., and Nijholt, A. (2013). Towards Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces: Bridging the Gap from Research to Real-World Applications.

Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;). Some prominent examples are summarized below.

===Disorders of consciousness (DOC)===
Some persons have a [[disorder of consciousness]] (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, as well as persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients who are able to perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there would seem to be a strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.&lt;ref&gt;Edlinger, G., Allison, B.Z., and Guger, C. (2015). "How many people could use a BCI system?" pp. 33–66 in ''Clinical Systems Neuroscience'', Kansaku, K., Cohen, L., and Birbaumer, N. (eds.) Springer Verlag Japan: Tokyo. {{ISBN|978-4-431-55037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/02699052.2012.698362|pmid=22759199|title=Brain–computer interfacing in disorders of consciousness|journal=Brain Injury|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1510–22|year=2012|last1=Chatelle|first1=Camille|last2=Chennu|first2=Srivas|last3=Noirhomme|first3=Quentin|last4=Cruse|first4=Damian|last5=Owen|first5=Adrian M.|last6=Laureys|first6=Steven|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/162403|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These and other articles describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with DOC. One major challenge is that these patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists, neck, leg, and/or other locations. Another challenge is that patients may fade in and out of consciousness, and can only communicate at certain times. This may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis. Some patients may only be able to respond to physicians' requests during a few hours per day (which might not be predictable ahead of time) and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis. Therefore, new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings, even without expert help, so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background can still use them. This reduces the cost, time, need for expertise, and other burdens with DOC assessment. Automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer, such as "Is your father named George?" or "Were you born in the USA?" Automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by (for example) focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate. The results could be presented to physicians and therapists, which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy. In addition, these patients could then be provided with BCI-based communication tools that could help them convey basic needs, adjust bed position and [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate.&lt;ref name=BolyMassimini2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boly M, Massimini M, Garrido MI, Gosseries O, Noirhomme Q, Laureys S, Soddu A |title=Brain connectivity in disorders of consciousness |journal=Brain Connectivity |year=2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1089/brain.2011.0049|pmid=22512333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00950|title=Multiple tasks and neuroimaging modalities increase the likelihood of detecting covert awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=950|year=2014|last1=Gibson|first1=Raechelle M.|last2=Fernã¡Ndez-Espejo|first2=Davinia|last3=Gonzalez-Lara|first3=Laura E.|last4=Kwan|first4=Benjamin Y.|last5=Lee|first5=Donald H.|last6=Owen|first6=Adrian M.|last7=Cruse|first7=Damian|pmid=25505400|pmc=4244609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00775|pmid=24312041|pmc=3834290|title=On ERPs detection in disorders of consciousness rehabilitation|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|pages=775|year=2013|last1=Risetti|first1=Monica|last2=Formisano|first2=Rita|last3=Toppi|first3=Jlenia|last4=Quitadamo|first4=Lucia R.|last5=Bianchi|first5=Luigi|last6=Astolfi|first6=Laura|last7=Cincotti|first7=Febo|last8=Mattia|first8=Donatella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research effort was supported in part by different EU-funded projects, such as the [http://www.decoderproject.eu/ DECODER] project led by Prof. Andrea Kuebler at the [[University of Würzburg|University of Wuerzburg]]. This project contributed to the first BCI system developed for DOC assessment and communication, called [http://www.mindbeagle.at/ mindBEAGLE]. This system is designed to help non-expert users work with DOC patients, but is not intended to replace medical staff. An EU-funded project that began in 2015 called [https://web.archive.org/web/20150518071837/http://www.eurekanetwork.org/fyrom/about/-/journal_content/56/10137/4607160 ComAlert] conducted further research and development to improve DOC prediction, assessment, rehabilitation, and communication, called "PARC" in that project. Another project funded by the National Science Foundation is led by Profs. Dean Krusienski and Chang Nam. This project provides for improved vibrotactile systems, advanced signal analysis, and other improvements for DOC assessment and communication.

===Motor recovery===
People may lose some of their ability to move due to many causes, such as stroke or injury. Several groups have explored systems and methods for motor recovery that include BCIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Remsik|first=Alexander|last2=Young|first2=Brittany|last3=Vermilyea|first3=Rebecca|last4=Kiekhoefer|first4=Laura|last5=Abrams|first5=Jessica|last6=Elmore|first6=Samantha Evander|last7=Schultz|first7=Paige|last8=Nair|first8=Veena|last9=Edwards|first9=Dorothy|date=2016-05-03|title=A review of the progression and future implications of brain-computer interface therapies for restoration of distal upper extremity motor function after stroke|journal=Expert Review of Medical Devices|volume=13|issue=5|pages=445–454|doi=10.1080/17434440.2016.1174572|issn=1743-4440|pmid=27112213|pmc=5131699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monge-Pereira|first=Esther|last2=Ibañez-Pereda|first2=Jaime|last3=Alguacil-Diego|first3=Isabel M.|last4=Serrano|first4=Jose I.|last5=Spottorno-Rubio|first5=María P.|last6=Molina-Rueda|first6=Francisco|title=Use of Electroencephalography Brain-Computer Interface Systems as a Rehabilitative Approach for Upper Limb Function After a Stroke: A Systematic Review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934148217305816|journal=PM&amp;R|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=918–932|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.04.016|pmid=28512066|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sabathiel|first=Nikolaus|last2=Irimia|first2=Danut C.|last3=Allison|first3=Brendan Z.|last4=Guger|first4=Christoph|last5=Edlinger|first5=Günter|date=2016-07-17|title=Paired Associative Stimulation with Brain-Computer Interfaces: A New Paradigm for Stroke Rehabilitation|journal=Foundations of Augmented Cognition: Neuroergonomics and Operational Neuroscience|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|pages=261–272|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-39955-3_25|isbn=9783319399546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079612316300449|last=Riccio|first=A.|last2=Pichiorri|first2=F.|last3=Schettini|first3=F.|last4=Toppi|first4=J.|last5=Risetti|first5=M.|last6=Formisano|first6=R.|last7=Molinari|first7=M.|last8=Astolfi|first8=L.|last9=Cincotti|first9=F.|pages=357–387|language=en|doi=10.1016/bs.pbr.2016.04.018|pmid=27590975|title=Brain-Computer Interfaces: Lab Experiments to Real-World Applications|volume=228|series=Progress in Brain Research|year=2016|isbn=9780128042168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, a BCI measures motor activity while the patient imagines or attempts movements as directed by a therapist. The BCI may provide two benefits: (1) if the BCI indicates that a patient is not imagining a movement correctly (non-compliance), then the BCI could inform the patient and therapist; and (2) rewarding feedback such as functional stimulation or the movement of a virtual avatar also depends on the patient's correct movement imagery.

So far, BCIs for motor recovery have relied on the EEG to measure the patient's motor imagery. However, studies have also used fMRI to study different changes in the brain as persons undergo BCI-based stroke rehab training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Várkuti|first=Bálint|last2=Guan|first2=Cuntai|last3=Pan|first3=Yaozhang|last4=Phua|first4=Kok Soon|last5=Ang|first5=Kai Keng|last6=Kuah|first6=Christopher Wee Keong|last7=Chua|first7=Karen|last8=Ang|first8=Beng Ti|last9=Birbaumer|first9=Niels|date=2012-05-29|title=Resting State Changes in Functional Connectivity Correlate With Movement Recovery for BCI and Robot-Assisted Upper-Extremity Training After Stroke|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=53–62|doi=10.1177/1545968312445910|pmid=22645108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Brittany Mei|last2=Nigogosyan|first2=Zack|last3=Remsik|first3=Alexander|last4=Walton|first4=Léo M.|last5=Song|first5=Jie|last6=Nair|first6=Veena A.|last7=Grogan|first7=Scott W.|last8=Tyler|first8=Mitchell E.|last9=Edwards|first9=Dorothy Farrar|date=2014|title=Changes in functional connectivity correlate with behavioral gains in stroke patients after therapy using a brain-computer interface device|journal=Frontiers in Neuroengineering|language=English|volume=7|pages=25|doi=10.3389/fneng.2014.00025|pmid=25071547|pmc=4086321|issn=1662-6443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future systems might include the fMRI and other measures for real-time control, such as functional near-infrared, probably in tandem with EEGs. Non-invasive brain stimulation has also been explored in combination with BCIs for motor recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mrachacz-Kersting|first=N.|last2=Voigt|first2=M.|last3=Stevenson|first3=A.J.T.|last4=Aliakbaryhosseinabadi|first4=S.|last5=Jiang|first5=N.|last6=Dremstrup|first6=K.|last7=Farina|first7=D.|title=The effect of type of afferent feedback timed with motor imagery on the induction of cortical plasticity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006899317303694|journal=Brain Research|language=en|volume=1674|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2017.08.025|pmid=28859916|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the work with BCIs for DOC, this research direction was funded by different public funding mechanisms within the EU and elsewhere. The [http://www.vereproject.eu/ VERE] project included work on a new system for stroke rehabilitation focused on BCIs and advanced virtual environments designed to provide the patient with immersive feedback to foster recovery. This project, and the RecoveriX project that focused exclusively on a new BCI system for stroke patients, contributed to a hardware and software platform called [http://www.recoverix.at/Home RecoveriX]. This system includes a BCI as well as a functional electrical stimulator and virtual feedback. In September 2016, a training facility called a [http://www.recoverix.at/Home recoveriX-gym] opened in Austria, in which therapists use this system to provide motor rehab therapy to persons with stroke.

===Functional brain mapping===
Each year, about 400,000 people undergo [[brain mapping]] during neurosurgery. This procedure is often required for people with tumors or epilepsy that do not respond to medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pharep.2015.01.016|pmid=25933984|title=Prospects of epileptogenesis prevention|journal=Pharmacological Reports|volume=67|issue=3|pages=663–8|year=2015|last1=Radzik|first1=Iwona|last2=Miziak|first2=Barbara|last3=Dudka|first3=Jarosław|last4=Chrościńska-Krawczyk|first4=Magdalena|last5=Czuczwar|first5=Stanisław J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible.

In several recent publications, BCI research experts and medical doctors have collaborated to explore new ways to use BCI technology to improve neurosurgical mapping. This work focuses largely on high gamma activity, which is difficult to detect with non-invasive means. Results have led to improved methods for identifying key areas for movement, language, and other functions. A recent article addressed advances in functional brain mapping and summarizes a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.09.015|pmid=25461213|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Advances in Electrocorticography|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|volume=41|pages=183–192|year=2014|last1=Ritaccio|first1=Anthony|last2=Brunner|first2=Peter|last3=Gunduz|first3=Aysegul|last4=Hermes|first4=Dora|last5=Hirsch|first5=Lawrence J.|last6=Jacobs|first6=Joshua|last7=Kamada|first7=Kyousuke|last8=Kastner|first8=Sabine|last9=Knight|first9=Robert T.|last10=Lesser|first10=Ronald P.|last11=Miller|first11=Kai|last12=Sejnowski|first12=Terrence|last13=Worrell|first13=Gregory|last14=Schalk|first14=Gerwin|pmc=4268064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexible devices===
[[Flexible electronics]] are [[polymer]]s or other flexible materials (e.g. [[silk]],&lt;ref name="KimSilk"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin, conformal bio-integrated electronics|volume=9|issue=6|pages=511–517|journal=Nature Materials|doi=10.1038/nmat2745|pmid=20400953|pmc=3034223|bibcode=2010NatMa...9..511K}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pentacene]], [[polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]], [[parylene]], [[polyimide]]&lt;ref name="Boppart"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|last1=Boppart|first1=SA|title=A flexible perforated microelectrode array for extended neural recording|volume=39|issue=1|pages=37–42|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|doi=10.1109/10.108125|pmid=1572679}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that are printed with [[electronic circuit|circuitry]]; the flexible nature of the [[organic compound|organic]] background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication techniques]] utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create [[integrated circuit]]s and [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS).&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite book | last = Blau|first = A| publisher = InTech|series = Applied Biomedical Engineering|date=August 2011|chapter = 5|pages = 84–122|url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-biomedical-engineering/prospects-for-neuroprosthetics-flexible-microelectrode-arrays-with-polymer-conductors|doi = 10.5772/23186|isbn =9789533072562|title = Applied Biomedical Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible electronics were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="KimBME"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Flexible and stretchable electronics for bio-integrated devices|volume=14|pages=113–128|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150018|pmid=22524391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural dust===
Neural dust is a term used to refer to millimeter-sized devices operated as [[Wireless power transfer|wirelessly powered]] nerve sensors that were proposed in a 2011 paper from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Wireless Research Center, which described both the challenges and outstanding benefits of creating a long lasting wireless BCI.&lt;ref name=Rabaey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabaey|first=J.

The '''CSIR Fourth Paradigm Institute''' (CSIR-4PI) formerly CMMACS is a unit of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]. The centre is involved in developing modelling approaches for illuminating the structure and evolution of complex systems.

==History==
In the late 1980s the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research realised the increasing importance of mathematical modelling and computer based simulations that were critical for understanding complex systems, which were used in a wide array of scientific research. Various fields that were previously thought to be purely observational and qualitative now needed the use of such technologies.

It was established in 1988 in the Belur Campus of the [[National Aerospace Laboratories]] (NAL), Bengaluru. The current Scientist-in-Charge of the centre is Dr.Vidyadhar Y Mudkavi

==Academics==
The institute offers opportunities of summer projects for B.E. / M.Sc. / M.Tech students twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmmacs.ernet.in/cmmacs/acaprog.html Academic programmes in C-MMACS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], '''crumpling''' is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional [[manifold]] undergoes disordered [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of [[Face_(geometry)#Ridge_or_.28n-2.29-face|ridge]]s and [[facet]]s with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is the subject of some interest the mathematical community within the discipline of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cerda | first1=Enrique | last2=Chaieb |first2=Sahraoui |last3=Melo | first3=Francisco| last4=Mahadevan| first4=L |title=Conical dislocations in crumpling | journal= nature | year= 1999| volume=401| doi=10.1038/43395| bibcode=1999Natur.401...46C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with [[compressive strength]] resulting from [[friction]]al interactions at [[Local property|locally]] flat facets between folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741–14745|arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of [[materials science]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== Significance of crumpling ==

The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibi| first1=M |last2=Bonn | first2=D| title=Effect of the material properties on the crumpling of a thin sheet.| journal= Soft matter |year=2017 | volume=3 |pages=4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed [[cellulose]] paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to [[Paper recycling|utilising waste paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Mechanical properties in crumple-formed paper derived materials subjected to compression| journal= Heilyon |year=2017 | volume=3 |issue=6| pages=e00329 | url= http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00329/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deane Keller''' (December 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; April 12, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[academic]], [[soldier]], [[art restorer]] and [[preservationist]]. He taught for forty years at [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Art|School of Fine Arts]] and during [[World War II]] was an officer with the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].

As a student at Yale, he earned degrees in history and science in 1923.  Further studies led to a B.F.A. from the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; Keller was awarded the [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Two Get Awards in Art Competition; Grand Prix de Rome Fellowships Go to Deane Keller and Joseph Kissilewski |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 May 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/05/05/archives/two-get-awards-in-art-competition-grand-prix-de-rome-fellowships-go.html |accessdate=28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow of  the [[American Academy in Rome]] (FAAR) for three years.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; After returning from Rome in 1929, Keller began his career as a member of the Yale faculty.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1685  |title=Deane Keller papers |website=Yale University Manuscripts and Archives |publisher=Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was interrupted by the Second World War, when he was asked by School of Fine Arts dean [[Theodore Sizer (art historian)|Theodore Sizer]] to serve as a fine arts officer in the U.S. Army's [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]]. At war's end, he returned to teach at Yale's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt; In total, Keller taught at Yale for forty years, retiring in 1979, and was also professor emeritus of painting at the [[Paier College of Art]].&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

Keller married Katherine Parkhurst Hall in 1938. He had two sons, [[Deane G. Keller]], 1940 – 2005, and William Keller, born in 1950.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

Deane |publisher=Monuments Men Foundation |url=http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Keller was primarily responsible for the identification and transportation of artworks in [[Tuscany, Italy]], the center of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and a major site of [[Nazi plunder|Nazi looting]].&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roach |first=Catherine |title=Collateral Damage |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=March 2003 |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/03_03/keller.html |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Pisa, Italy|Pisa]] and [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where Nazi troops had bombed churches, destroyed or dislocated public art, and seized paintings from museums including the [[Uffizi]].&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt; As they were discovered during the [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]], Keller repatriated lost works, including [[Giambologna]]'s statue of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de Medici]], a fixture of  Florence's [[Piazza della Signoria]]. He also documented damage to buildings and murals across Tuscany, taking thousands of photographs with Charles Bernholz.&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt;

One of Keller's most significant wartime undertakings was his attempt to preserve the murals of the [[Camposanto]], a medieval cemetery in Pisa. In July 1944, an American shelling started a fire that caused the frescoes to fracture.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Keller organized art experts and enlisted men to protect the mural pieces and protect the cemetery from further damage.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Restoration of the frescoes has continued for seventy years.  In recognition of his preservation efforts, an urn containing Keller's ashes was interred in the Camposanto in 2000.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;

==Honors==
* [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]], 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"/&gt;
* [[Legion of Merit]], 1946 (United States).
* [[British Empire Medal]], 1926 (United Kingdom).
* [[Crown of Italy Partisan Medal]], 1946 (Italy).
* [[Medal of the Opera]], Commune of Pisa
* [[Order of St John Lateran]], 1946. (Vatican).

Keller was posthumously recognized for his wartime activities. He was the first to enter Pisa liberated from Nazi, 02 Sept.1944, with the partisan Pierino Fornaciari, liaison officer, with whom he rescued many art works, in particular in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]]. His remains were apportioned and interred in New Britain, Connecticut and the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] in [[Pisa]]; that site is identified with an engraved marble slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| author-last1=Berge |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Cohen |author-first2=Bonni |author-last3=Newnham |author-first3=Nicole |title=The Rape of Europa |date=2006 |medium=film |publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting |url=https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his academic career, Keller was a prolific portrait painter. He was known as the "unofficial portraitist of the Yale faculty," completing over 160 portrait commissions for the university, including faculty, corporation board members, and two presidents. With one of his portrait subjects, [[Thomas G. Bergin]], Keller worked in collaboration by illustrating the book, ''On Sepulchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Foscolo, Ugo. Bergin, Thomas G., translator.

'''Deception technology''' is an emerging category of [[cyber security]] defense.  Deception technology products can detect, analyze, and defend against [[zero-day attack|zero-day]] and advanced attacks, often in real time.  They are automated, accurate,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Pingree quotes in article: {{cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3113055/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|work=CSO Online|author=Maria Korolov|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide insight into malicious activity within [[internal network]]s which may be unseen by other types of cyber defense. Deception technology enables a more proactive security posture by seeking to deceive the attackers, detect them and then defeat them, allowing the enterprise to return to normal operations.

Existing [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense-in-depth]] cyber technologies have struggled against the increasing wave of sophisticated and persistent human attackers.  These technologies seek primarily to defend a perimeter, but both [[firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Endpoint security|end-point security]] cannot defend a perimeter with 100% certainty. [[Cyber-attack]]ers can penetrate these networks and move unimpeded for months, stealing data and [[intellectual property]]. [[Heuristics]] may find an attacker within the network, but often generate so many alerts that critical alerts are missed. Since 2014 attacks have accelerated and there is evidence that cyber-attackers are penetrating traditional defenses at a rapidly increasing rate.

Deception technology considers the human attacker's point of view and methodology for exploiting and navigating networks to identify and [[Data theft|exfiltrate]] data. It integrates with existing technologies to provide new visibility into the internal networks, share high probability alerts and threat intelligence with the existing infrastructure.

==Technology: high level view==

Deception technology automates the creation of traps (decoys) and/or lures which are mixed among and within existing [[IT]] resources to provide a layer of protection to stop attackers that have penetrated the [[Computer network|network]]. Traps (decoys) are IT [[Asset (computer security)|assets]] that either use real licensed [[operating system]] software, or are emulations of these devices.

Traps (decoys) which use emulations can also imitate [[medical device]]s, [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/paymentweek/docs/pq2016_2020_final2|title=Payments Week Issue - go to page 42|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail point of sale systems, switches, routers and much more. Lures are generally real information technology resources (files of varying kinds) which are placed on actual IT assets.

Upon penetrating the network, attackers seek to establish a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] and then use this to identify and exfiltrate data and intellectual property. They begin moving laterally through the internal [[VLAN]]s and almost immediately will "look at" one of the traps (decoys). Interacting with one of these "decoys" will trigger an alert.  These alerts are very high probability and almost always coincide to an ongoing attack.  The deception is designed to lure the attacker in – the attacker may consider this a worthy asset and continue by injecting [[malware]].  Deception technology generally allows for automated static and dynamic analysis of this injected malware and provides these reports through automation to the security operations personnel.  Deception technology may also identify, through indicators of compromise (IOC), suspect end-points that are part of the compromise cycle.  Automation also allows for an automated memory analysis of the suspect end-point, and then automatically isolating the suspect end-point.  Many partner integrations allow for a variety of implementation paths for existing enterprise and government customers.

==Specialized applications==

[[Internet of things|Internet of things (IoT)]] devices are not usually scanned by legacy defense in depth cyber defense and remain prime targets for attackers within the network.  Deception technology can identify attackers moving laterally into the network from within these devices.

Integrated [[turnkey]] devices that utilize [[embedded operating system]]s, but do not allow these operating systems to be scanned or closely protected by embedded end-point or intrusion detection software are also well protected by a deception technology deployment in the same network. Examples include [[SCADA|process control systems (SCADA)]] used in many manufacturing applications on a global basis. Deception technology has been associated with the discovery of [[Zombie Zero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtmarko/2014/07/10/trojan-hardware-spreads-apts/|title=How a Scanner Infected Corporate Systems and Stole Data: Beware Trojan Peripherals|first=Kurt|last=Marko|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[attack vector]] wherein deception technology identified an attacker utilizing malware embedded in [[barcode reader]]s which were manufactured overseas.

[[Medical device]]s are particular vulnerable to cyber attacks within the healthcare networks.  As [[FDA]]-certified devices they are closed systems and not accessible to standard cyber defense software. Deception technology can surround and protect these devices and identify attackers using these for backdoor placement and data exfiltration. Recent documented cyber attacks on medical devices include [[x-ray machine]]s, [[CT scan]]ners, [[MRI]] scanners, [[blood gas]] analyzers, [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]] systems and many more. Networks utilizing these devices can be protected by deception technology. This attack vector, called [[MEDJACK|medical device hijack or medjack]], is estimated to have penetrated many hospitals worldwide.{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalproductsmag.com/article/2016/07/dangerous-state-medical-cybersecurity|title=The Dangerous State of Medical Cybersecurity|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized deception technology products are now capable of addressing the rise in [[ransomware]]. Select products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/trapx-launches-ransomware-deception-tool-cryptotrap|title=TrapX launches ransomware deception tool, CryptoTrap|date=25 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can deceive ransomware into engaging in an attack on a decoy resource, while isolating the infection points and alerting the cyber defense software team.

==History==

[[Honeypot (computing)|Honeypots]] were perhaps the first very simple form of deception.  A honeypot appeared simply as an unprotected information technology resource and presented itself in an attractive way to a prospective attacker already within the network.  The notion of honeypots deceiving attackers, perhaps delaying and identifying them, and then ultimately supporting efforts to shut down the attack was a good one.  Potential benefits aside, most early honeypots exhibit challenges with functionality, integrity and overall efficacy in meeting these goals. Key was the lack of automation that enabled broad scale of deployment. A deployment strategy would seek to cover the enterprise where up to tens of thousands of VLANS must be protected won't be economically efficient using manual processes and manual configuration.

The gap between legacy honeypots and modern deception technology has diminished over time and will continue to do so. Modern honeypots constitute the low end of the deception technology space today.

==Differentiation from competitive/cooperative technologies==
{{see also|Alarm fatigue}}
Traditional cyber defense technologies, such as firewalls and end-point security, generate many alerts. In a large enterprise the alert volume may reach, in some cases, millions of alerts per day. Security operations personnel cannot process most of the activity easily, yet it only takes one successful penetration to compromise an entire network.

Deception technology produces alerts that are the end product of a [[Binary number|binary]] process. Probability is essentially reduced to two values:  0% and 100%.  Any party that seeks to identify, [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]], enter, view any trap (decoy) or utilizes a lure is immediately identified by this behavior. Anyone touching these traps or lures should not be doing so.  This is an advantage over heuristics and probability-based approaches and the many thousands of extraneous alerts these techniques generate.

Best practice shows that deception technology is not a stand-alone strategy.  Deception technology is an additional compatible layer to the existing defense-in-depth cyber defense.  Partner integrations make it most useful and the goal is to add protection for the most advanced and sophisticated human attackers that will successfully penetrate the perimeter.

==Market size and adoption==
The technical innovation of deception technology been received by the market.  An [[industry analyst]] identified ten top technologies for information security in 2016, one of which were deception technology. 

An industry analyst predicted in August 2016 that the deception technology market is currently (in 2016) approximately $50 to $100 million globally, and further predicted $100 million to $200 million in revenue by 2018.  This same analyst earlier noted that, "by 2018 ... 10 percent of enterprises will use deception tools and tactics, and actively participate in deception operations against attackers". [[Gartner]] also noted deception technology as a "far underutilized technology that can provide serious advantages over attackers (cyber attackers)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/lawrence-pingree/2016/09/28/deception-related-technology-its-not-just-a-nice-to-have-its-a-new-strategy-of-defense/|title=Deception related technology - its not just a "nice to have", it's a new strategy of defense - Lawrence Pingree|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other important analysts have recently predicted a market size exceeding $1 billion by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3113444/security/deception-technology-grows-and-evolves.html|title=Deception technology grows and evolves|first=Maria|last=Korolov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is being fueled, in part, by continued, highly visible targeted attacks on large enterprise and government institutions globally.

Market Research Media estimates the cumulative deception technology market value at $12 billion (2017–2022), growing at about 19% CAGR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketanalysis.com/?p=398|title=Deception Cybersecurity Market Forecast 2017-2022|date=9 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16534">'''Dephosphorylation''' is the removal of a [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;) group from an [[organic compound]] by [[hydrolysis]]. It is a reversible [[post-translational modification]]. Dephosphorylation and its counterpart, [[phosphorylation]], activate and deactivate [[enzyme]]s by detaching or attaching phosphoric [[esters]] and [[anhydride]]s. A  notable occurrence of dephosphorylation is the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and inorganic phosphate.

Dephosphorylation employs a type of hydrolytic enzyme, or [[hydrolase]], which cleave ester bonds. The prominent hydrolase subclass used in dephosphorylation is [[phosphatase]]. Phosphatase removes phosphate groups by hydrolysing [[phosphoric acid]] monoesters into a [[phosphate ion]] and a molecule with a free [[hydroxyl]] (-OH) group.

The reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction occurs in every physiological process, making proper function of protein phosphatases necessary for organism viability. Because protein dephosphorylation is a key process involved in cell signalling, protein phosphatases are implicated in conditions such as cardiac disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.

==History==
The discovery of dephosphorylation came from a series of experiments examining the enzyme phosphorylase isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. In 1955, [[Edwin Krebs]] and [[Edmond Fischer]] used radiolabeled ATP to determine that phosphate is added to the serine residue of phosphorylase to convert it from its ''b'' to ''a'' form via phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FISCHER|first=EH|author2=KREBS, EG|title=Conversion of phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a in muscle extracts.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Sep 1955|volume=216|issue=1|pages=121–32|pmid=13252012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Krebs and Fischer showed that this phosphorylation is part of a kinase cascade. Finally, after purifying the phosphorylated form of the enzyme, phosphorylase ''a'', from rabbit liver, ion exchange chromatography was used to identify phosphoprotein phosphatase I and II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khandelwal|first=RL|author2=Vandenheede, JR |author3=Krebs, EG |title=Purification, properties, and substrate specificities of phosphoprotein phosphatase(s) from rabbit liver.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Aug 25, 1976|volume=251|issue=16|pages=4850–8|pmid=8449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of these dephosphorylating proteins, the reversible nature of  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been associated with a broad range of functional proteins, primarily enzymatic, but also including nonenzymatic proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid38740"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs EG, Beavo JA |title=Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of enzymes |journal=Annu.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hydroxyl groups belonging to neutral but polar [[amino acids]] such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine within specific target proteins is a fundamental part of the regulation of every physiologic process. Phosphorylation involves the covalent modification of the hydroxyl with a phosphate group through the nucleophilic attack of the alpha phosphate in ATP by the oxygen in the hydroxyl. Dephosphorylation involves removal of the phosphate group through a hydration reaction by addition of a molecule of water and release of the original phosphate group, regenerating the hydroxyl. Both processes are reversible and either mechanism can be used to activate or deactivate a protein. Phosphorylation of a protein produces many biochemical effects, such as changing its conformation to alter its binding to a specific ligand to increase or reduce its activity. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can be used on all types of substrates, such as structural proteins, enzymes, membrane channels, signaling molecules, and other [[kinases]] and phosphatases. The sum of these processes is referred to as phosphoregulation.&lt;ref name="pmid19547744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beltrao P, Trinidad JC, Fiedler D |title=Evolution of phosphoregulation: comparison of phosphorylation patterns across yeast species |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=e1000134 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19547744 |pmc=2691599 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deregulation of phosphorylation can lead to disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21904669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bononi A, Agnoletto C, De Marchi E |title=Protein kinases and phosphatases in the control of cell fate |journal=Enzyme Res |volume=2011 |issue= |pages=329098 |year=2011 |pmid=21904669 |pmc=3166778 |doi=10.4061/2011/329098 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-translational modification===
During the synthesis of proteins, polypeptide chains, which are created by ribosomes translating mRNA, must be processed before assuming a mature conformation. The dephosphorylation of proteins is a mechanism for modifying behavior of a protein, often by activating or inactivating an [[enzyme]]. Components of the protein synthetic apparatus also undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and thus regulate the rates of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid2349232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Celis JE, Madsen P, Ryazanov AG |title=Increased phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 during mitosis in transformed human amnion cells correlates with a decreased rate of protein synthesis |journal=Proc.

As part of postranslational modifications, phosphate groups may be removed from serine, threonine, or tyrosine. As such, pathways of intracellular signal transduction depend on sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a wide variety of proteins.

: ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⟶ ADP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP, acts as a free energy "currency" in all living organisms. In a spontaneous dephosphorylation reaction 30.5 kJ/mol is released, which is harnessed to drive cellular reactions. Overall, nonspontaneous reactions coupled to the dephosphorylation of ATP are spontaneous, due to the negative free energy change of the coupled reaction. This is important in driving oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is dephosphorylated to ADP and inorganic phosphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cellular level, the dephosphorylation of ATPases determines the flow of ions into and out of the cell. Proton pump inhibitors are a class of drug that acts directly on ATPases of the gastrointestinal tract.

===Dephosphorylation in other reactions===
Other molecules besides ATP undergo dephosphorylation as part of other biological systems. Different compounds produce different free energy changes as a result of dephosphorylation.&lt;ref name="Ox phosphorylation site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Experiment|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|work=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|publisher=Department of Chemistry, Washington University|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psilocybin also relies on dephosphorylation to be metabolized into psilocin and further eliminated. No information on psilocybin's effect on the change in free energy is currently available.

===Importance of Dephosphorylation in Photosystem II===
The first protein complex of the [[photosynthesis]] component [[light-dependent reactions]] is referred to as [[photosystem II]]. The complex utilizes an enzyme to capture photons of light, providing the greater photosynthesis process with all of the electrons needed to produce ATP. Photosystem II is particularly temperature sensitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamauchi|first=Yasuo|title=Plants switch photosystem at high temperature to protect photosystem II|journal=Nature Precedings|date=29 July 2011|url=http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6168/version/1/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and desphosphorylation has been implicated as a driver of plasticity in responding to varied temperature. Accelerated protein dephosphorylation in photosynthetic thylakoid membranes occurs at elevated temperatures, directly impacting the desphosphorylation of key proteins within the photosystem II complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokka|first=A|author2=Aro, EM |author3=Herrmann, RG |author4=Andersson, B |author5= Vener, AV |title=Dephosphorylation of photosystem II reaction center proteins in plant photosynthetic membranes as an immediate response to abrupt elevation of temperature.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=Aug 2000|volume=123|issue=4|pages=1525–36|pmid=10938368|doi=10.1104/pp.123.4.1525 |pmc=59108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of dephosphorylation in disease==

===Pathology===

Excessive dephosphorylation of the membrane ATPases and proton pumps in the gastrointestinal tract leads to higher secretory rates of caustic peptic acids. These result in heartburn and esophagitis. In combination with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection, peptic ulcer disease is caused by the elevated pH dephosphorylation elicits.&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=M|title=Proton pump inhibitors: update on their role in acid-related gastrointestinal diseases.|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=Jun 2005|volume=59|issue=6|pages=709–15|pmid=15924600|doi=10.1111/j.1368-5031.2005.00517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microtubule-associated protein [[tau]] is abnormally hyperphosphorylated when isolated from the brain of patients who suffer from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. This is due to the dysfunction of dephosphorylation mechanisms at specific amino acids on the tau protein. Tau dephosphorylation is catalysed by protein phosphatase-2A and phosphatase-2B. Deficiency or modification of one or both proteins may be involved in abnormal phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease&lt;ref name="pmid7838376"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gong CX, Grundke-Iqbal I, Iqbal K |title=Dephosphorylation of Alzheimer's disease abnormally phosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A |journal=Neuroscience |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=765–72 |date=August 1994 |pmid=7838376 |doi= 10.1016/0306-4522(94)90400-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dephosphorylation has also been linked to [[cardiac disease]], particularly the alteration of actin-myosin interactions that are key for providing the underlying force of a heartbeat. Dephosphorylation is a key part of the myosin cycling kinetics that directly control the actin-myosin interactions. When the dephosphorylation process is interrupted,  calcium dependent cardiac contraction is impaired or fully disabled.&lt;ref name="pmid22426213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheikh F, Ouyang K, Campbell SG |title=Mouse and computational models link Mlc2v dephosphorylation to altered myosin kinetics in early cardiac disease |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=1209–21 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22426213 |pmc=3314469 |doi=10.1172/JCI61134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also suggested that modifications to dephosphorylation impact physiological processes implicated in [[Diabetes mellitus]]. The kinetics of dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2, phosphoproteins are shown to be involved in insulin receptor signaling, and ''in vitro'' models demonstrate that changes to dephosphorylation kinetics impact upstream and downstream insulin stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid17068339"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhande R, Zhang W, Zheng Y |title=Dephosphorylation by default, a potential mechanism for regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2 |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=51 |pages=39071–80 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17068339 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M605251200 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatments===
Inhibition of proton pumps&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"/&gt; significantly decreases the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing the symptoms of acid-related diseases. The resulting change in pH decreases survival of the bacteria ''H.pylori'', a major cause of peptic ulcer disease. Once the proton pump inhibitor eradicates this bacteria within the gut, reversing erosive reflux.
Treating heart disease has improved with the use of drugs that inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] via dephosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=DS|author2=Summers, RJ |author3=Bengtsson, T |title=Regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity by G-protein coupled receptors: potential utility in treatment of diabetes and heart disease.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=Sep 2008|volume=119|issue=3|pages=291–310|pmid=18606183|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In the treatment of diabetes, [[sulfonylurea]] drugs are able to stimulate dephosphorylation of the glucose transporter [[GLUT4]], decreasing insulin resistance and increasing and glucose utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Müller|first=G|author2=Wied, S|title=The sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride, stimulates glucose transport, glucose transporter translocation, and dephosphorylation in insulin-resistant rat adipocytes in vitro.|journal=Diabetes|date=Dec 1993|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1852–67|pmid=8243832|doi=10.2337/diabetes.42.12.1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Dephosphorylation can play a key role in molecular biology, particularly [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] using [[restriction enzymes]]. The cut ends of a [[Cloning vector|vector]] may re-ligate during a ligation step due to phosphorylation. By using a desphosphorylating phosphatase, re-ligation can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Cloning manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sambrook|first=J|title=Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual|year=1989|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|edition=2nd|author2=Fritsch, E.F.|author3=Maniatis, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alkaline phosphatases are often sourced naturally, most commonly from calf intestine, and are abbreviated as [[Calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase|CIP]].&lt;ref name="pmid19838171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makovets S, Blackburn EH |title=DNA damage signalling prevents deleterious telomere addition at DNA breaks |journal=Nat.

The [[discrete dipole approximation]] (DDA) is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary geometry. Given a target of arbitrary geometry, one seeks to calculate its scattering and absorption properties. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire dipole moments in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled dipole approximation. It is closely related to method of moments, digitized Green's function, or volume integral equation method.

'''Economism''' is a term in [[Marxist]] discourse.  It was used by [[Lenin]] in his attacks on [[Karl Kautsky]] and the Social Democratic Party of late 19th and early 20th century Germany.

{{Quote|text=The Economists [in Russia] limited the tasks of the working class to an economic struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, etc., asserting that the political struggle was the business of the liberal bourgeoisie. They denied the leading role of the party of the working class, considering that the party should merely observe the spontaneous process of the movement and register events. In their deference to spontaneity in the working-class movement, the Economists belittled the significance of revolutionary theory and class-consciousness, asserted that socialist ideology could emerge from the spontaneous movement, denied the need for a Marxist party to instil socialist consciousness into the working-class movement, and thereby cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. The Economists, who opposed the need to create a centralized working-class party, stood for the sporadic and amateurish character of individual circles [or collectives]. Economism threatened to divert the working class from the class revolutionary path and turn it into a political appendage of the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=V.I.|title=A Talk With Defenders of Economism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/dec/06.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The charge of economism is frequently brought against revisionists by [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionists]], when economics, instead of politics, is placed in command of society; when primacy of the development of the productive forces is held over concerns for the nature and relations surrounding those productive forces. This debate was most notable upon [[Deng Xiaoping]] assuming leadership of the Communist Part of China, criticising the Maoist line as ultra-leftist and accusing them of building socialism before the economy was ready. Maoists in turn criticised Deng Xiaoping for abandoning socialism in favour of opening up the Chinese economy to capitalist reforms in a needless pursuit of expertise and recognition from capitalist nations to fuel growth.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

== Other uses ==
For bourgeois capitalist economists, "economism" is [[reductionism|reduction]] of all [[social fact]]s to [[economic]] dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an [[ideology]], in which [[supply and demand]] are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of [[neoclassical economics]] and blind faith in an "[[invisible hand]]" or "[[laissez-faire]]" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional [[ethics]] would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on [[politics|political]] and other [[culture|cultural]] dimensions in [[society]]. 

[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] social critic [[Albert Jay Nock]] used the term more broadly, denoting a moral and social philosophy "which interprets the whole sum of human life in terms of the production, acquisition, and distribution of wealth".  He went on to say "I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on which Western civilization will finally shatter itself.  Economism can build a society which is rich, prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material well-being.  It can not build one which is lovely, one which has savor and depth, and which exercises the irresistible power of attraction that loveliness wields.  Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the society it has built may be tired of itself, bored of its own hideousness, and may  despairingly consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nock |first=Albert Jay |title=Memoirs Of A Superfluous Man |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European studies''' is a field of study offered by many academic [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] that focuses on current developments in [[European integration]].

Some programmes offer a social science or public administration curriculum focusing on developments in the European Union. These programmes usually include a combination of political science, EU public policy, [[European history]], [[European law]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]]. Other universities approach the subject in a broader manner, including topics like [[European culture]], [[European literature]] and [[European languages]]. While all programmes focus on the study of the European Union, they often cover national topics (in a comparative perspective) as well.

The subject combines [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Disciplines that are involved in European studies include:

The '''Exploratorium''' is a museum in [[San Francisco]] that allows visitors to explore the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. It has been described by the ''New York Times'' as the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century, an achievement attributed to "the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program".&lt;ref name=Lawlessness&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=An Emphasis on Newton’s Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/the-new-exploratorium-opens-in-san-francisco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized as "a mad scientist's penny arcade, a scientific funhouse, and an experimental laboratory all rolled into one",&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Allison|title=A First Look at the New Exploratorium|url=http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/first-look-new-exploratorium|work=7x7 Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the participatory nature of its exhibits and its self-identification as a center for informal learning has led to it being cited as the prototype for participatory museums around the world.&lt;ref name=Thrill&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=The Thrill of Science, Tamed by Agendas|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium was founded by physicist and educator [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and opened in 1969 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]], its home until January 2, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Exploratorium reopened at Piers 15 and 17 on San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. The historic interior and exterior of Pier 15 was renovated extensively prior to the move, and is divided into several galleries mainly separated by content, including the physics of seeing and listening (Light and Sound), Human Behavior, Living Systems, Tinkering (including electricity and magnetism), the Outdoor Gallery, and the Bay Observatory Gallery, which focuses on local environment, weather, and landscape.

Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 participatory exhibits have been created, approximately 600 of which are on the floor at any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium to Show New Face in a New Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/science/exploratorium-to-reopen-on-san-francisco-bay-in-2013.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest net-zero museum in the country.&lt;ref name=SFGateNetZero&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium sets 'Net-Zero' energy goal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-sets-Net-Zero-energy-goal-4422432.php?t=6a884541ce|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium offers visitors a variety of ways—including exhibits, webcasts, websites and events—to explore and understand the world around them. In 2011, the Exploratorium received the [[National Science Board]] 2011 Public Service Science Award for its contributions to public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref name='NSF2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119077&amp;org=NSB&amp;from=news | title = San Francisco-based Exploratorium to Receive National Science Board's 2011 Public Service Award | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | date = April 4, 2011 | publisher = [[National Science Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Inside exploratorium.jpg|thumb|left|Exploratorium's main floor, in its original [[Palace of Fine Arts]] location (2009)]]

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Frank Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frank Oppenheimer]], founder of the Exploratorium]]
The Exploratorium is the brainchild of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], an experimental physicist and university professor. Oppenheimer, who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] with his brother [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], was diverted from an academic career when he was forced to resign from his position at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1949 as a result of an inquiry by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He was blacklisted from academic positions across the country, and withdrew with his family to run a Colorado [[cattle ranch]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|104–115}}

Oppenheimer also began lending a hand with science projects of local high school students, eventually becoming the sole science teacher at the high school in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]]. The field trips and experiments he did with his high school students would become a blueprint for the hands-on methods of teaching and learning he would later bring to the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|115–121}}
 
When Oppenheimer was invited to join the University of Colorado's physics department in 1959, he found himself less interested in traditional laboratory research and much more interested in exploring methods of provoking curiosity and inquiry.  He received a grant from the National Science Foundation, which he used to build models of nearly a hundred science experiments.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}} This "Library of Experiments" would become the core of the Exploratorium exhibit collection, and was the forerunner of the ''Exploratorium Cookbook'', a manual explaining how to build these basic science exhibits.&lt;ref name=Cookbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium Cookbook I: A Construction Manual for Exploratorium Exhibits |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |work=Exploratorium Publications |publisher=The Exploratorium |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045619/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for public museums to supplement science curricula at all levels, he toured Europe and studied museums on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. Three European museums, encountered during that year, served as important influences on the founding of the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.

Back in the United States, Oppenheimer was invited to do the initial planning for a new branch of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but he turned it down to work on what he called his "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to [[San Francisco]] with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding and support for the endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the [[San Francisco Foundation]] made the museum realizable.

In late August 1969, the Exploratorium opened with little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts. Oppenheimer "simply opened the doors".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152}} Although the building needed many improvements, Oppenheimer couldn't afford to make the changes, and decided to allow the public to come and watch exhibits being built and changes being made as part of the participatory ethos of the institution.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|title=Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens - Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up|last=[[K.C.

C.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2009|isbn=978-0-226-11347-0}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-11-03 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128–152}}&lt;ref name="MuseAsLab"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Exploratorium - The Museum as Laboratory|last=Hein|first=Hilde|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87474-466-8|pages=4–21}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2013-01-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An early proposal would have erected a wall between the workshop where exhibits were being developed and the main visitor areas.  Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|156}} Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of [[George Gamow]], a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152,157}} The inscription said "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|157}}  (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.)

Oppenheimer served as the museum’s director until his death in 1985. Dr. Robert L. White served as director from 1987 to 1990. Dr. [[Goéry Delacôte]] served as executive director from 1991 until 2005.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Goéry Delacôte: Executive Profile &amp; Biography|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=2309151&amp;privcapId=2221131|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dennis Bartels served as executive director of the Exploratorium from 2006 to 2016. In June 2016, the Exploratorium welcomed its newest director, Chris Flink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/chris-flink-selected-as-new-exploratorium-executive-director Chris Flink Selected as New Exploratorium Executive Director | Exploratorium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has expanded greatly since the 1980s, increasing outreach, expanding programs for educators, creating an expanded Web presence, and forming museum partnerships around the world.

===Move to Piers 15 and 17===
The Exploratorium relocated from the Palace of Fine Arts to Piers 15 and 17, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] along the San Francisco Embarcadero, in April 2013. The Piers location was identified by Goéry Delacôte and then-board chairman Van Kasper as a potential space for relocation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Build: The Making of a Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-66-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution exempting the museum’s 66-year lease of the piers from San Francisco’s competitive bidding process due to its unique nature as a cultural and educational institution.&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadiq|first=Sheraz|title=Exploratorium Unveils Plans for New Home|url=http://science.kqed.org/quest/2010/10/19/exploratorium-unveils-plans-for-new-home/|work=QUEST|publisher=KQED|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project, which required substantial construction and renovation, occurred on October 19, 2010. The Exploratorium holds a 66-year lease on the piers with the Port of San Francisco. Exhibits are currently only viewable at the  Pier 15 campus; Pier 17 houses some staff, with the option for future expansion.&lt;ref name=Perlman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium in S.F. beginning work on new home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-in-S-F-beginning-work-on-new-home-3170176.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers 15 and 17 are historic piers, built in 1931 and 1912 respectively.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Under: The World Below the Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-67-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}    In 1954, the area between the piers was infilled and paved over. This infill was removed as part of the construction phase, restoring the space between the piers to public plazas, a pedestrian bridge, and open water.

==Architecture and design==

===Renovation of Piers 15 and 17===
[[File:Rust wedge.jpg|thumb|upright|Outdoors "Rust Wedge" display shows the enormous expansive force of [[rust|rusting iron]]]]
The Exploratorium campus comprises  {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of indoor and outdoor exhibit space, and includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of freely accessible public space. The exhibits are housed in and around Pier 15, which extends over {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the Bay.&lt;ref name=MovingScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Beato|first=Greg|title=The Science of Moving Science Across Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/how-the-exploratorium-in-san-francisco-moved-across-town.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was designed by architecture firm [[EHDD]].&lt;ref name=Breakthrough&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Lydia |title=Breakthrough at San Francisco's Exploratorium |url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The Architect's Newspaper |date=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517153030/http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor,&lt;ref name="Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerfen|first=Katie|title=Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/exploratorium-designed-by-ehdd_o|accessdate=4 August 2015|newspaper=THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]] as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades leading up to the Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Nearly two thirds of the [[piling]]s under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new pilings were sunk.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Several pilings were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An effort was made in the construction of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15.  The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of [[lead paint]], revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be seen. Some of the preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-68-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Other challenges to the design of the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The fritting also makes the reflective surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.&lt;ref name=TakingFlight&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber |first=Dan |title=Bird-safe building standards taking flight in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908200100/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pier 15 incorporated two seismic joints as part of its [[seismic retrofit]], one separating the Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass in the event of an earthquake, significantly reducing the potential [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] stress.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

The aesthetic of the project was defined as "industrial naval chic" in keeping with the pier’s history.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|63}}

===Restaurant===
[[File:Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|The design scheme for the Exploratorium's Seaglass Restaurant was inspired by the exhibit ''Color of Water''.]]
The design aesthetic for both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass Restaurant was created by designer Olle Lundberg and based on the exhibit ''Color of Water''. The bar at Seaglass features a specially designed version of Exploratorium artist Shawn Lani’s exhibit ''Icy Bodies''.&lt;ref name=Feasters&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier-Johnson|first=Pat|title=Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium: A Sense for the Feasters|url=http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|work=The Connected Traveler|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204423/http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LorettaKeller&gt;{{cite web|last=Pape|first=Allie|title=Loretta Keller's Exploratorium Duo to Open April 17|url=http://sf.eater.com/archives/2013/03/25/loretta_kellers_exploratorium_restaurants_to_open_april_17.php|work=SF Eater|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a net-zero energy goal as part of its overall sustainability efforts. Setting this net-zero goal means that, while in operation, The Exploratorium will produce more energy on-site than it will consume on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Drury B.|last2=Torcellini|first2=Paul A., Ph.D., P.E.|title=Understanding Zero-Energy Buildings|journal=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|date=September 2006|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum highlights its sustainability efforts in visible ways throughout the museum as part of a stated intention to lead by example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=22|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TruongEcoFriendly&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Landmark museum to reopen as most energy-efficient institute on Earth|url=https://news.yahoo.com/landmark-museum-to-reopen-as-most-eco-friendly-institute-on-earth-195905286.html|work=Yahoo!

The Exploratorium, in order to reach its net-zero energy goal, produces energy with a roof-mounted array of [[photovoltaics]].  There are 5,874 PV modules on the roof, totaling {{convert|78,712|sqft|m2}}, with a projected year-1 yield of 1.3 MW-AC/square foot (13.9 MW-AC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or a total year-1 yield of 2,113,715 kWh.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet: Environmentally Conscious Inside and Out|url=http://www.ehdd.com/sites/ehdd2/images/6275/Exploratorium%20Sustainability%20Project%20Sheet.pdf|website=EHDD Architecture|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus energy generated is intended to be fed back into the utility grid, as the projected annual energy use for the building totals at 1,275,936 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium's Net-Zero Energy Goal for New Waterfront Home 2013|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013|website=Exploratorium|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abellon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon, P.E.|first1=Devin A.|title=Exploratorium's New Waterfront Home Features Innovative Radiant System Using SF Bay Water|url=http://uponor.media-resources-ordp.com/casestudies/exploratorium.shtml|website=Uponor, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium, San Francisco.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium]]
In addition to solar power, the museum makes use of an [[HVAC]] system that takes advantage of the relatively constant, moderate temperature of the bay water under the piers, which is {{convert|50|to|65|F|C}}, to heat and cool the building. The bay water is filtered and sterilized before it is brought into a {{convert|4,000|USgal|m3}} cistern below the pier, where it is held for use.  When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium [[heat exchanger]], of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon|first1=Devin|title=Exploring Every Possibility|url=http://www.edcmag.com/articles/95153-the-exploratorium-at-pier-15|website=EDC: The Official Magazine for the LEED Professional|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are {{convert|27|mi|km}} of plastic tubing in the [[radiant heating]] system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt; After the bay water passes through the heat exchangers, it is returned to the San Francisco Bay as allowed by a permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDER NO. R2-2010-0082|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2010/R2-2010-0082.pdf|website=California Environmental Protection Agency: State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=California Regional Water Quality Control Board: San Francisco Bay Region|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the energy savings are expected to come from using the bay water as a [[heat sink]] for the building’s cooling needs.  When the temperature of the bay water is below that of the chilled water return from the radiant pipes, which is the case for most of the year in the Bay Area’s temperate climate, the system works in waterside [[economizer]] mode.  In this mode, the cooling loads are met either entirely or partially through passive heat exchange between the colder bay water and the warmer return water, greatly reducing the building’s energy needs.&lt;ref name=Abellon /&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a separate system for its ventilation needs, pairing a [[dedicated outdoor air system]] (DOAS) with [[displacement ventilation]] distribution to bring outdoor air into the building.  By integrating radiant heating and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air.  Reducing the size of a building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straube|first1=John|title=The Perfect HVAC|url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-022-the-perfect-hvac|website=Building Science Corporation|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has multiple features designed to reduce its water consumption.  Two large cisterns under the structural beams connecting the southeast pilings capture up to {{convert|338,000|USgal|m3}} of rainwater and fog runoff for reuse in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=17|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plumbing is designed for water conservation, with [[waterless urinal]]s and [[dual-flush toilet]]s projected to save an annual million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the bay water heating and cooling system is estimated to save two million gallons of potable water a year by eliminating the need for traditional evaporative cooling towers.&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"/&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 also makes use of natural light in the effort to reduce energy loads.  The existing building had many clerestory windows and an overhead skylight that runs the length of the interior space.  In compliance with historic preservation requirements, the building’s façade was left mostly unchanged, allowing for much of the interior space to benefit from the existing architecture’s ample daylight.  The retrofit did include the addition of high performance glazing to the existing windows.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerfen|first1=Katie|title=Exploratorium|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/cultural-projects/exploratorium.aspx|website=Architect Magazine: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Young|first1=Mignon|title=Sustainability Around The Bay|url=http://www.gabreport.com/2014/05/sustainability-around-the-bay|website=GAB: Green Architecture and Building Report|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Exploratorium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum certification.&lt;ref name="USGBC Scorecard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium at Piers 15/17 LEED Scorecard|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/exploratorium-piers-1517|website=US Green Building Council|publisher=US Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "After a two-year post-opening shakedown period of monitoring and adjusting the systems, the Exploratorium hopes to become the largest net-zero-energy-use museum in the United States and possibly the world."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Christopher|title=A San Francisco Museum, Reborn on the Bay|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/travel/a-san-francisco-museum-reborn-on-the-bay.html|accessdate=2013-08-07|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also turning its commitment to sustainability into a learning experience by showcasing elements of the building’s green design on site.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;

==Layout==
The new site contains over 600 exhibits, 25% of which were developed specifically for the Pier 15 site. With the exception of some art installations, all exhibits are developed and made onsite.&lt;ref name=OpensApril10&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium opens April 10 at Pier 15|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Exploratorium-opens-April-10-at-Pier-15-4430723.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoor and outdoor spaces are divided into six galleries, each highlighting a specific content group. Many exhibits are mobile, however, and move among different galleries; similarly, not all exhibits fall into distinct categories.

Exhibits cover a range of subject areas, including [[human perception]] (such as vision, hearing, learning and cognition), the life sciences, physical phenomena (such as light, motion, electricity, waves and resonance, and magnetism), local environment (water, wind, fog, rain, sun, and other elements, as well as cityscape, landscape, and the flora and fauna of the Bay) and human behavior (such as cooperation, competition, and sharing).&lt;ref name=MuseumGalleries&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Galleries|url=http://exploratorium.edu/visit/galleries/|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osher West Gallery: Human Behavior===
[[File:Blowing Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors collaborate to make a [[smoke ring]] at the Exploratorium's previous location at the Palace of Fine Arts]]
The West Gallery focuses on human behavior.  Its signage and exhibits encourage visitors to play with perception; investigate memory, emotion, and judgment; and experiment with how people cooperate, compete, and share. It holds exhibits such as ''Poker Face'' (partners try to assess when someone is bluffing), ''Trust Fountain'' (an experimental exhibit from the museum’s [[National Science Foundation]]-funded Science of Sharing project, this two-person drinking fountain is based on the [[Prisoner’s dilemma]], a classic scenario centering on negotiation and trust),&lt;ref name=GalleriesExhibits&gt;{{cite web|title=Galleries and Exhibit Highlights|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/galleries-and-exhibit-highlights|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tactile Dome'', a pitch-black environment visitors explore by touch, which was originally designed by [[August Coppola]].&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmann|first=Jay|title=August Coppola, Brother of Francis, Creator of Tactile Dome, Dies at 75|url=http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|work=SFist.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813044417/http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Gallery also included the temporary exhibition ''The Changing Face of What is Normal: Mental Health'', which showcased the personal artifacts of patients from the now-decommissioned Willard Psychiatric Center,&lt;ref name=Lawlessness /&gt; which was on view through April 2014.

The West Gallery also houses the Kanbar Forum, a cabaret-style theater that will host music events, science lectures, and other programs when it opens in summer 2013.&lt;ref name=sparkling&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Heather|title=San Francisco's Exploratorium opens in sparkling new home|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/tech/innovation/new-exploratorium|work=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Gallery: Tinkering===
The South Gallery is a workshop area where visitors can engage in learning through [[maker movement|hands-on making]], located directly across from the Exploratorium's own internal exhibit workshop, which is also open to their view. Oppenheimer wanted visitors to be able to “smell the oil”, and insisted that the usually hidden exhibit-building activities be on display as an exhibit in its own right.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Exploratorium Reborn: Inside San Francisco's New Innovation Shrine|url=https://gizmodo.com/5994274/exploratorium-reborn-inside-san-franciscos-new-shrine-to-innovation|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits in the South Gallery highlight a [[DIY]] aesthetic, and include ''Animation Stations'' where visitors can make their own [[stop motion|stop-motion films]].

Artworks on display include the ''Tinkerer’s Clock'' (a 22-foot-high clock constructed by artist [[Tim Hunkin]], with figurines in his noted cartoon style that can be manipulated by visitors and unfold into a clockface on the hour); and ''Rolling Through The Bay'' (a sculpture made by artist Scott Weaver over the course of 37 years, utilizing over 100,000 toothpicks and depicting many of the Bay Area’s iconic landmarks, through which a ping-pong ball can roll on one of several different "tours").&lt;ref name=rolling&gt;{{cite web|last=Koh|first=Barbara|title=At the Exploratorium – Scott Weaver’s Amazing Toothpick Art|url=http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/sfevents/p/At-The-Exploratorium-Scott-Weavers-Amazing-Toothpick-Art.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechtel Central Gallery: Seeing and Listening===
[[File:Giant Mirror at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|A visitor investigates the reflective properties of the Giant Mirror in the Central Gallery of the Exploratorium at Pier 15.]]
The Bechtel Central gallery houses many of the "classic" Exploratorium exhibits, including many of those that have been on display since the very earliest years of the museum.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; It includes a mix of new and old exhibits that investigate physics and the perception of light, color, and sound, such as ''Sound Bite'' (a demonstration of hearing with the jawbone instead of the ears) and ''Bright Black'' (a trick of perception convinces viewers that an object is white when it is almost entirely black).

===East Gallery: Living Systems===
The East Gallery houses a much-expanded selection of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate directly to the immediate local environment, such as the ''Glass Settling Plate'' (barnacles and other creatures are grown on a plate in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the ''Algae Chandelier'' (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the ''Live Chicken Embryo'' (one of the oldest of the Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium shows off its huge new digs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579443-1/san-francisco-exploratorium-shows-off-its-huge-new-digs/|work=CNET|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery===
The Bay Observatory building is the only new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as ''Oculus'' (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery to be used as a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), ''Visualizing the Bay'' (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the ''Map Table'' (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkes|first=Alison|title=The Exploratorium’s new eyes on the bay|url=http://baynature.org/2013/04/18/the-exploratoriums-new-eyes-on-the-bay/|work=Bay Nature Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Observatory also houses the Wired Pier project, which consists of more than a dozen sensors on and around the Bay Observatory that stream real-time data about the surrounding environment, such as quality of air and bay water, weather, tides and pollution, and compile it into interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name=Plutchak&gt;{{cite web|last=Plutchak|first=Rochelle|title=NOAA Science Has  Home at the New Exploratorium|url=http://research.noaa.gov/InDepth/Features/CurrentFeature/TabId/728/ArtMID/1884/ArticleID/10044/NOAA-Science-Has-a-Home-at-the-New-Exploratorium.aspx|work=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Website|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Gallery===
[[File:Fog Bridge at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|Mist from Fujiko Nakaya’s Fog Bridge drifts over the water between Piers 15 and 17 at the Exploratorium.]]
The Outdoor Gallery comprises the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct interaction with the Bay environment, which can be seen in exhibits such as ''Color of Water'' (an installation of 32 distinct [[Textile sample|color swatches]] suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is ''Remote Rains'', which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the Hydrometeorology Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of [[NOAA]] research data on storms.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300M digs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130410/us-travel-san-francisco-new-exploratorium/|work=Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the publicly accessible bridge connecting Piers 15 and 17, artist [[Fujiko Nakaya]] created an installation called ''Fog Bridge #72494'' that creates bursts of fog for six minutes every half-hour as the first in a series of large-scale temporary installations called ''Over the Water''.&lt;ref name=overthewater&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Water|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/over-the-water|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Fog Bridge'' is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long and makes use of 800 nozzles to create the fog, which Nakaya hopes will inspire visitors to pay attention to the nature of one of San Francisco’s best-known weather patterns.  Although originally slated to be temporary, it is now on permanent display. A desalination system, located in Pier 17, conditions bay water for use in the artwork. &lt;ref name=Aleta&gt;{{cite web|last=Aleta|first=George|title=An Artist Creates Artificial Fog in San Francisco|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/artscience/2013/04/an-artist-creates-artificial-fog-in-san-francisco|work=Smithsonian Magazine Blog|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miranda" /&gt;

===Public space===
The Exploratorium campus includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of publicly accessible open space. This includes the plaza facing on the Embarcadero, the connector bridge between Piers 15 and 17 where ''Fog Bridge # 72494'' is installed, the south apron of Pier 17, and the east and south aprons of Pier 15. This public space overlaps with the Outdoor Gallery, and includes some notable exhibits, such as the ''Aeolian Harp'' (an expanded version of the original installation by Doug Hollis on the roof of the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts, first created in collaboration with Frank Oppenheimer in 1976)&lt;ref name=aeolian&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeolian Harp|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/aeolian-harp|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Bay Windows'' (visitors spin disks filled with samples of Bay mud, sand, and gravel gathered from five distinct regions of the Bay itself).&lt;ref name=baywindows&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Windows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/bay-windows|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant===
The lower level of the Bay Observatory Building houses the Seaglass Restaurant, which, like the Seismic Joint Cafe, is open to unticketed members of the public. Both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass are run by Loretta Keller, chef-owner at Coco500, in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.

==Educational programs==
The Exploratorium seeks to bring hands-on inquiry to education, including training teachers in the teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Teacher Institute===
[[File:Exploratorium teachers.jpg|thumb|right|Teachers from the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute examine the "String Thing" they built]]
The Teacher Institute, founded in 1984, is an Exploratorium-based professional development program geared towards middle and high school science teachers. In addition to providing workshops at the museum that teach hands-on and inquiry-based teaching methods, it provides coaches and support for novice teachers. Studies have shown that while 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within five years, the retention rate for teachers who go through the Teacher Institute is 85 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=Olney&gt;{{cite news|last=Olney|first=Jennifer|title=Teachers participate in intense training program|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/focus_on_solutions&amp;id=8775413|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teacher Institute is also home to the [[Iron Science Teacher]], a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching, which originated at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, ''[[Iron Chef]]'', this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail. Contestants are currently or formerly part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher". Shows are also archived on the Exploratorium's website.&lt;ref name=IronScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title='Iron Science Teacher' competitors at Exploratorium use museum paper as secret ingredient in fun demos|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_20993010/iron-science-teacher-competitors-at-exploratorium-use-museum|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury News|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two out of three teachers applying were being turned away due to space limitations, by the time the Exploratorium closed at its former location; following the move to the Piers, the Exploratorium has been expanding its professional development for teachers through the Teacher Institute.&lt;ref name=Olney /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, two [[MOOC]] courses were also being made available through MOOC provider [[Coursera]]. One course integrates engineering into middle and high school [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] classrooms, and the other integrates [[maker movement|making and tinkering activities]] into elementary and middle school classrooms.&lt;ref name=Coursera&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Booker|title=Coursera Online Hub Offers Teachers Development|url=http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615031051/http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning programs===
The Exploratorium operates several programs centering on informal learning. The Institute for Inquiry (IFI) is a professional development program of the Exploratorium geared towards educators, scientists, administrators, and policymakers. The Institute is a recipient of National Science Foundation funding and designs programs, materials and tools to help leaders in the science education community further the role of inquiry in elementary science education and strengthen reform efforts. It consists of workshops and an online library of resources available to participants in the Institute.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{Cite report |author=Inverness Research Associates |authorlink= |date=June 2001 |title=Report: The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry Four Cornerstone Claims|url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/2001-11-ExplorIFI-4CornerstnClaims/2001-11-Rpt-ExploratrmIFI_4CornerstnClaims-Execsum.PDF |publisher=Inverness Research |page=ii |docket= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Inquiry partnered with the [[Sonoma Valley Unified School District]] on a program combining science education with [[English Language Development]] (ELD). Data from the two-year pilot study showed that a professional development program designed to help teachers integrate ELD strategies into science lessons had a significant, measurable impact on the achievement of students in both ELD and in science.&lt;ref name=innovation&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Narrative: Integrating English Language Development and Science: A Professional Development Approach|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/narratives/u396c100434.pdf|work=Investing in Innovation Fund Website|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a collaboration between the Exploratorium, the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], and [[King's College London]]. CILS studies the intersection between museums and schools as centers of informal learning with the intention of understanding how informal science learning occurs and how informal educational centers such as the Exploratorium can contribute to science education reform.&lt;ref name=CILS&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Details: Center for Informal Learning and Schools|url=http://informalscience.org/projects/ic-000-000-001-775/Center_for_Informal_Learning_and_Schools|work=Informal Science|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tinkering Studio began in 2008 as an in-house program geared towards [[maker culture]] and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within the museum in a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe,&lt;ref name=tinkering&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Julian|title=Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio makes science fun|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-s-Tinkering-Studio-makes-science-fun-2295556.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite news|last=Raker|first=Silva|title=Exploratorium expanding minds in Mideast|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Exploratorium-expanding-minds-in-Mideast-4395559.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, in collaboration with the Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the [[Discovery Science Center]], the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.&lt;ref name=cwsnetwork&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Michalchik |first1=Vera|last2=Remold|first2=Julie|last3=Verdugo |first3=Renato|date=March 2013 |title=California Tinkering Afterschool Network Pilot Year Evaluation Report |url=http://cswnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CA-Tinkering-Afterschool-Network-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf |publisher=SRI International |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium also houses a number of other educational resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital science teaching resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars [[Curiosity Rover]] launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published a number of books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.

===Educational outreach===
The Exploratorium operates several educational outreach programs. The Community Outreach Program works with community organizations to provide exhibit-based educational activities for underserved children and families in the local community.&lt;ref name=tecolote&gt;{{cite news|last=Leibrich|first=Ryan|title=New Exploratorium location opens its doors|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=El Tecolote|date=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204600/http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also home to XTech, a science education program for underserved middle school students. Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.&lt;ref name=xtech&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Carroll |first1=Becky |last2=Castori |first2=Pam |last3=Smith |first3=Anita |date=September 2009 |title=The Exploratorium's XTech Program: Engaging STEM Experiences for Middle School Youth |url=http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |publisher=Inverness Research |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133042/http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explainers===
The Exploratorium Explainer program, which has been operating since the museum opened, hires and trains high school students and young educators each year. The program tripled its capacity, hiring 300 Explainers, following the relocation to Pier 15 in 2013.&lt;ref name=KTVU&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300 million waterfront facility |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=KTVU |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411173430/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explainers function essentially as docents. There are two types of Explainers: High School Explainers, who are teenagers, and Field Trip Explainers, who are college students and young educators. The program was conceived by Frank Oppenheimer in the early days of the museum. He wanted to provide a visitor experience that was a learning experience in a museum context&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD |title=Explainers' development of science-learner identities through participation in a community of practice |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204432/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |last=Richardson |first=Anne |year=2011 |publisher=Antioch University |accessdate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for guesswork and the absence of "correct" answers. He felt young people would be more capable than adults at conveying the open-ended experience he was looking for. His plan with the Explainers was to "loosen up the whole feeling of learning." Oppenheimer also intended the program to allow students to experience learning outside the framework of their school systems. The Explainers come from a highly diverse array of socioeconomic backgrounds, and he hoped they would bring families and friends who would not otherwise be likely to visit a museum.&lt;ref name=Cole /&gt;{{rp|169–174}} Both the High School and Field Trip Explainers are paid positions.

The Explainer Program was inspired by the staff demonstrations Frank observed at the Palais de la Decouverte, although the facilitators at the Palais when Oppenheimer visited were either graduate students or practicing scientists. The success of the Exploratorium’s Explainer program led the Palais to eventually hire teenage explainers of their own.&lt;ref name=ASTC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duensing|first=Sally|title=Exporting the Exploratorium:  Creating a "Culture of Learning"|journal=ASTC Dimensions|date=November–December 1999|url=http://www.astc.org/pubs/dimensions/1999/nov-dec/exporting.htm|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Explainers often cite their experiences at the Exploratorium as defining elements of their success,&lt;ref name=Hamlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamlin|first=Jesse|title=Learning From Teaching at the Exploratorium / Student guides' lessons went beyond science|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Learning-From-Teaching-at-the-Exploratorium-2914198.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; including several notable tech CEOs.&lt;ref name=verisign&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan|title=Profile of VeriSign chairman, CEO|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Linda|title=Backyard science today, an innovative workforce tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/backyard-science-today-an-innovative-workforce-tomorrow|work=The National|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Walter Kitundu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Kitundu]] - Artist in Residence and MacArthur Fellow]]
Despite being generally thought of as a science museum, the Exploratorium has always incorporated both science and art. As early as 1966, Frank Oppenheimer presented a paper discussing the connections between art and science, and the role of a museum in appealing to both casual visitors and serious students of all ages.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The formal artist in residence program was started in 1974,&lt;ref name=AIR&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist-in-Residence Program|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artist-residence|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but artworks such as Bob Miller’s ''Sun Painting'' were commissioned shortly after the museum was opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=BobMiller&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Miller|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers/bob-miller|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the artist in residence program, over 250 artworks in various disciplines have been created.

Each year, the museum invites ten to twenty artists to participate in residencies ranging from two weeks to two years. Artists-in-residence work with staff and the visiting public to create original installations, exhibits, or performances. Artists are given a stipend, housing, travel expenses, and technical support, and they have at their disposal the Exploratorium's full array of metal and woodworking shops and materials. Two artists-in-residence who went on to become staff members have been awarded [[MacArthur Fellowship]] "genius" grants: [[Walter Kitundu]] and [[Ned Kahn]].

The new Embarcadero campus opened with more than 40 pieces by prominent artists, including Douglas Hollis, [[Golan Levin]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Amy Balkin]], and [[Fujiko Nakaya]]. The Center for Art and Inquiry, a new project at the new location, is an initiative to catalyze and orchestrate art across the museum.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|title=Painting the Sun and Sculpting Fog|url=http://www.artnews.com/2013/03/20/the-new-exploratorium/|work=ARTnews|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Artful Science from Sunny California |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13318084.300-review-artful-science-from-sunny-california-.html |author = Peter Turvey|volume = |work= [[New Scientist]] |date = 1992-02-15 |accessdate = 2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has an equally long history with musical, film and other performances. Participating artists and performers included [[Laurie Anderson]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Trimpin]], and [[The Mermen]].&lt;ref name=Speakingofmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of Music|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/40th/podcasts.php|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the artists in residence, the museum’s Osher Fellows Program hosts 4-8 resident scholars, scientists, educators, and artists every year. Notable Osher Fellows have included [[Walter Murch]], [[James Crutchfield]], [[Christian de Duve]], [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Tim Hunkin]], [[Lewis Hyde]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Rosamond Wolff Purcell]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], and [[Juan Felipe Herrera]].&lt;ref name=Osher&gt;{{cite web|title=Osher Fellows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hands-on activities for younger visitors (under 14 - needs confirmation).  The pendulum art activity has a youngster picking four different color markers.  The youngster then pushes a large board suspended by 4 wires to develop a pattern.  At the youngster's say so, the attendant places a selected color into an arm and lowers it onto a white paper weighted to the board.  The marker patterns the movement of the board. After 4 markers are done, the project is complete, signed by the 'young artist', and taken home.

==Influence==

===Impact===
In 2007, the Exploratorium was highlighted in the book ''Forces For Good'' as one of the 12 most effective non-profits in the United States, and was the only West Coast institution and only museum to make the list.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|last1=Crutchfield|first1=Leslie R.|last2=McLeod Grant|first2=Heather|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=978-0787986124|page=22}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has inspired science museums worldwide, from the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego to the [[Garden of Archimedes]] in Florence, Italy. In 2003, ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' noted that about 400 science centers in 43 countries were established after the example of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name=Pancaldi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Attendance===
In 2012, 570,000 people visited the Exploratorium; 55% were adults and 45% were children. Geographically, 52% were from the Bay Area, 24% from the rest of California, 14% from other states, and 10% outside the US. Some 36% received free or discounted admission, and 44,000 attended on free admission days. Prior to the relocation, 97,000 students and chaperons visited the museum each year; of these, 67,000 participated in the Field Trip program. It was estimated that 180 million people visited Exploratorium exhibits at science centers and other locations worldwide.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Annual attendance at the new Pier 15 location was anticipated to exceed one million.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Paul|title=New Exploratorium, with $300 million price tag, to open next week on San Francisco waterfront|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22982616/gleaming-new-300-million-exploratorium-open-next-wednesday?source=rss|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that although attendance had soared, revenues still fell short of goals, forcing the Exploratorium to lay off around 1/5 of its staff.&lt;ref name=ChangCutback&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Exploratorium Forced to Cut Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/science/exploratorium-forced-to-cut-back.html|accessdate=2014-05-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials had decided not to make a big publicity push upon reopening, fearing the overcrowding experienced by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, but this was later viewed as "an opportunity lost".&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt;  A staffer (expecting himself to be laid off) observed that the Exploratorium seemed to be "moving from visionary, internally developed work to work-for-hire for other museums around the world”, as the management scrambled to earn more money from consulting for other organizations to replace unrealized admissions revenue.&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt; On April 17, 2014 the Exploratorium announced that attendance in the first year since re-opening was 1.1 million visitors, and that other key statistics had doubled or tripled.&lt;ref name=Fact2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Slafkosky|first=Jenny|title=Fact Sheet: One Year at Pier 15|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/fact-sheet-one-year-pier-15|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
[[File:Exploratorium Webcast.jpg|thumb|right|''Solar Eclipse'' webcast at the old Exploratorium.]]
Online since 1993, the Exploratorium was one of the first museums to build a site on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Gnatek&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site serves 13 million visitors each year. It has received six [[Webby Award]]s since 1997, including four for Best Science Website and one for Best Education website, and has been an honoree an additional ten times.&lt;ref name=Webby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Webby Awards Gallery and Archive|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com|work=Webby Awards|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium's website is an extension of the experiences on the museum's floor and provides a large number of hands-on activities and exhibits for online-only visitors. The Exploratorium also broadcasts live video and/or audio directly from the museum floor (or from satellite feeds in the field, at such locations as Antarctica or the Belize rainforest) onto the Internet from its Webcast Studio. Webcasts provide access to special events, scientists, and other museum resources for audiences on the Web. Visitors to the website can hear or view interviews with scientists, "meet" interesting people, or tour unique locations from factories to particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=Semper&gt;

The Exploratorium has additionally released two free iPad apps, Sound Uncovered (2013) and Color Uncovered (2011), which assist in making its unique educational model as accessible as possible. Color Uncovered has been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref name=iPad&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Rebecca|title=Exploratorium’s new iPad app reveals ‘magic of existing phenomena’|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/exploratoriums-new-ipad-app-reveals-magic-of-existing-phenomena/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
The Exploratorium has a number of partnerships with other organizations. One notable current partnership is with the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  NOAA research vessels periodically berth at the end of Pier 15 and use the working biological labs featured in the museum to bring their research and data to the public. A number of exhibits at the Exploratorium, such as ''Remote Rains'', are based on NOAA data. NOAA scientists additionally provided training for the Explainer program to assist Explainers in explaining science to visitors based on the NOAA’s areas of research.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;

===Global Studios===
The Exploratorium Global Studios initiative is an entrepreneurial endeavor that shares resources, exhibits, and research with foreign governments, universities, partner museums, libraries, hospitals, and other public and private entities around the world. One area of significant current activity for the Global Studios initiative is the Middle East, where it hopes to assist countries that are making long-term investments in education and transitioning to more information-based economies.&lt;ref name=GlobalStudios&gt;{{cite press release |title=Exploratorium Launches Global Studios, an Entrepreneurial Endeavor to Share Knowledge and Services Around the World |language=English |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=The Exploratorium |location= |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-launches-global-studios-entrepreneurial-endeavor-share |accessdate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tinkering Studio visited a science festival in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2012, where they trained a group of teachers to help thousands of festival participants to experience the hands-on learning style favored by the Exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;

==Visiting the museum==
[[File:Wave Organ 2.jpg|thumb|''Wave Organ'' is an off-site Exploratorium exhibit]]

===Hours and access===
The Exploratorium is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am-5pm, with adults-only evening hours from 6pm-10pm on Thursdays (for visitors age 18+). The entire museum is wheelchair-accessible.

The Exploratorium is located on the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] at Green Street, between [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman’s Wharf]] and the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]]. The museum is accessible by multiple modes of public transit, including [[BART]], [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|Muni]] streetcar, bus, taxi, and [[pedicab]]. It is located {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} from the [[Embarcadero Station|Embarcadero]] BART and MUNI stations, and has its own stop on the [[F Market &amp; Wharves|F streetcar line]]. The Exploratorium does not own or operate any parking lots, but is located near several publicly accessible lots and on-street parking, including a lot directly across the street, operated by the Port of San Francisco.

===Events===
[[Pi Day|Community π Day]] started at the Exploratorium by [[Larry Shaw (Pi)|Larry Shaw]] and is celebrated annually on 3/14 (March 14). [[Iron Science Teacher]] competition (like [[Iron Chef]]) showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient. Monthly events include "Full-Spectrum Science with Ron Hipschman". Every Thursday is "After Dark" for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar|title=Upcoming Events Calendar {{!}} Exploratorium|date=2014-03-17|work=Exploratorium|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related points of interest===
The Exploratorium maintains exhibits in public Bay Area spaces. The Outdoor Exploratorium consists of 14 different exhibits relating to the local environment, all placed outside in the [[Fort Mason]] area and accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name=FrogMom&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Exploratorium: Cool Science at Fort Mason|url=http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|date=12 March 2009|work=FrogMom|accessdate=20 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204459/http://frogmom.com/2009/03/outdoor-exploratorium-cool-science-at-fort-mason|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wave Organ]]'' is another notable public artwork of the Exploratorium. Created by former staff artist Peter Richards, this acoustic sculpture is situated on a point of land jutting into the San Francisco Bay not far from the Exploratorium’s original Palace of Fine Arts location.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Film semiotics''' is the [[semiotics]] of [[film]]; the study of signs as they pertain to film on a variety of levels.

== Early semioticians of film ==
*  [[Ricciotto Canudo]] – Italian writer working in the 1920s, identified “''language-like character of cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam"&gt;Stam, R., Burgoyne, R., &amp; Lewis, S. (1992). New vocabularies in film semiotics: structuralism, post-structuralism, and beyond. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis Delluc]] – French writer, working in the 1920s, wrote of the ability of film to transcend national language.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Vachel Lindsay]] – referred to film as “''hieroglyphic language''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Béla Balázs]] – Hungarian film theorist who wrote about language-like nature of film from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Russian formalism (1910s–1930s) ==

[[Yury Tynyanov]] was a Russian writer and literary critic. [[Boris Eichenbaum]] outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. (see: [[syntagmatic analysis]]) Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of [[paradigmatic analysis]]. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “''particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.''””  &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

Eichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. ''"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to “inner speech” and “image translations of linguistic tropes.''”" &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Structuralism and post-structuralism (1950s–present) ==
The film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when [[post-structuralist]] thinkers started to criticize [[structuralism]]. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “''contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
'''Denotation and connotation'''

Film communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it.  At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer.  Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions.  According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” &lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Christian|title=Film language: A semiotics of the cinema|date=1974|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance.  Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.&lt;ref name="Monaco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monaco|first1=James|title=How to read a film: the world of movies, media, and multimedia: language, history, theory.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative'''

Narrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story-world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt; As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots.

'''Tropes'''

Metonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it.  An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics for Beginners|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important and notable works ==
'''Umberto Eco’s ''Articulations of The Cinematic Code'' (1976)'''

Umberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pasolini as a starting point. Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “''Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.''” &lt;ref name="Eco" /&gt;

Triple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use [[kinesics]] to identify discrete units of time.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;Eco, U. (1970). Articulations of the Cinematic Code. Cinematics, 1(1), 590-605.&lt;/ref&gt; Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “''The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.''” &lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

'''Summary of codes'''&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

1. Perceptive codes

2. Codes of recognition

3. Codes of transmission

4. Tonal codes

5. Iconic codes (figures, signs and semes)

6. Iconographic codes

7. Codes of taste and sensibility

8. Rhetorical codes

9. Stylistic codes

10. Codes of the unconscious

'''Christian Metz’s ''Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema'' (1974''')

This collection of Metz’s writings on cinematographic problems was informed by insights from [[structural linguistics]].
“''The study of the cinema as an art – the study of cinematographic expressiveness – can therefore be conducted according to methods derived from linguistics...through its procedures of denotation, the cinema is a specific language''” &lt;ref&gt;Metz, C. (1974). Film language; a semiotics of the cinema. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, and Sandy Flitterman-Lewis’s ''New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Post-structuralism, and Beyond'' (1992)'''

This work highlighted film semiotics as a new tool in art criticism. The book provided an overview of previous thinkers and defined terms critical to semiotic film theory. “''This book is intended as a didactic introduction to the vocabulary of the field, not as a series of interventions in film theory''” &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part One ''The Origins of Semiotics'''''

Semiotics must be viewed through the broader context of the linguistic nature of contemporary thought.

"''The overarching meta-discipline of semiotics...can be seen as a local manifestation of a more widespread "linguistic turn," an attempt to reconceptualize the world "through" linguistics.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Two ''Cine-semiology'''''

Dealt with the cinematic sign, The Grand Syntagmatic, textual systems and analysis, semiotics of filmic sound, language in the cinema.

'''Part Three ''Film-narratology'''''

Taking cues from structuralism and [[Russian Formalism]], film narrative theory attempts to "''designate the basic structures of story processes and to define the aesthetic languages unique to film narrative discourse.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Four ''Psychoanalysis'''''

The relationship between human psyche and cinematic representation is explored. "''One of the aims, therefore, of psychoanalytic film theory is a systematic comparison of the cinema as a specific kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Five ''From realism to intertextuality'''''

Describes the evolution from an emphasis on realism in the 1950s to the [[intertextuality]] of the 1970s.

[[File:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|Railway wheel [[Train wheel#Flange|flange]] (left)&lt;br /&gt;Tram wheel flange (right)]]
[[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|[[Train wheel#Flange|Flanged]] [[Train wheel|railway wheel]]]]
A '''flange''' is an   external or internal [[Ridge (disambiguation)|ridge]], or [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] (lip), for [[Shear strength|strength]], as the flange of an [[iron]] [[Beam (structure)|beam]] such as an [[I-beam]] or a [[T-beam]]; or for attachment to another object, as the flange on the end of a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the [[lens mount]] of a [[camera]]; or for a flange of a [[Railroad car|rail car]] or [[tram]] [[train wheel|wheel]]. Thus  flanged wheels are wheels with a flange on one side to keep the wheels from running off the [[Rail profile|rails]]. The term "flange" is also used for a kind of tool used to form flanges.  [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|Pipes]] with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.

== Plumbing or piping ==
{{Main|plumbing|piping}}
[[File:SurreyFlange.JPG|thumb|right|Surrey flange]]

A flange can also be a plate or ring to form a rim at the end of a pipe when fastened to the pipe (for example, a [[closet flange]]). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing the end of a pipe. A flange joint is a connection of pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.

Although the word flange generally refers to the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting, many flanged plumbing fittings are themselves known as 'flanges':

Common flanges used in plumbing are the Surrey flange or Danzey flange, York flange, Sussex flange and Essex flange.
Surrey and York flanges fit to the top of the hot water tank allowing all the water to be taken without disturbance to the tank. They are often used to ensure an even flow of water to showers. An Essex flange requires a hole to be drilled in the side of the tank.

There is also a Warix flange which is the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the top of the flange and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female adapters so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.

A [[closet flange]] provides the mount for a [[toilet]].

== Pipe flanges ==
There are many different flange standards to be found worldwide. To allow easy functionality and interchangeability, these are designed to have standardised dimensions. Common world standards include ASA/ASME (USA), PN/DIN (European), BS10 (British/Australian), and JIS/KS (Japanese/Korean).  In the USA, ANSI stopped publishing B16.5 in 1996, and the standard is ASME B16.5 

In most cases these are interchangeable as most local standards have been aligned to ISO standards, however some local standards still differ (e.g. an ASME flange will not mate against an ISO flange). Further, many of the flanges in each standard are divided into "pressure classes", allowing flanges to be capable of taking different pressure ratings. Again these are not generally interchangeable (e.g. an ASME 150 will not mate with an ASME 300).&lt;ref name=B165&gt;ASME B16.5&lt;/ref&gt;

These pressure classes also have differing [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] ratings for different materials. Unique pressure classes for piping can also  be developed for a process plant or power generating station; these may be specific to the corporation, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, or the process plant owner.  The ASME pressure classes for Flat-Face flanges are Class 125 and Class 250.  The classes for Ring-Joint, Tongue &amp; Groove, and Raised-Face flanges are Class 150, Class 300, (Class 400 - unusual), Class 600, Class 900, Class 1500, and Class 2500.&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

The flange faces are also made to standardized dimensions and are typically "flat face", "raised face", "[[Groove (machining)|tongue and groove]]", or "[[Gland (engineering)|ring joint]]" styles, although other obscure styles are possible.

Flange designs are available as "[[Weld neck flange|weld neck]]", "slip-on", "lap joint", "socket weld", "[[Threaded pipe|threaded]]", and also "blind".&lt;ref name=B165 /&gt;

=== ASME standards (U.S.) ===
[[File:Flanschverbindung Gasleitung.jpg|thumb|300px|right|ASME type flange on a gas pipeline]]

Pipe flanges that are made to standards called out by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] B16.5 or ASME B16.47, and MSS SP-44. They are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. ASME B16.5 refers to [[nominal pipe size]]s (NPS) from ½" to 24". B16.47 covers NPSs from 26" to 60". Each specification further delineates flanges into [[pressure]] classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and  B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900.  However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]].  Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature.  For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 Flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM A105 Carbon Steel and temperatures below 100F).

The [[gasket]] type and [[Screw|bolt]] type are generally specified by the standard(s); however, sometimes the standards refer to the ASME [[Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]] (B&amp;PVC) for details (see ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 – Appendix 2). These flanges are recognized by ASME Pipe Codes such as ASME B31.1 Power Piping, and ASME B31.3 Process Piping.

Materials for flanges are usually under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, there are many "industry standard" flanges that in some circumstance may be used on ASME work.

The product range includes SORF, SOFF, BLRF, BLFF, WNRF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), WNFF (XS, XXS, STD &amp; Schedule 20, 40, 80), SWRF (XS &amp; STD), SWFF (XS &amp; STD), Threaded RF, Threaded FF &amp; LJ, with sizes from 1/2" to 16". The bolting material used for flange connection is [[Threaded rod|stud bolts]] mated with two nut (washer when required). In Petrochemical industries, ASTM A193 B7 STUD &amp; ASTM A193 B16 Stud Bolts are used as these have high tensile strength.

=== European Dimensions EN / DIN ===
Most countries in Europe mainly install flanges according to standard DIN EN 1092-1 (forged Stainless or Steel Flanges). Similar to the ASME flange standard, the EN 1092-1 standard has the basic flange forms, such as weld neck flange, blind flange, lapped flange, threaded Flange (Thread ISO7-1 instead of NPT), weld on collar, pressed collars, and adapter flange such as flange coupling GD pressfittings. The different forms of flanges within the EN 1092-1 (European Norm Euronorm) is indicated within the flange name through the type.

=== Other countries ===
Flanges in the rest of the world are manufactured according to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards for materials, pressure ratings, etc. to which local standards including [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]], [[British Standards|BS]].... have been aligned.

== Compact flanges ==
As the Compact flange size increase it becomes relatively increasingly heavy and complex resulting in high procurement, installation and maintenance costs.
Large flange diameters in particular are difficult to work with, and inevitably require more space and have a more challenging handling and installation procedure, particularly on remote installations such as oil rigs.

The principal design of the flange face includes two independent seals. The first seal is created by application of seal seating stress at the flange heel, but it is not straight forward to ensure the function of this seal.

Theoretically, the heel contact will be maintained for pressure values up to 1,8 times the flange rating at room temperature.

Theoretically, the flange also remains in contact along its outer circumference at the flange faces for all allowable load levels that it is designed for.

The main seal is the IX seal ring. The seal ring force is provided by the elastic stored energy in the stressed seal ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the seal ring inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.

The design aims at preventing exposure to oxygen and other corrosive agents. Thus, this prevents corrosion of the flange faces, the stressed length of the bolts and the seal ring. This however depends on the outer dust rim to remain in satisfactory contact and that the inside fluid is not corrosive in case of leaking into the bolt circle void.

=== Applications of compact flanges ===
The initial cost of the theoretical higher performance compact flange is inevitably higher than a regular flange due to the closer tolerances and significantly more sophisticated design and installation requirements.
By way of example, compact flanges are often used across the following applications: subsea oil and gas or riser, cold work and [[cryogenics]], gas injection, high temperature, and nuclear applications.

== Train wheels ==
{{Main|train wheel}}

Trains stay on their tracks primarily due to the conical geometry of their wheels. They also have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails, when the limits of the geometry based alignment are reached, e.g. due to some emergency or defect.

== Vacuum flanges ==
{{Main|vacuum flange}}
A vacuum flange is a flange at the end of a tube used to connect vacuum chambers, tubing and vacuum pumps to each other.

[[File:pdr-cbr-flange.jpg|thumb|right|Form factor of PDR and CBR flanges.]]

== Microwave ==
{{Main|Waveguide flange}}
In [[microwave]] [[telecommunication]]s, a flange is a type of cable joint which allows different types of [[waveguide]] to connect.

Several different [[waveguide flange|microwave RF flange]] types exist, such as CAR, CBR, OPC, PAR, PBJ, PBR, PDR, UAR, UBR, UDR, icp and UPX.

== Ski boots ==
[[File:Salomon Divine RS CF.JPG|thumb|right|The extensions at the toe and heel of this ski boot produce flanges used to clip into the ski bindings.]]

[[Ski boot]]s use flanges at the toe or heel to connect to the binding of the ski.  The size and shape for flanges on [[alpine skiing]] boots is standardized in ISO 5355. Traditional [[Telemark skiing|telemark]] and [[cross country skiing|cross country]] boots use the 75&amp;nbsp;mm Nordic Norm, but the toe flange is informally known as the "duckbill". New cross country bindings eliminate the flange entirely and use a steel bar embedded within the sole instead.

==Content==
In ''Foundations of Geopolitics'', Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and [[Atlanticism]] to lose its influence in [[Eurasia]] and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book declares that "the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians" has not ended and Russia remains "the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American revolution]]". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed "on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of [[Atlanticism]], strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow [[Liberalism|liberal]] values to dominate us."&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

The book states that "the maximum task [of the future] is the '[[Finlandization]]' of all of Europe".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In Europe:
* [[Germany]] should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. [[Kaliningrad oblast]] could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term "Moscow–Berlin axis".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[France]] should be encouraged to form a "Franco–German bloc" with Germany. Both countries have a "firm anti-Atlanticist tradition".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* The [[United Kingdom]] should be cut off from Europe.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Finland]] should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the [[Republic of Karelia]] and northern Finland will be "donated to [[Murmansk Oblast]]".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Estonia]] should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] should be given a "special status" in the Eurasian-Russian sphere.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Poland]] should be granted a "special status" in the Eurasian sphere.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Romania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], "[[Republika Srpska|Serbian Bosnia]]" and [[Greece]] – "[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] collectivist East" – will unite with "Moscow the [[Third Rome]]" and reject the "rational-individualistic West".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Ukraine]] should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is [[cordon sanitaire]], which would be inadmissible.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In the Middle East and Central Asia:
* The book stresses the "continental Russian–Islamic alliance" which lies "at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy". The alliance is based on the "traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization".
* [[Iran]] is a key ally. The book uses the term "Moscow–Tehran axis".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Armenia]] has a special role: It will serve as a "strategic base," and it is necessary to create "the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Erevan-Teheran". Armenians "are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Azerbaijan]] could be "split up" or given to Iran.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] should be dismembered. [[Abkhazia]] and "United Ossetia" (which includes Georgia's [[South Ossetia]]) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* Russia needs to create "geopolitical shocks" within [[Turkey]]. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including "the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]])" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

In Asia:
* [[China]], which represents a danger to Russia, "must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled".  Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking [[Tibet]]–[[Xinjiang]]–[[Mongolia]]–[[Manchuria]] as a security belt.&lt;ref name="HI01"/&gt; Russia should offer China help "in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia" as geopolitical compensation.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* Russia should manipulate [[Politics of Japan|Japanese politics]] by offering the [[Kuril Islands]] to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;
* [[Mongolia]] should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia.&lt;ref name="dunlop"/&gt;

The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: "the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S."

In the United States:
* Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support [[Isolationism|isolationist]] tendencies in American politics".&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.&lt;ref name="dunlop" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Hoover Institution]] senior fellow [[John B. Dunlop]] stated that "the impact of this intended 'Eurasianist' textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin period".&lt;ref name="HI01"/&gt;

Historian [[Timothy Snyder]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that ''Foundations of Geopolitics'' is influenced by the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], a proponent of a conservative international order whose work influenced the [[Nazis]]. He also noted Dugin's key role in forwarding the ideologies of [[Eurasianism]] and [[National Bolshevism]].&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/|title=Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|date=20 March 2014|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was described by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' as "one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia during the entire post-Soviet era", and "more sober than Dugin’s previous books, better argued, and shorn of occult references, numerology, traditionalism and other eccentric metaphysics".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, [[news.com.au]] said that the book "reads like a to-do list for Putin's behaviour on the world stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/1990s-manifesto-outlining-russias-plans-is-starting-to-come-true/news-story/343a27c71077b87668f1aa783d03032c|title=This is what Russian heavyweights wanted in the ‘90s|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[Internet]], G-HOU participants around the world request observations from an automated [[telescope]], download images from a large image [[archive]], and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing software, as described by Dr. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title = Image Processing for Educators in Global Hands-On Universe |last1 = Miller |first1 = J.

==About==
'''Global Hands-On Universe''' is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools ([[webcam]] system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil-friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |eprint=astro-ph/0109372 |title=Hands-On Universe: A Global Program for Education and Public Outreach in Astronomy |author1= Boer |author2= Pack |author3= Pennypacker |author4= Melchior |author5= Faye |author6= Ebisuzaki |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP.

GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development.

In [[Europe]], the EU-HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet &amp; Dr A.-L. Melchior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2006IAUSS...2E...3F |title=Hands-on Universe - Europe|journal=IAU Special Session|volume=2|pages=3|author1=Ferlet|first1=R.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU-HOU has been funded through the [[European Community]] (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through  the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous  (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's [http://www.euhou.net website]. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/salsaj-software-mainmenu-9 SalsaJ] software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project "Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes. Every operation can be performed from the [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/ Web interface], available in 17 different languages, which enables the learners to reconstruct the rotation curve of the Milky Way as well as its spiral arms. Pedagogical resources (teacher's manual, [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/simu.php simulator of observation], [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/archive.php archives], [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/exercises-mainmenu-13/radio/352-pedagogical-material kinesthetic activities]) have been tested in teacher's training, secondary school level and also at undergraduate level.

In [[United States|America]], the US HOU project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 1996AAS...189.3004A |title=Hands-On Universe: Meaningful Astronomical Research in the Classroom |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=28|pages=1311 |date=1996|author1=Asbell-Clarke |first1=J. |last2=Barclay |first2=T. |last3=Deustua |first3=S. |last4=Gordon |first4=S. |last5=Marshall |first5=A. |last6=Pennypacker |first6=C. |last7=Refling |first7=J. |last8=Hoette |first8=V. |last9=Lohman |first9=R. |last10=Morin |first10=T. |last11=Pack |first11=H. |last12=Rodriguez |first12=B. |last13=Spuck |first13=T. |last14=Toler |first14=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is led by the United States with support from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their  data. [[High school]] [[curriculum]] developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at [[University of California, Berkeley]], is the educational center for the HOU project.

In [[Asia]], the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites.

In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2008cosp...37.2272O |title=Hands-on Universe |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly|volume=37 |page=E2|id=PE2-0011-08|author1=Oduori |first1=Susan |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education.

== Teacher training sessions ==

In the context of the European Commission [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]] in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, [http://ec.europa.eu/education/trainingdatabase/index.cfm?fuseaction=DisplayCourse&amp;cid=34183 FR-2013-408-003]).

The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia ([[Proprioception]]) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies - ICT. Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. '''The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in [[Information and communication technologies in education]] (ICT), maths and physics area'''.

These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies ([[Comenius programme]]). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/training-sessions-mainmenu-184 EU-HOU] Website and its [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/news-mainmenu-49 news].

A dedicated [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/forum/index forum]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community.

== History ==
Founded in [[Silicon Valley]] in 2003 by Paul J.J. Payack, the GLM describes its role as "a media analytics company that documents, analyzes and tracks cultural trends in language the world over, with a particular emphasis upon Global English".  GLM's main services include various products based on the Narrative Tracker technologies for global Internet and social media analysis. NarrativeTracker is based on global discourse, providing a real-time, accurate picture about any topic, at any point in time. NarrativeTracker analyzes the Internet, blogosphere, the top 275,000 print and electronic global media, as well as new social media sources as they emerge.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web|work=The Times |location=  London |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com |title=Global Language Monitor |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, GLM moved its headquarters from [[San Diego]] to [[Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;s_dispstring=%22global%20language%20monitor%22&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22global%20language%20monitor%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no] / Finally, California sends a business we can support&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary from Global Language Monitor About the 2017 edition of its annual fashion capital rankings===
The current 2017 rankings now include 63 fashion capitals.  There are three new fashion capitals from West Africa:  Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; and Lagos, Nigeria.  There is one new fashion capital from East Asia: Kuala Lumpur.  There is one new fashion capital from the Middle East:  Beirut, Lebanon.  Before the various insurgencies in the region,  Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East.   There are two new fashion capitals from North America:  Portland, Oregon known for its ‘weird’ culture, much like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio known in the fashion world as the manufacturing headquarters of Henri Bendel, Victoria’s Secret, the Bath &amp; Body Works, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A&amp;F), and others.

====Commentary from Global Language Monitor individual cities in the 2017 edition====

No. 3 Barcelona — Moving into Big Four Territory is Big News by definition.

No. 4 Milano — Reclaiming its Big Four status; hmm, perhaps all that re-thinking and revamping just might be having an impact (we’ll see in 2018).

No. 6 London — Had a great run earlier in the decade, but not so great lately (If you consider the No. 6 spot not so great).

No. 7 Amsterdam — Moving up 15 spots is quite a move.

No. 9 Vegas — Back in the Top Ten, more evidence that the Red Carpet experience does indeed have an impact.

No. 10 Dubai — More evidence that billions of dollars Do, indeed, have an impact.

No. 17 Seoul — Finally making the move in Asia, not No. 1, but a respectable No. 3 regionally.

No. 21 Washington, DC — A move into respectability!?

No. 28 Melbourne and No. 34 Sydney — Trading Places

No. 44 Portland, OR — A very nice debut.

No. 47 Kuala Lumpur — Another solid debut.

No. 46 Boston, No. 48 Miami, No.53 Chicago, No. 54 Houston, and No. 59 Toronto — All down by twenty spots, or more.

No. 63  Caracas — On Hiatus due to Insurrection.

Methodology: For this analysis, the Global Language Monitor used its proprietary Brand Affiliation Index (BAI), the same technology used to measure global brand equity for the Olympics, World Cup, the Fortune 500, and others. This exclusive, GLM longitudinal-study encompasses the prior three years to better assess short-term velocity and longer-term momentum. The study is a Big Data textual analysis based on billions of webpages, millions of blogs, the top 375,000 global print and electronic media, and new social media formats as they appear. This is the eleventh edition of the survey, which was first made public in 2007.

== High tech terms ==

On March 29, 2013 announced The Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the Second Decade of the 21st century, thus far (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) with commentary follow:

2013 Rank, Buzzword, Last Year’s rank

# Big Data (1) — Soon Human Knowledge will be doubling every second.  ’Big’ does not begin to describe what’s coming at us. 
# Dark Data (New)- Might not have noticed it because … it is ‘Dark Data’   ‘Big Data’ has begun to spin off its own superlatives.
# The Cloud (2) — All that data has got to go somewhere.  Hint:  it’s neither your phone nor your tablet.
# Yottabytes (New) – Showing up on lots of technologists’ radar lately:  a quadrillion gigabytes.
# The Next Big Thing (3) — A cliché rendered ever more meaningless but still on everyone’s tongue.
# Heisenbug (New) – A bug that disappears when you try to detect it, finally making the list after a steady ascent over the last decade.
# 3-D Printer (New) – Watch this space.  This technology has been used in CAD design for years and science fiction for decades — but now they are impinging upon everyday life. 
# Phablet (New) – The Next Big Thing? The odds are against it since consumer goods tend to evolve into single-purpose appliances.
# REST (New) – Representational State transfer is slowly climbing its way up the list.
# Web X.0 (5) — Formerly Web 2.0, 3.0, etc.

The study was released in conjunction with [[Austin]]'s [[South by Southwest]] Interactive festival.

On March 17, 2010, the Global Language Monitor presented the Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the first decade of the 21st century (2000–2009).&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Business-Intelligence/Most-Confusing-Tech-Buzzwords-824874/ Most Confusing Tech Buzzwords&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[HTTP]] — HyperText Transfer Protocol is used for [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language) files. 
# Flash — As in [[Flash Memory]].  "Flash’  is easier to say than " I brought the report on my EEPROM chip with a thin oxide layer separating a floating gate and control gate utilizing Fowler-Nordheim electron tunneling".
# God Particle – The [[Higgs boson]], thought to account for mass.  The God Particle has eluded discovery since its existence was first postulated some thirty years ago.
# Cloud computing – Distributing or accessing programs and services across the [[Internet]]. (The Internet is represented as a cloud.)
# [[Plasma display|Plasma]] (as in plasma TV) — Refers to a kind of television screen technology that uses matrix of gas plasma cells, which are charged by differing electrical voltages to create an image.
# [[IPOD]] – Apple maintains that the idea of the iPod was from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.  
# [[Megapixel]] – One million pixels or picture elements.
# Nano – Widely used to describe anything small as in [[nanotechnology]]. Like the word ‘mini’ which originally referred to the red hues in Italian miniature paintings, the word nano- is ultimately derived from the ancient Greek word for ‘dwarf’.
# Resonate – Not the tendency of a system to oscillate at maximum amplitude, but the ability to relate to (or resonate with) a customer’s desires.
# Virtualization – Around since the late ‘70s, virtualization now applies to everything from infrastructures to I/O.

On November 19, 2008 Global Language Monitor announced the most confusing yet frequently cited [[high tech]] [[buzzwords]] of 2008 to be cloud computing, [[green washing]], and [[buzzword]] compliant followed by resonate, de-duping, and virtualization.  Rounding out the Top Ten were [[Web 2.0]], [[Version control|versioning]], [[word clouds]], and [[petaflop]].  The most confusing Acronym for 2008 was [[SaaS]] (software as a service).

On 14 October 2007 GLM released a list of the most confusing high tech terms and buzzwords. The words included:
&lt;!-- This list formatted here for convenience does not publicly show up in rows, nor is it meant to. --&gt;
''[[iPod]]'',
''[[Adobe Flash|flash]]'',
''[[HTTP cookie|cookie]]'',
''nano'' and
''[[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]'',
followed by
''[[Hertz|megahertz]]'',
''[[cell (microprocessor)|cell]]''
(as in
''[[Mobile phone|cell phone]]''),
''[[plasma (physics)|plasma]]'',
''[[wiktionary:de-duplication|de-duplication]]''
and
''[[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-Ray]]''.
Other terms being tracked included
''[[terabyte]]'',
''[[Computer data storage|memory]]'',
''[[Magnetic core memory|core]]'',
and ''[[head crash]]''.
The most confusing acronym was found to be [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]], for service-oriented architecture, an acronym which [[IBM]] published a book about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=996 |title=Hooray! ‘SOA’ voted most ‘confusing acronym of the year’ &amp;#124; Service-Oriented Architecture &amp;#124; ZDNet.com |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The studies were released each year on the anniversary of the ''cookie,'' the invention that made the [[World Wide Web]] practical for widespread surfing, communication, and [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=2968.php |title=The Global Language Monitor releases global study of top 10 most confusing yet widely used high tech buzzwords for 2007 |publisher=Nanowerk.com |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Times]] quoted Paul JJ Payack as saying that the PQI is "an algorithm that tracks words and phrases in the media and on the Internet in relation to frequency, context and appearance in global media.  It is a weighted index that takes into account year-to-year increases and acceleration in the last several months".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/realestate/29cov.html The Power of Words]&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, GLM describes its Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI), used to run its analytics on global language trends and, as a weighted index, factoring in long-term trends, short-term changes, momentum and velocity, using frequency data on words and phrases in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet, and throughout the [[blogosphere]], as well as in proprietary databases ([[Factiva]], [[Lexis-Nexis]], etc.). It can also create "signals" that can be used in a variety of applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagemonitor.com/predictive-quantities-indicator/pqi/  The Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI)], GLM website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obama an English language word ==
On 20 February 2008 GLM announced that the latest word to enter the English language was "obama", derived from Barack Obama, in its many variations.  GLM described Obama- as a "root" for words including obamanomics, obamican, obamamentum, obamacize, obamarama, obamaNation, Obamafy, obamamania and obamacam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1579436/English-language-is-Barack-%27Obamafied%27.html English language is Barack 'Obamafied'], Catherine Elsworth, Los Angeles, Telegraph.co.uk, 26 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt; GLM announced it to be an accepted word, once it met the group's published criteria: a minimum of 25,000 citations in the global media, as well as achieving the necessary 'breadth' and 'depth' of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/predictive-quantities-indicator/pqi// |title='PQI' |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical sign of gonadarche, and usually of [[puberty]].

Gonadarche should be contrasted with [[adrenarche]]. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2115">'''Heterotrophic nutrition''' is the mode of nutrition in which organisms depend upon other organisms to survive. 
All animals and non green plants are heterotrophic.

Heterotrophic organisms have to acquire and take in all the organic substances they need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p101.pdf Heterotrophic nutrition and control of bacterial density]&lt;/ref&gt;

All heterotrophs (except blood and gut [[parasite]]s) have to convert solid food into soluble compounds capable of being absorbed (digestion).Then the soluble products of digestion for the organism are being broken down for the release of energy (respiration). All heterotrophs depend on [[Autotroph|autotrophs]] for their nutrition. Heterotrophic plants have only four types.

The four main types of heterotrophic nutrition are: 
#[[Holozoic nutrition]]: the word holozoic is made from two words- holo= whole and zoikos= animals and literally means animals which eat their food whole. Complex food is taken into a specialist digestive system and broken down into small pieces to be absorbed. This consists of 5 stages, [[ingestion]], [[digestion]], [[Absorption (small intestine)|absorption]], [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[egestion]]. E.g.: human 
#[[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprobiontic]]/[[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]] nutrition: Organisms feed on dead organic remains of other organisms. E.g.: decomposers
#[[Parasitism|Parasitic nutrition]]: Organisms obtain food from other living organisms (the host), with the host receiving no benefit from the parasite.When a parasite is present inside the body of the host, it is known as an endoparasite. These parasites suck and feed on the blood of the host.  E.g.: tapeworms
#[[Symbiosis|Symbiotic nutrition]]:Two organisms live in close association to benefit each other or one of the two benefits the other whilst it itself suffers neither loss but nor does it gain.  E.g.: fungi and algae, rizobium and leguminous plants roots.

'''Human furniture''' is [[furniture]] in which a person's body is used as a tray, foot stool, chair, table, cabinet or other item. '''Forniphilia''' is the practice of creating human furniture. Examples of human furniture have appeared in [[modern art]] and in [[pornography]].

==Art==
A model used as human furniture may be nude or semi-nude to add to the [[Eroticism|erotic]] or aesthetic appeal. [[Allen Jones (artist)|Allen Jones']] sculptures [[Hatstand, Table and Chair|''Hatstand'', ''Table'' and ''Chair'']], made in 1969, which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, is a classic example of the depiction of forniphilia as art.&lt;ref name="turned down stanley"&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin Gayford |title =Allen Jones: The day I turned down Stanley Kubrick |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |place=London |date=8 October 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3668398/Allen-Jones-The-day-I-turned-down-Stanley-Kubrick.html |accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bondage==
The term ''forniphilia'' was coined by [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] artist [[Jeff Gord]]&lt;ref name="Jeff Gord Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialkink.com/articles.php?do=view&amp;id=92 |title=Jeff Gord Interview |publisher= |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422130006/http://socialkink.com/articles.php?do=view&amp;id=92 |archivedate=22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hames&gt;[[Ashley Hames]], ''Sin Cities'', Tonto Books, 2008, {{ISBN|0-9556326-0-9}}, pp. 184–188&lt;/ref&gt; who specialized in the subgenre and maintained the website "House of Gord" on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literary / Liberal Entanglements: Toward a Literary History for the Twenty-First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4E0DwAAQBAJ|first1=Corrinne|last1=Harol|first2=Mark|last2=Simpson|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2017|isbn=9781442630901|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forniphilia as a form of bondage usually involves the subject being tightly bound and expected to stay immobile for a prolonged period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-toi/The-kinks-of-virtual-men/articleshow/1911674.cms | title=The kinks of virtual men | date=15 April 2007 | journal=[[The Times of India]] | accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often gagged (see [[forniphilic gag]]) and/or placed in position where there is a danger of being [[smother]]ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7821">The '''infill wall''' is the supported [[wall]] that closes the perimeter of a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure (generally made of [[steel]] or [[reinforced concrete]]). Therefore, the structural frame ensures the bearing function, whereas the infill wall serves to separate inner and outer space, filling up the boxes of the outer frames. The infill wall has the unique static function to bear its own weight. The infill wall is an external vertical opaque type of closure. With respect to other categories of wall, the infill wall differs from the partition that serves to separate two interior spaces, yet also non-load bearing, and from the load bearing wall. The latter performs the same functions of the infill wall, hygro-thermically and acoustically, but performs static functions too.

The use of [[masonry]] infill walls, and to some extent veneer walls, especially in [[reinforced concrete]] frame structures, is common in many countries. In fact, the use of masonry infill walls offers an economical and durable solution. They are easy to build, attractive for architecture and has a very efficient cost-performance.

Today, masonry enclosures and partition walls are mainly made of clay units, but also aggregate concrete units (dense and lightweight aggregate) and autoclaved aerated concrete units are used. More recently, industry is also trying to introduce wood concrete blocks. Partition walls, made with both vertically and horizontally perforated clay blocks, represent two third of the corresponding market.

== Requirements for enclosure systems==
Masonry enclosure walls systems, must meet some structural and non-structural requirements.&lt;ref&gt;''D3.1 Report on types of structural frames, related enclosure wall systems, and requirements for the construction systems'', INSYSME, Innovative Systems for Earthquake Resistant Masonry Enclosures in RC buildings, contract n° 606229, www.insysme.eu.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural ===
The requirements relating structural stability are currently defined and regulated by Eurocode 6 for load bearing masonry structures and by Eurocode 8 for seismic safety. These codes impose requirements for masonry walls, particularly non-collapse (in-plane/out of plane) and damage limitation, providing methods of calculation to ensure these two requirements. 
Some of the non-structural requirements are: [[fire safety]], [[thermal comfort]], acoustic comfort, [[wikt: durability| durability]] and [[water leakage]].

=== Fire safety ===
The safety against fire is one of the requirements that is often required to enclosures walls. However, as usually the more traditionally used materials (blocks, bricks and mortar) are not fuel products, it is relatively easy to achieve the requirements relating to the limitation of spread of fire, thermal insulation and structural strength, which in severe cases, must be guaranteed for 180 minutes.

=== Thermal comfort ===
The thermal comfort is a requirement that the enclosure walls must comply. This requirement has a direct influence on the construction of the walls. The thermal regulations are demanding increasingly higher values of thermal resistance to the walls. To meet these demands new products and building systems, which ensure that the thermal resistances requested by the regulations will be provided, are developed. It is likely that in the near future traditional construction solutions with double leaf walls (with new, more thermally efficient bricks and blocks) will be adapted, and there will be increased use of thermal insulation systems for exterior (ETICS), such as use of single leaf walls. Also the use of insulation systems from the inside will increase. The development of new enclosure wall systems should, apart from trying to improve requisites relating to structural stability in case of earthquake, improve the thermal resistance of the solution.

===Durability and waterproofing===
To ensure durability and waterproofing, the most important thing is to avoid errors in design and construction, leading to the appearance of (structural and non-structural) pathologies. Some requisites that the walls must have in order to avoid pathologies are: adequate expansion joints, correct support of the walls in the correction of thermal bridges, appropriate clipping between masonry leafs, correct implementation of space between leafs, proper placement of thermal insulation. The proper use of paints, protection against moisture and the correct preparation and application of traditional plasters, among others, are important factors

==Interaction between buildings and masonry infills==

===Global behaviour===
When there is a perimeter contact between the masonry infill walls and the frame, in ordinary situations of adherent robust infill walls, the effect of stiffness increase (and also dissipation) influences the building response. In the case of infill walls built disconnected from the structure (not in adherence with the frame elements), it is likely that infill walls act as an additional mass applied to the structure only, and should not have other significant effects.
&lt;br /&gt;In general, in the most frequent case of perimeter contact between the masonry panels and the beams and columns of the RC structure, the infill panels interact with the structure, regardless of the lateral resistance capacity of the structure, and act like structural elements, overtaking lateral loads until they are badly damaged or destroyed. In this case, the most important effects of the structure-infill interaction are:
* Increased lateral rigidity of the structure; in the case of flexible structures from seismic zones with small values of the period Tc, the seismic forces increase over the normal level;  
* Creating some vertical irregularities by increasing the ductility demand at one storey, or creating some horizontal irregularities by increasing the ensemble torsion as a result of modifying the centre of rigidity; for the design of buildings in seismic zones, these situations must be always avoided;  
* Creating some solicitations of short elements type, having a risk of rupture to shear force, due to the fact that on the deformable zone of the column the shear force is substantially larger than in the normal case (also treated as local effect).

===Local behavior===
The main problems in the local interaction between frame and infill are the formation of short beam, short column effect in the structural elements. The zones in which supplementary shear forces can occur, acting locally on the extremities of the beams and columns, should be dimensioned and transversally reinforced in order to overtake safely these forces.

==Infill wall types==

===Single-leaf wall===
A wall without a cavity or continuous vertical joint in its plane.&lt;ref&gt;''EN 1996-1-1:2005'', Eurocode 6 - Design of masonry structures. Part 1-1: General rules for reinforced and unreinforced masonry structures, European Committee for Standardization.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cavity wall ===
{{main|Cavity wall}}
A wall consisting of two parallel single-leaf walls, effectively tied together with wall ties or bed joint reinforcement. The space between the leaves is left as a continuous cavity or filled or partially filled with non-loadbearing thermal insulating material. A wall consisting of two leaves separated by a cavity, where one of the leaves is not contributing to the strength or stiffness of the other (possibly loadbearing) leaf, is to be regarded as a veneer wall.

===Veneer wall ===
{{main|Masonry veneer}}
A wall used as a facing but not bonded or contributing to the strength of the backing wall or framed structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10801">{{Disability}}
In the U.S. the '''[[Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)]]''' is a special education law that mandates regulation for students with disabilities in order to protect their rights as students and the rights of their parents. Under this act it is required that all students receive a '''[[Free Appropriate Public Education|Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)]]''', and includes that these students should be educated in the '''least restrictive environment (LRE)''' . The least restrictive environment clause states that students with disabilities should be educated with students without disabilities to the maximum appropriate extent&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Stephen|last2=Rapport|first2=Mary Jane|title=Least restrictive environment: Understanding the direction of the courts|journal=Proquest|date=1998|volume=32|issue=2|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.bu.edu/docview/1839933068?accountid=9676&amp;rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If a student should require supplementary aids and services necessary (such as an interpreter, resource room or itinerant teacher) to achieve educational goals while being placed in a classroom with students without disabilities, they should be provided as needed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Should the nature or severity of their disability prevent the student from achieving these goals in a regular education setting, the student would be withdrawn from the regular education setting and be placed in an alternate environment that is more suitable for the student.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Schools and public agencies are required to have a continuum of alternative placements for students with disabilities. These alternate placements include but are not limited to special classes, hospital and institutions, and home school. This is to ensure that schools are capable of meeting the needs of all students with disabilities. This continuum of placements is not always full inclusion or complete separate schooling, but can be a mix of both regular education classes and other alternate placements&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/b/300.115|title=Sec.  300.115 Continuum of alternative placements {{!}} Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|website=sites.ed.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

To determine what an appropriate setting is for a student, an '''[[Individualized Education Program|Individualized Education Plan (IEP)]]''' team will review the student’s strengths, weaknesses, and needs, and consider the educational benefits from placement in any particular educational setting. By law the team is required to include the student's parent or guardian, a general education teacher, a special education teacher, a representative of the local education agency, someone to interpret evaluation results and if appropriate the student. It is the IEP team's responsibility to determine what environment is the LRE for any given student with disabilities, which varies between every student&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.bu.edu/docview/1753917861?accountid=9676|title=How individualized education plan team members determine least restrictive environment and educational placement|last=Bost|first=Julie|date=2015|website=Proquest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Court rulings==

Because the law does not clearly state to what degree the least restrictive environment is, courts have had to interpret the LRE principle.  In a landmark case interpreting IDEA's predecessor statute (EHA), ''Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education'' (1989), it was determined that students with disabilities have a right to be included in both academic and extracurricular programs of general education.  But, the Court stated, IDEA does not contemplate an all-or-nothing educational system in which children with disabilities attend either regular or special education. Rather, the Act and its regulations require schools to offer a continuum of services. Thus, the school must take intermediate steps where appropriate, such as placing the child in regular education for some academic classes and in special education for others, mainstreaming the child for nonacademic classes only, or providing interaction with non-disabled children during lunch and recess. The appropriate mix will vary from child to child and, it may be hoped, from school year to school year as the child develops. If the school officials have provided the maximum appropriate exposure to non-disabled students, they have fulfilled their obligation under IDEA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/874/1036/382507/ Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ.], 874 F.2d 1036, 1050 (5th Cir.1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Board of Education, Sacramento City Unified School District v. Rachel H., 14 F.3d 1398 (9th Cir. 1994), four factors were identified as things needed to be taken into consideration when determining if the student’s LRE is appropriate.  They are:

* the educational benefits of integrated settings versus segregated settings,
* nonacademic benefits (primarily social interaction with non-disabled peers),
* the effect the student with a disability can have on the teacher and their peers, and
* the cost of supplementary services that will be required for that student to stay in the integrated setting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/b/300.114|title=Sec. 300.114 LRE requirements|last=|first=|date=|website=IDEA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply stated, the student should receive an appropriate version of the educational and social benefits which non-disabled students routinely receive in school.  In broad theory, the court does not allow the education of the student’s non-disabled peers to be negatively affected, although applying this test fairly to all the facts and circumstances of a specific situation may be very difficult.  The final factor, cost of supplementary services, provides a safeguard for schools so that they do not exceed spending on one particular student.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Least restrictive environment for the Deaf ==
The '''least restrictive environment''' states that students should be able to be educated in an environment with "non-disabled peers." However in the case of Deaf students there are many cases where a mainstream classroom may not be the most inclusive, or least restrictive, environment. The NAD (National Association of the Deaf) believes that the '''least restrictive environment''' for the Deaf is an environment that promotes a child's social, cognitive and emotional development with the least amount of communication and language barriers&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Position Statement on Inclusion|url=https://www.nad.org/about-us/position-statements/position-statement-on-inclusion/|website=National Association of The Deaf|publisher=National Association of The Deaf|accessdate=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In many cases the supposed '''least restrictive environment''' leads to (linked) language deprivation and subpar educational results, and an environment with all Deaf students and those certified to communicate with the Deaf has proven to be the truly least restricting environment.

There are some accommodations that can be made to make a mainstream school more appropriate for a deaf child such as: Interpreters, a Deaf program within a mainstream school with Deaf peers and language models present, CART services, etc. However, these are not always successful nor the best option for every deaf child. Deaf residential and day schools provide certain benefits such as, placing Deaf students into classrooms with kids their own age, amount of hearing loss and with staff that are certified to work the deaf, that the typical LRE would not hold. Not only do Deaf schools facilitate social interaction by bringing Deaf students and staff together, but also can have specialized education equipment and extracurricular activities that are made communicably accessible to the Deaf to help promote growth emotionally and cognitively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dubow|first1=Sy|title="Into the turbulent mainstream" - a legal perspective on the weight to be given to the least restrictive environment in placement decisions for deaf children|journal=HeinOnline|date=1989|volume=18|issue=2|page=219|url=http://heinonline.org.ezproxy.bu.edu/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/jle18&amp;page=215&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Benefits of the typical least restrictive environment for the Deaf ===
There are certain studies that have shown that the typical inclusion model for the Deaf has some benefits. A specific study found that a classroom with both hearing and Deaf and harding of hearing students actually helped improved signing development for the Deaf. It also showed improvement in certain testing scores such as reading vocabulary/comprehension and solving math problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreimeyer|first1=Kathryn|last2=Crooke|first2=Pamela|last3=Drye|first3=Cynthia|last4=Egbert|first4=Vivian|last5=Clein|first5=Barbara|title=Academic and Social Benefits of a Co-enrollment Model of Inclusive Education for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|date=2000-04-01|volume=5|issue=2|page=174-185|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.bu.edu/10.1093/deafed/5.2.174}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The NAD supports placement of Deaf and Hard of Hearing students in the regular education setting if the placement decision made was based on thorough evaluation of the student and their needs. They believe that the placement and resources provided for the student should be based on communication and that the IEP team making the decision should be fully educated on the issues related to sign language and the needs of the Deaf population&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Additionally, within the IDEA there is a subsection describing alternative appropriate school placements. Within this section special schools are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ed.gov/idea/regs/b/b/300.115|title=Sec. 300.115 Continuum of alternative placements|last=|first=|date=|website=IDEA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Horstman and Auzenne learned about podcasting in 2005 and decided that this could be a way to disseminate their knowledge about effective management.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Auzenne said he didn’t want to create a model where he would only give away half of a solution and then require the audience to pay for the rest of the solution.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"&gt;Mike Auzenne in: Manager Tools: Making Money from Podcasting article by David Spark on http://www.sparkminute.com/2009/09/29/manager-tools-making-money-from-podcasting/&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time.&lt;ref name="mtweb" /&gt; After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt; They regularly consult to and train managers in [[Fortune 1000]] companies around the world.&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;Career Tools Wins Business Category of People's Choice Podcast Awards http://www.eworldwire.com/pressreleases/211975&lt;/ref&gt; Their company also sells transcripts of the podcasts on-line through membership, and they organize public and in-company conferences to practice the Manager Tools.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"/&gt; As of 2012, the company has five full-time employees.

==Podcasts==
Most casts are about 30–40 minutes long, presented as a dialogue between the two hosts.&lt;ref name="smb"&gt;http://www.smbtrendwire.com/2008/01/07/podcast-review-manager-tools/ Review at Small Business Trends Radio (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a specific topic related to management or career development. Casts start with an overview of the points to be discussed, followed by the discussion point by point, and end with a summary of the points discussed.

Manager Tools main podcasts are available on the webpage and also through [[iTunes]] and [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;List of Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts&lt;/ref&gt; The podcasts often refer to each other which in the past has created issues with new listeners. In order to help them, a collection of 'basics' casts has been created and is available on their website as well.&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt; Those cover mostly 'The Management Trinity' as well as additional basic notions.

Manager Tools casts help ''90 percent of the people, 90 percent of the time''.&lt;ref&gt;Feedback From Your Directs - What To Say - Part 1 http://www.manager-tools.com/2012/04/feedback-your-directs-what-say-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; And the great majority of the casts are timeless instead of just timely.&lt;ref name="Newsletter"&gt;Mark Horstman, "Things I Think I Think" newsletter from 26 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Management]] is about doing the right things repeatedly. Successful managers do them over and over again; and is about '''Behaviors'''.&lt;ref&gt;One-on-Ones: The Single Most Effective Management Tool http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Podcast, you find many topics that helps on professional life. Such as: Behaviors ('''There are 5 Manager Tools behaviors'''),&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity - Feedback http://www.manager-tools.com/2008/03/the-management-trinity-feedback&lt;/ref&gt; career, communication, development, network, performance, strategy, team and many more. One of the Manager Tools motto is : "'''There's a cast for that'''".

*'''Manager Tools podcast''': ''Every Manager Effective''.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt;
*'''Career Tools podcast''': ''Every Professional Productive''.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt;

The Manager Tools '''"Basics"''' — is a special collection of podcasts on the essentials of effective managerial behavior and the base of all the Manager Tools advanced material.

The podcasts are often articulated around the 'Manager Tools Philosophy'.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Its main parts are ''''The Management Trinity'''' and the ''''Horstman's Laws''''. The founders focus on specific action steps that managers can apply to their job as opposed to theoretical management models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atkinsonadvisor.com/hits-bytes/www-manager-tool-com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The hosts also provide for a fee access to special set of podcasts with more specific themes and with more detailed information on those topics, covering among other:&lt;ref name="products"&gt;List of Manager Tools products https://www.manager-tools.com/products&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Content and theories==

===Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity===

The hosts often refers to the ''''Management Trinity'''':&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/01/positive-feedback-before-its-time&lt;/ref&gt; One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends.&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity http://www.manager-tools.com/2009/10/management-trinity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are ''Teachable Equivalents'' that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.

They usually include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics"&gt;List of Basic Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Managing Responsibilities http://www.ymresourcer.com/documents/Managing_Responsibilities.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
*One on Ones (Weekly meetings in order to reinforce relationships) - recognised as "the best business practice of all time" by profitguide.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profitguide.com/article/78170--the-30-best-business-practices-of-all-time&lt;/ref&gt; -
*Feedback (reinforcing or correcting behaviours)
*Coaching (Fostering Continuous Development)
*Delegation (Managerial Economics of who should do a task)

Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt;
* Running Effective Meetings
* Methods for rolling out the Manager Tools Trinity
* 'Solution to a Stalled Technical Career'

===DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report===
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the [[DISC assessment]] when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.

The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits ('''D'''ominance, '''I'''nfluence, '''S'''teadiness and '''C'''onscientious.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inscapepartners.com/discclassic/&lt;/ref&gt; These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[[DISC assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/hortsmans-laws-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/horstmans-laws-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* Horstman Curve (difficulty of growth at the beginning of a career)
* McGuire's Hump (regarding how hard it is to change)
* Horstman's Laws of Interviewing
* Horstman's Rule of Christmas
* The Wendii Curve (regarding Cultural Diversity)&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Podcast http://www.manager-tools.com/2010/02/managing-cultural-diversity-wendii-curve&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walt's Rule (regarding how and where spend time)&lt;ref name="fan" /&gt;
* Horstman’s Law of Managerial Friction: It’s always harder to start change than it is to sustain it.
* Horstman's Corollary to [[Parkinson's Law]] ("Work contracts to fit the time you give it")
* Horstman's definition of conflict: more than one person in the same county.

==Internationalisation==
Manager Tools, although slightly biased by US background, aims at creating timeless and universal content.&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Podcast Linkedin for Managers http://www.manager-tools.com/2010/04/linkedin-managers-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; They have listeners all over the world;&lt;ref name="eprint" /&gt; since 2009, some of the podcasts and knowledge have been adapted in French&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools France Launches! https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/manager-tools-france&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Community https://www.manager-tools.com/community&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools in french "Outils du Manager" http://www.outilsdumanager.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and, since 2010, was also in German for some time. Those adaptations have been started by enthusiastic listeners of the cast that are willing to invest their time to make the content available to a larger audience (Cedric Watine and his associate Lorry in the French version. Gernot Glawe was in the German version).

On 12 March 2012, Gernot Glawe, who had been hosting and maintaining the German version of the site, announced its closing by the end of March 2012 and thanked his listeners for the 116.000 downloads of his 68 podcasts.

As part of internationalization, Manager Tools conferences have been, besides [[United States]], in [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and in [[China]] ([[Shanghai]]).

[[File:Mangroves in Kannur, India.jpg|thumb|Mangroves are adapted to saline conditions]]

A '''mangrove''' is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal [[saline water|saline]] or [[brackish water]]. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species.  Mangroves occur worldwide in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]], mainly between latitudes [[25th parallel north|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;N]] and [[25th parallel south|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;S]]. The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was {{convert|137,800|km2}}, spanning 118 countries and territories.&lt;ref name="Giri2010"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2010 |title= Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data |journal= [[Global Ecology and Biogeography]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=154–159 |doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x |last1=Giri |first1=C. |last2=Ochieng |first2=E. |last3=Tieszen |first3=L.L. |last4=Zhu |first4=Z. |last5=Singh |first5=A. |last6=Loveland |first6=T. |last7=Masek |first7=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |last8=Duke |first8=N. |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/referata/arq/2010_09_Marilia/Giri_etal_2010.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called [[halophyte]]s, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex [[root]] system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud.

The word is used in at least three senses: (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or ''mangal'',&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth, Peter J. (1999) ''The Biology of Mangroves'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|0-19-850222-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2012}} for which the terms ''mangrove forest [[biome]]'', and ''mangrove swamp'' are also used, (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp, and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove [[Family (biology)|family]] of plants, the [[Rhizophoraceae]], or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus ''[[Rhizophora]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The mangrove biome, or mangal, is a distinct saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat characterized by [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure [[seawater]] (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the [[salinity]] of ocean seawater (up to 9%).&lt;ref name=NHMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |title=Morphological and Physiological Adaptations: Florida mangrove website |publisher=Nhmi.org |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204222702/http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathias /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "[[wikt:mangrove#English|mangrove]]" comes to English from Spanish (perhaps by way of Portuguese), and is likely to originate from [[Guaraní language|Guarani]]. It was earlier "mangrow" (from Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|mangue}}'' or Spanish ''{{lang|es|mangle}}''), but this word was corrupted via [[folk etymology]] influence of the word "[[Grove (nature)|grove]]".

==Ecology==
[[File:World map mangrove distribution.jpg|thumb|The world's mangrove forests in 2000]]
Mangrove swamps (mangals) are found in tropical and subtropical [[tidal]] areas. Areas where mangals occur include [[estuary|estuaries]] and marine shorelines.&lt;ref name=Mathias/&gt;

The [[intertidal]] existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.

At low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and desiccation, and are then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as a number of other key environmental factors—thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.

About 110 species are considered "mangroves", in the sense of being a tree that grows in such a saline swamp,&lt;ref name="Mathias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |title=Mangal (Mangrove). '&amp;#39;World Vegetation'&amp;#39;. Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, University of California at Los Angeles |publisher=Botgard.ucla.edu |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209010910/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, ''Rhizophora''. However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species.

Mangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], high [[salinity]] and frequent tidal [[inundation]]. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, [[Rhizophora|mangrove tree species]] show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal inundation and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as [[predation]] of plant seedlings by crabs.

Once established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of [[Heavy metals|heavy (trace) metals]] which [[colloidal particle]]s in the sediments have scavenged from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during [[hurricanes]]), and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Mazda|first1=Y.|last2=Kobashi|first2=D.|last3=Okada|first3=S.|year=2005|title=Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps|url=|journal=Wetlands Ecology and Management | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 647–655 | doi=10.1007/s11273-005-0613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118387 |pmid=16254180 |title=The Asian Tsunami: A Protective Role for Coastal Vegetation |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=643 |year=2005 |last1=Danielsen |first1=F |last2=Sørensen |first2=M.

Mangrove swamps' effectiveness in terms of erosion control can sometimes be overstated.

Mangrove plantations in [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[India]] host several commercially important species of fishes and crustaceans. Despite restoration efforts, developers and others have removed over half of the world's mangroves in recent times.

Mangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of [[termite]]s.  It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary and tectonic conditions.&lt;ref name="Vane"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ggge.20194 |title=Degradation of mangrove tissues by arboreal termites (Nasutitermes acajutlae) and their role in the mangrove C cycle (Puerto Rico): Chemical characterization and organic matter provenance using bulk δ13C, C/N, alkaline CuO oxidation-GC/MS, and solid-state |journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=3176 |year=2013 |last1=Vane |first1=Christopher H |last2=Kim |first2=Alexander W |last3=Moss-Hayes |first3=Vicky |last4=Snape |first4=Colin E |last5=Diaz |first5=Miguel Castro |last6=Khan |first6=Nicole S |last7=Engelhart |first7=Simon E |last8=Horton |first8=Benjamin P |bibcode=2013GGG....14.3176V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangrove involved. In Puerto Rico the red ([[Rhizophora mangle]]), white ([[Laguncularia racemosa]]) and black ([[Avicennia germinans]]) mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions so the carbon content varies between the species as well between the different tissues of the plant e.g. leaf matter vs roots.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In Puerto Rico there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by red mangroves to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores.&lt;ref name="versteegh"&gt;Versteegh, G. J. M., et al. (2004). "Taraxerol and Rhizophora pollen as proxies for tracking past mangrove ecosystems." Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 68(3): 411–422.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In order to understand peat formation by mangroves, it is important to understand the conditions they grew in, and how they decayed.  Termites are an important part of this decay, and so an understanding of their action on the organic matter is crucial to the chemical stabilization of mangrove peats.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

Mangroves are an important source of [[blue carbon]]. Globally, mangroves stored 4.19 Pg of carbon in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart E.|last2=Friess|first2=Daniel A.|date=2018-02-26|title=Global carbon stocks and potential emissions due to mangrove deforestation from 2000 to 2012|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0090-4|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=8|issue=3|pages=240–244|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0090-4|issn=1758-678X|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..240H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of 316,996,250 t of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Biology==
Of the recognized 110 mangrove species, only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 [[Family (biology)|families]] constitute the "true mangroves", species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats.&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Demonstrating [[convergent evolution]], many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), [[Anaerobic environment|anaerobic]] soils and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangrove.&lt;ref name="Mathias" /&gt; The greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of [[New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity/ |title=Distribution of coral, mangrove and seagrass diversity |publisher=Maps.grida.no |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305202831/http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations to low oxygen===
[[File:Mangrove.jpg|thumb|A red mangrove, ''Rhizophora mangle''.]]
[[File:Mangroves.jpg|thumb|Above and below water view at the edge of the mangal.]]
[[Rhizophora mangle|Red mangroves]], which can survive in the most inundated areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark ([[lenticel]]s). [[Avicennia germinans|Black mangroves]] live on higher ground and make many [[pneumatophore]]s (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in [[lenticel]]s.

These "breathing tubes" typically reach heights of up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and in some species, over 3 m. The four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type, snorkel or peg type, knee type, and ribbon or plank type. Knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots at the base of the tree. The roots also contain wide [[aerenchyma]] to facilitate transport within the plants.

===Limiting salt intake===
[[File:Saltcrystals on avicennia marina var resinifera leaves.JPG|thumb|Salt crystals formed on grey mangrove leaf.]]
Red mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly [[suberin|suberised]] (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultra-filtration mechanism to exclude [[sodium]] [[salts]] from the rest of the plant. Analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded at the roots. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the "sacrificial leaf", salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research suggests the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=L. Joseph |year=2010 |title=Sacrificial leaf hypothesis of mangroves |url=http://www.glomis.com/ej/pdf/EJ_8-4.pdf |work=ISME/GLOMIS Electronic Journal |publisher=GLOMIS |accessdate=21 January 2012 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red mangroves can also store salt in cell [[vacuole]]s. As seen in the photograph on the right, white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly; they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their name—they are covered in white salt crystals).

===Limiting water loss===
Because of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their [[stomata]] (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange [[carbon dioxide]] gas and water vapour during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. Anthony Calfo, a noted [[aquarium]] author, observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-12/ac/feature/index.php |title=Calfo, Anthony (2006). '&amp;#39;Mangroves for the Marine Aquarium'&amp;#39; |publisher=Reefkeeping.com |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient uptake===
Because the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic [[bacteria]] liberate [[nitrogen]] gas, soluble ferrum ([[iron]]), inorganic [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfide]]s and [[methane]], which make the soil much less nutritious.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Pneumatophores ([[aerial root]]s) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as [[iron]], from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.

===Increasing survival of offspring===
[[File:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpg|thumb|Red mangrove seeds [[viviparity|germinate while still on the parent tree]].]]

In this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove [[seed]]s are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. [[Rhizophora mangle|red mangrove]]) are [[Vivipary|viviparous]], whose seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. ''[[Aegialitis]]'', ''[[Avicennia]]'' and ''[[Aegiceras]]''), or out through the fruit (e.g. ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Ceriops]]'', ''[[Bruguiera]]'' and ''[[Nypa (genus)|Nypa]]'') to form a [[propagule]] (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via [[photosynthesis]].

The mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The following listing (modified from Tomlinson, 1986) gives the number of species of mangroves in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ricklefs, R.

The Sundarbans in the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]] delta extend from the [[Hooghly River]] in [[West Bengal]] to the [[Baleswar River]] in [[Bangladesh]], covering an area of about {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This area comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, [[mudflat]]s and barren land. It is intersected by [[tidal]] streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans, viz [[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]] Wildlife Sanctuaries are enlisted as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. [[Biodiversity]] includes at least 27 mangrove species, 40 mammal, 35 reptile and 260 bird species.

It is the largest mangroves region and the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.
Sundri (''[[Heritiera fomes]]'') trees provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, also grow in some parts of the delta. India's mangrove forests are habitat for [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), turtles, and snakes. This region is part of the Great Sundarbans and covers a National Park, Tiger reserve and a Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name="walkthroughindiaTop5_wetland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/walkthroughs/top-5-largest-wetland-and-ramsar-sites-in-india/|title=Largest Wetland and Ramsar Sites in India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sundarbans was designated a Ramsar site on May 21, 1992. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective flood barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Kolkata]] against the result of cyclone activity. 
Sundarbans is home to many different species of birds, mammals, insects, reptiles and fish. It is estimated that there may be found more than 120 species of fish and over 260 species of birds and more than fifty species of reptiles and eight amphibians.

Pakistani mangroves are located mainly along the [[Indus River Delta|delta]] of the [[Indus River]] (the [[Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves]] [[ecoregion]]). Major mangrove forests are found on the coastline of the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].

In [[Karachi]], land reclamation projects have led to the cutting down of mangrove forests for commercial and urban development. On 22 June 2013, Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh, Pakistan, with the help of 300 local coastal volunteer planters set the Guinness World Record by planting 847,250 mangrove saplings at Kharo Chan, Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan in a little over 12 hours. This is the highest number of saplings planted within a day under the Guinness World Record category of "Maximum Number of Trees Planted in a Day".

Sindh Forest Department, Government of Sindh Mangrove has played pioneer role for the conservation and protection of the mangroves in the Indus Delta since late 1950s when it was handed over the areas. A breakthrough success is the re-introduction of ''[[Rhizophora mucronata]]'' into the Indus Delta, which had become extinct there. More recently, a threatened mangrove shrub, ''[[Ceriops tagal]]'', has also been successfully re-introduced. A third species, ''[[Aegiceras corniculatum]]'', is under trials at the nursery stage.

A gigantic initiative is under in the Sindh, Pakistan, to rehabilitate the degraded and blank mangrove mudflats. Since 2010 alone, around 55,000 Hectares of such area has been planted and rehabilitated. During this period, through concerted efforts and a rigorous conservation policy adopted by the Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh and the federal govt. a mangrove resource base of 150,000 plus Hectares has been created, with the support of local coastal communities. International organizations like IUCN and WWF are also playing critical role to support this initiative of the government. Other achievements include: (1) Declaring all the mangrove forests in the Indus Delta as Protected Forests in December 2010; Constitution of a Mangrove Conservation Committee at the provincial level which includes all stakeholders as members and overall awareness of the importance of mangroves and its ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Mangrove Planting"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624220628/http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 June 2013 | title=By planting 750,000 mangroves, Pakistan claims new world record.  | date=22 June 2013 | publisher=[[Express Tribune]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests on and near the island of [[Qeshm]] in the Persian Gulf are dominated by the species ''[[Avicennia marina]]'', known locally as the "hara" or "harra" tree, and cover an area of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km. This area is protected as the UNESCO [[Mangrove forests of Qeshm|Hara Biosphere Reserve]], where commercial use is restricted to fishing (mainly [[shrimp]]), tourist boat trips, and limited mangrove cutting for animal feed.

====Middle East====
Oman, near Muscat, supports large areas of mangroves, in particular at Shinas, Qurm Park and Mahout Island. In Arabic, mangrove trees are known as ''qurm'', thus the mangrove area in Oman is known as Qurm Park. A small mangrove area is present in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Mangroves are also present extensively in neighbouring Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Rouphael, Tony ;Turak, Emre and Brodie, Jon (1992) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090919204110/http://www.actfr.jcu.edu.au/idc/groups/public/documents/journal_article/jcudev_015628.pdf "Chapter 3: Seagrasses and Mangroves of Yemen's Red Sea"] In DouAbal, A. et al. (editors) (1992) ''Protection of Marine Ecosystems of the Red Sea Coast of Yemen'' Global Environment Facility, United Nations Development Programme, New York, pp. 41–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove is also widely seen in Tarut Island, east of Qatif in Saudi Arabia. In addition, large forest of mangrove surround the coast to the south of Qatif (Siahat Beach). Nonetheless, because of sea land re-claiming the mangrove is being cut down which makes lots of sea fish losses their natural habitats.

The mangrove forests that cover thousands of hectares of land along the UAE shoreline form an integral part of its coastal ecosystem. The [[Environment Agency Abu Dhabi|Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD)]] is currently working on rehabilitation, conservation and protection of mangrove forests in seven key sites in Abu Dhabi including: Saadiyat Island, Jubail Island, Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve (which also comprises famous Bu Tinah Island), Bu Syayeef Protected Area, Ras Gharab, the Eastern Corniche and Ras Ghanada.

===Oceania===
====Australia and New Guinea====
{{main|Australian mangroves}}
Australia and Papua New Guinea both rank in the top five mangrove holding nations globally.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 2018 497–520"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73016-5_22|title=Threats to Mangrove Forests|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart E.|last2=Castellanos-Galindo|first2=Gustavo A.|last3=Millones-Mayer|first3=Marco|last4=Chen|first4=Mara|date=2018|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319730158|series=Coastal Research Library|pages=497–520|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73016-5_22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than five species of Rhizophoraceae grow in [[Australasia]],&lt;ref name="FAO-2007"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |year=2007 |title=The world's mangroves, 1980–2005: a thematic study in the framework of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FAO forestry paper #153(FAO) Rome |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=tLdlpOiuSmEC|page=37}} |page =37 |isbn=978-92-5-105856-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with particularly high biodiversity on the [[island of New Guinea]] and northern Australia.&lt;ref name="FAO-2007"/&gt;

As of 2012 Australia has slightly below 1 million ha of mangrove &lt;ref name="Hamilton 2018 497–520"/&gt; and Papua New Guinea has just under approximately 500,000 ha +- 12% (CI 0.9, n = 7) of mangrove.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 2018 497–520"/&gt;

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] also has mangrove forests extending to around 38°S (similar to Australia's latitudinal limit): the southernmost examples are at [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan Harbour]] (37°48′S) on the west coast and Ohiwa Harbour (near [[Opotiki]], 38°00′S) on the east coast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
''[[Avicennia marina]] australasica'' is the only mangrove in New Zealand.

====Pacific islands====
Twenty-five species of mangrove are found on various Pacific islands, with extensive mangals on some islands. Mangals on [[Guam]], [[Palau]], [[Kosrae]] and [[Yap]] have been badly affected by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/pi179.htm |title=Hawaii and the Pacific Islands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927144136/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/SNT/noframe/pi179.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |author=Lloyd L. Loope |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangroves are not native to [[Hawaii]], but the red mangrove, ''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'', and Oriental mangrove, ''[[Bruguiera sexangula]]'', have been introduced and are now [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allen, James A.  |author2=Krauss, Ken W.  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Influence of propagule flotation longevity and light availability on establishment of introduced mangrove species in Hawai'i |journal=[[Pacific Science]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=367–376 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pacific_science/toc/psc60.3.html |doi=10.1353/psc.2006.0015 |hdl=10125/22572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both species are considered [[invasive species]] and classified as pests by the [[University of Hawaii]] Botany Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/cw_smith/aliens.htm Hawaiian Alien Plant Studies] – URL retrieved November 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bali Barat mangroves.jpg|thumb|Mangroves in [[West Bali National Park]], Indonesia.]]

Adequate data are only available for about half of the global area of mangroves. However, of those areas for which data has been collected, it appears that 35% of the mangroves have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) ''Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Synthesis'' (p.2) Island Press, Washington, DC. World Resources Institute {{ISBN|1-59726-040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and Hamilton (2013), estimate that [[shrimp farming]] causes approximately a quarter of the destruction of mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, D. and E.

Arlington, Virginia |publisher=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=2014-01-25|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this rapid loss rate appears to have decreased since 2000 with global losses estimated at between 0.16% and 0.39% annually between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite global loss rates decreasing since 2000, Southeast Asia remains an area of concern with loss rates between 3.58% and 8.08% between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Grassroots efforts to save mangroves from development are becoming more popular as their benefits become more widely known. In the [[Bahamas]], for example, active efforts to save mangroves are occurring on the islands of [[Bimini]] and [[Great Guana Cay]]. In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as well, efforts are underway to protect a mangrove threatened by the construction of a steelmill and a port.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In Thailand, community management has been effective in restoring damaged mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/thailand-mangrove-restoration-community-management.html |title=Thailand – Trang Province – Taking Back the Mangroves with Community Management &amp;#124; The EcoTipping Points Project |publisher=Ecotippingpoints.org |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within northern Ecuador mangrove regrowth is reported in almost all estuaries and stems primarily from local actors responding to earlier periods of deforestation in the Esmeraldas region.&lt;ref name="mingaonline.uach.cl"/&gt;

Mangroves have been reported to be able to help buffer against [[tsunami]], [[cyclone]]s, and other storms. One village in [[Tamil Nadu]] was protected from tsunami destruction—the villagers in [[Naluvedapathy]] planted 80,244 saplings to get into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. This created a kilometre-wide belt of trees of various varieties. When the tsunami struck, much of the land around the village was flooded, but the village itself suffered minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treecouncil.org.uk |title=Tree News, Spring/Summer 2005, Publisher Felix Press |publisher=Treecouncil.org.uk |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforestation==
[[File:Mangroves of Bohol.png|thumb|Mangroves in [[Bohol]], Philippines.]]

In some areas, mangrove reforestation and [[mangrove restoration]] is also underway. Red mangroves are the most common choice for cultivation, used particularly in [[marine aquariums]] in a [[sump]] to reduce [[nitrates]] and other [[nutrients]] in the water. Mangroves also appear in home [[aquariums]], and as ornamental plants, such as in [[Japan]].

In Senegal, [[Haïdar El Ali]] has started the {{Il|fr|Oceanium de Dakar}} project, which (amongst others) focuses on reforesting several areas with mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanium.blogspot.com/ |title=Oceanium de Dakar |publisher=Oceanium.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manzanar Mangrove Initiative is an ongoing experiment in [[Arkiko]], [[Eritrea]], part of the Manzanar Project founded by [[Gordon H. Sato]], establishing new mangrove plantations on the coastal [[mudflat]]s. Initial plantings failed, but observation of the areas where mangroves did survive by themselves led to the conclusion that nutrients in water flow from inland were important to the health of the mangroves. Trials with the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries followed, and a planting system was designed to provide the nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron missing from seawater.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SocWetlandSci"/&gt;

The propagules are planted inside a reused galvanized steel can with the bottom knocked out; a small piece of iron and a pierced plastic bag with fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus are buried with the propagule. {{As of|2007}}, after six years of planting, 700,000 mangroves are growing; providing stock feed for sheep and habitat for oysters, crabs, other bivalves, and fish.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"&gt;{{cite web

==National studies==
In terms of local and national studies of mangrove loss, the case of Belize's mangroves is illustrative in its contrast to the global picture. A recent, satellite-based study&lt;ref name="maps.cathalac.org"/&gt;—funded by the World Wildlife Fund and conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)—indicates Belize's mangrove cover declined by a mere 2% over a 30-year period. The study was born out of the need to verify the popular conception that mangrove clearing in Belize was rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/art/Pelican_Review.pdf |title=Pelican_Cays_Review |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the assessment showed, between 1980 and 2010, under {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} of mangroves had been cleared, although clearing of mangroves near Belize's main coastal settlements (e.g. [[Belize City]] and San Pedro) was relatively high. The rate of loss of Belize's mangroves—at 0.07% per year between 1980 and 2010—was much lower than Belize's overall rate of forest clearing (0.6% per year in the same period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servir.net/servir_bz_forest_cover_1980-2010.pdf Cherrington, E.A., Ek, E., Cho, P., Howell, B.F., Hernandez, B.E., Anderson, E.R., Flores, A.I., Garcia, B.C., Sempris, E., and D.E.

Nevertheless, the need to protect Belize's mangroves is imperative, as a 2009 study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) indicates the ecosystems contribute US$174–249 million per year to Belize's national economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdf.wri.org/working_papers/coastal_capital_belize_wp.pdf |title=Coastal Capital: Belize.

'''Marymount California University''' is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[university]] in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California|Rancho Palos Verdes]], [[California]].  Based in the liberal arts tradition and inspired by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RHSM), the university awards [[associate degree|associate]], [[bachelor's]], and [[graduate degree]]s.&lt;ref name="MCU web site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/academic-programs|title=Academic Program Information - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is [[Higher education accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wascsenior.org/institutions/marymount-california-university|title=Marymount California University - WASC Senior College and University Commission|website=Wascsenior.org|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Marymount California University was established in 1968 by the RHSM as Marymount Palos Verdes College. It was split from the original Marymount College in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]]; this Marymount later merged with St. Joseph's College and then Loyola University to form [[Loyola Marymount University]]. At the time, the college was a two-year institution of higher education. In 1975, responsibility for the College was transferred to a lay board of trustees.&lt;ref name="MCU web site-a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/?q=quick-facts|title=Quick Facts - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the college changed its name from Marymount Palos Verdes College to Marymount College. In summer 2011, Marymount opened its Waterfront Campus in downtown [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="dailybreeze.com"&gt;[http://www.dailybreeze.com/moresanpedro/ci_18680236?source=email] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2013, Marymount changed its name from Marymount College to Marymount California University to reflect "an ongoing transformation of the 45-year-old institution of higher education to a multi-campus institution offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs." In fall 2013, Marymount opened its Lakeside Campus in the community of Lucerne in rural Lake County, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=petersons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407074951/http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the university appointed trustee Brian Marcotte its new president. It was not immediately clear why the previous president, Lucas Lamadrid, left the position although the local newspaper ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' reported "allegations of inappropriate behavior, exorbitant spending and discriminatory conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailybreeze.com/2018/02/05/marymount-california-university-president-mia-amid-allegations-of-inappropriate-behavior/ |title= Marymount California University president MIA amid allegations of inappropriate behavior |author=Valerie Osier |publisher=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=February 5, 2018 |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mauna Kea Observatories''' ('''MKO''') are a number of independent astronomical research facilities and large telescope observatories that are located at the summit of [[Mauna Kea]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaiʻi]], [[United States]]. The facilities are located in a 525-acre (212&amp;nbsp;ha) special land use zone known as the "Astronomy Precinct", which is located within the 11,228-acre (4,544&amp;nbsp;ha) Mauna Kea Science Reserve.&lt;ref name=uhero&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Astronomy in Hawai‘i|url=http://www.uhero.hawaii.edu/assets/UHERO_Astronomy_Final.pdf|publisher=University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization|accessdate=14 July 2015|date=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Astronomy Precinct was established in 1967 and is located on land protected by the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|Historical Preservation Act]] for its significance to Hawaiian culture.

The location is near ideal because of its:
* [[light pollution|dark skies]] from lack of light pollution,
* good [[astronomical seeing]], 
* low [[Relative humidity|humidity]],  
* high altitude of {{convert|4,205|meter}}, 
* position above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere, 
* clean air, 
* good weather and 
* low latitude location.&lt;ref name="About Mauna Kea Observatories"&gt;[http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/about_maunakea.htm About Mauna Kea Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and background==
After studying photos for [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]] that contained greater detail than any ground-based telescope, [[Gerard Kuiper]] began seeking an arid site for infrared studies.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=November 1964|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=35|issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on [[Maui]]'s [[Haleakalā]] were promising, but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the "Big Island" of Hawaiʻi, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow, the air is extremely dry.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded Hawaiʻi Governor [[John A. Burns]] to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Pu{{okina}}u Poli{{okina}}ahu, a cinder cone peak.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yount1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Yount|title=Who Runs the University?: The Politics of Higher Education in Hawaii, 1985-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtnBE9CcxOAC&amp;pg=PA232|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1821-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astronomy Now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CB7yAAAAMAAJ|date=1991|publisher=Intra Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it.&lt;ref name="PARKER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry R. PARKER|title=Stairway to the Stars: The Story of the World’s Largest Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbkACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4899-6052-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the [[University of Hawaii]] placed a bid on behalf of the university.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverington2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leverington|title=A History of Astronomy: from 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r47qBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2124-4|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaminsPotter1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert M.

The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well-established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper, who felt that "his mountain" had been "stolen" from ''him''.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatarewicz1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph N. Tatarewicz|title=Space Technology &amp; Planetary Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnXQtlBcRFIC&amp;pg=PA82|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35655-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telescope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors, including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaiʻi agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light was seen in 1970.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Zirker|title=An Acre of Glass: A History and Forecast of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYYVXIePsy4C&amp;pg=PA94|date=18 October 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8234-0|pages=89–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups began requesting subleases on the newly accessible mountaintop. By 1970, two {{convert|24|in|m|1|abbr=on}} telescopes had been constructed by the [[United States Air Force]] and [[Lowell Observatory]]. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6&amp;nbsp;m [[Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope|CFHT]] on Mauna Kea.&lt;ref name="astro-timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Astronomy in Hawaiʻi|url=http://mkooc.org/css-timeline.html|publisher=Mauna Kea Observatories Outreach Committee|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=Andrew|last=Pickles|date=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727090520/http://mkooc.org/css-timeline.html|archivedate=July 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, local organizations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980.

==Management==
The Reserve was established in 1968, and is leased by the [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources|State of Hawaiʻi's Department of Land and Natural Resources]] (DLNR).&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malamamaunakea.org/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Office of Mauna Kea Management |accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaiʻi]] manages the site&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt; and leases land to several multi-national facilities, which have invested more than $2 billion in science and technology.&lt;ref name=uhero/&gt; The lease expires on 2033 and after that 40 of 45 square kilometers (25 of 28 square miles) revert to the state of Hawaii &lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Mauna Kea Observatories.jpg|alt=Mauna Kea Observatories seen from the base of Mauna Kea|thumb|Mauna Kea Observatories seen from the base of [[Mauna Kea]]]]
The altitude and isolation in the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] makes Mauna Kea one of the best locations on earth for ground-based astronomy. It is an ideal location for submillimeter, infrared and optical observations. The [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] statistics show that Mauna Kea is the best site in terms of optical and infrared image quality; for example, the CFHT site has a median seeing of 0.43 arcseconds.

Accommodations for research astronomers are located at the [[Onizuka Center for International Astronomy]] (often called Hale Pōhaku), {{convert|7|miles}} by unpaved steep road from the summit at {{convert|9300|ft|m}} above sea level.

An adjacent visitor information station is located at {{convert|9200|ft|m}}. The summit of Mauna Kea is so high that tourists are advised to stop at the visitor station for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to atmospheric conditions before continuing to the summit, and scientists often stay at Hale Pōhaku for eight hours or more before spending a full night at observatories on the summit, with some telescopes requiring observers to spend one full night at Hale Pōhaku before working at the summit.

==Telescopes==

Telescopes found at the summit of Mauna Kea are funded by government agencies of various nations. The University of Hawaiʻi directly administers two telescopes. In total, there are twelve facilities housing thirteen telescopes&lt;ref name=Telescopes&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauna Kea Observatories|url=https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/telescope_table.shtml|website=Maunakea Telescopes|publisher=University of Hawaii Institute of Astronomy|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at or around the summit of Mauna Kea. It may also be the site of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] and is a proposed site for [[Pan-STARRS]].

==Opposition and protests==
{{main|Opposition to the Mauna Kea Observatories}}
In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory after the initial project, causing opposition on the Big Island, in the city of [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. [[Native Hawaiians]] (kānaka ʻōiwi) believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; There has been substantial opposition to the Mauna Kea observatories that continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Oswalt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry D. Oswalt|title=The Future of Small Telescopes in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZqLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-010-0253-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites.&lt;ref name="DearKetchum2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dear|author2=Jim Ketchum|author3=Sarah Luria|author4=Doug Richardson|title=GeoHumanities: Art, History, Text at the Edge of Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwrJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT476|date=13 April 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-88347-7|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns, as did the [[National Audubon Society|Hawaiian Audubon Society]] who were supported by Governor [[George Ariyoshi]].&lt;ref name="PARKER2013" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered [[Palila]], a species [[Endemism|endemic]] to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non-native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations.&lt;ref name="Gordon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Gordon|title=Recollections of "Tucson Operations": The Millimeter-Wave Observatory of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWPbIrwEKpMC&amp;pg=PA136|date=18 July 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3236-3|pages=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Save Mauna Kea" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes, with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious.&lt;ref name="Oaks2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert F.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law''' ('''Max Planck Institute for International Law''', '''MPIL''') is a legal research institute located in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. It is operated by the [[Max Planck Society]].

The institute was founded in 1924 and was originally named the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Foreign and International Public Law'' and located in [[Berlin]]. It later relocated to Heidelberg and received its current name in 1949. The institute currently employs 69 scientific staff and is led by two co-directors, [[Armin von Bogdandy]] (since 2002) and [[Anne Peters]] (since 2013).&lt;ref name=MPILorg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|title=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law - History and Organization|accessdate=2010-01-10|work=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805001929/http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seated at [[Heidelberg University]]'s [[New Campus (University of Heidelberg)|New Campus]].

The institute is one of the most important research institutions in the [[German language in Europe|German-speaking world]] in the fields of [[international law]], [[European law]], [[comparative law|comparative]] [[public law]], and for the theoretical frameworks of [[transnational law]]. It has traditionally performed important advisory functions for parliaments, administrative organs and courts concerned with questions of public international law, comparative public law and European law. In particular, the institute has provided the [[German Federal Constitutional Court]], the [[German Bundestag]] and the [[German Federal Government]] with information, expert testimony and counsel, representing the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in several high-profile cases.&lt;ref name="MPILorg"/&gt;

The institute's directors regularly hold the chairs for international law at the [[University of Heidelberg Law School]]. Moreover, the institute's directors traditionally have held outstanding positions in national and international courts and bodies:

'''Media evaluation''' is a discipline of the [[social science]]s and centres on the analysis of media content rating the exposure using a number of pre-designated criteria commonly including tonal value and presence of key messages. It is said to be one of the fastest growing areas of [[mass communications]] research. 

[[The International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC)]] is the industry appointed trade body for companies and individuals involved in research, measurement and evaluation in editorial media coverage and related communications issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44251">'''Microbial metabolism''' is the means by which a [[microbe]] obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. [[carbon]]) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of [[metabolism|metabolic]] strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's [[ecological niche]], and often allow for that microbe to be useful in [[biotechnology|industrial processes]] or responsible for [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles.

==Types==
[[File:Troph flowchart.svg|thumb|350px|right|Flow chart to determine the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms]]
{{main|Primary nutritional groups}} 

All microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:

1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:
* '''[[autotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}})
* '''[[heterotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from [[organic compound]]s
* '''[[mixotroph]]ic''' – carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide
2. How the organism obtains [[reducing equivalent]]s used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:
* '''[[lithotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from [[inorganic compound]]s
* '''[[organotroph]]ic''' – reducing equivalents are obtained from organic compounds
3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:
* '''[[chemotroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from external [[chemical compound]]s
* '''[[phototroph]]ic''' – energy is obtained from light

In practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:

* '''chemolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples: [[Nitrifying bacteria]], Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria]], [[Knallgas-bacteria]]
* '''photolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from light and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic compounds. Examples: [[Cyanobacteria]] (water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) as reducing equivalent donor), [[Chlorobiaceae]], [[Chromatiaceae]] (hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|link=Hydrogen sulfide|H|2|S}}) as reducing equivalent donor), ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as reducing equivalent donor)
* '''chemolithoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}). Examples: some ''[[Hydrogenophilaceae|Thiobacilus]]'', some ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', some ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Wolinella]]'' (with {{chem|H|2}} as reducing equivalent donor), some [[Knallgas-bacteria]], some [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]
* '''chemoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most bacteria, e. g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp., ''[[Actinobacteria]]''
* '''photoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: ''[[Rhodobacter]]'', ''[[Rhodopseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rhodospirillum]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', ''[[Rhodocyclus]]'', ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)

==Heterotrophic microbial metabolism==

Some microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as [[commensals]] or [[parasite]]s) or find in dead organic matter of all kind ([[saprophage]]s). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms are heterotrophic by [[predation]] or [[parasitism]], properties also found in some bacteria such as ''[[Bdellovibrio]]'' (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as ''[[Myxococcus]]'' (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most [[pathogen]]ic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic [[polymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[chitin]] or [[lignin]] which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide ([[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in [[bioremediation]].

Biochemically, [[prokaryotic]] heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using [[glycolysis]] (also called [[Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas|EMP pathway]]) for sugar metabolism and the [[citric acid cycle]] to degrade [[acetate]], producing energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and reducing power in the form of [[NADH]] or [[quinols]].  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the [[KDPG pathway|keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway]] (also called [[Entner–Doudoroff pathway|ED pathway]]) in ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the [[mitochondrion]], the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[bacterium]] related to obligate intracellular ''[[Rickettsia]]'', and also to plant-associated ''[[Rhizobium]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium]]''.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these [[Proteobacteria]].  Most microbes [[Cellular respiration|respire]] (use an [[electron transport chain]]), although [[oxygen]] is not the only [[terminal electron acceptor]] that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.

==Fermentation==
{{main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}

Fermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses [[organic compound|organic carbon]] instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to {{chem|NAD|+}} and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of {{chem|NAD|+}} for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and [[aerobic respiration]] when oxygen is present.  These organisms are [[facultative anaerobe]]s.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately]] fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an [[ATP synthase]] as in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] where a [[phosphate]] group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of [[Coenzyme A]]-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including [[hydrogen]] gas ({{chem|H|2}}). These reduced organic compounds are generally small [[organic acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s derived from [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], the end product of [[glycolysis]]. Examples include [[ethanol]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[butyric acid|butyrate]]. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.

Not all fermentative organisms use substrate-level [[phosphorylation]]. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a [[proton motive force|proton (or sodium) motive force]] and therefore [[ATP synthesis]].  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include [[succinate]] fermentation by ''[[Propionigenium modestum]]'' and [[oxalate]] fermentation by ''[[Oxalobacter formigenes]]''. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce [[Lactic acid|lactate]] from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.

==Special metabolic properties==

===Methylotrophy===

Methylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use [[C1-compounds]] as energy sources. These compounds include [[methanol]], [[methyl amine]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and [[formic acid|formate]].  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria ''[[Methylomonas]]'' and ''[[Methylobacter]]''.  [[Methanotroph]]s are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}), formaldehyde ({{chem|CH|2|O}}), formate ({{chem|HCOO|-}}), and carbon dioxide {{CO2}} initially using the enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]].  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are [[obligate aerobe]]s.  Reducing power in the form of [[quinone]]s and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to {{CO2}} (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the [[serine pathway]] (''[[Methylosinus]]'', ''[[Methylocystis]]'') or the [[ribulose monophosphate pathway]] (''[[Methylococcus]]''), depending on the species of methylotroph.

In addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of [[methanogen]]ic [[Archaea]] working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.

[[Methanogenesis]] is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] Archaea such as ''[[Methanococcus]]'', ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'', ''[[Methanobacterium]]'',
''[[Methanothermus]]'', ''[[Methanosarcina]]'', ''[[Methanosaeta]]'' and ''[[Methanopyrus]]''.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as [[coenzyme M]] and [[methanofuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=DiMarco AA, Bobik TA, Wolfe RS |title=Unusual coenzymes of methanogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=59 |pages=355&amp;ndash;94 |year=1990 |pmid=2115763 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.59.070190.002035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a [[proton]] gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) to methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}})  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]].  A second group of methanogens use methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using {{CO2}} as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|COO|-}}) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the [[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] to fix {{CO2}} and obtain cellular carbon.

===Syntrophy===

Syntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a [[chemical reaction]] that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, [[ethanol]] and [[butyrate]]) by organisms such as ''[[Syntrophomonas]]''.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a [[hydrogenotrophic]] (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm) and thereby shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is "pulled" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and {{CO2}}.

==Anaerobic respiration==

While [[aerobic organism]]s during respiration use oxygen as a [[terminal electron acceptor]], [[anaerobic organism]]s use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many [[facultative anaerobe]]s can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.

Most respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of [[anaerobic respiration]] are also known.

===Denitrification – nitrate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Denitrification}}

Denitrification is the utilization of [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) and some organic [[electron acceptor]]s.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and dinitrogen ({{chem|N|2}}) by the enzymes [[nitrate reductase]], [[nitrite reductase]], nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri]]'') reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important [[greenhouse gas]]es that react with [[sunlight]] and [[ozone]] to produce nitric acid, a component of [[acid rain]].  Denitrification is also important in biological [[wastewater]] treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing [[eutrophication]].

===Sulfate reduction – sulfate as electron acceptor===
{{main|Sulfate-reducing bacteria}}

[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction]] is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the [[deltaproteobacteria]], Gram-positive organisms relating to ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' or the archaeon ''[[Archaeoglobus]]''. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.

====Electron donors====

Many sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as [[electron donor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishimoto M, Koyama J, Nagai Y |title=Biochemical Studies on Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: IV. The Cytochrome System of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria|journal=J Biochem |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=763–70 |date=September 1954 |url=http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/41/6/763}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno O, Li YY, Noike T |title= The behavior of sulfate-reducing bacteria in acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion |journal=Water Research |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1626–34 |date=May 1998 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00372-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some unusual autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Desulfobacteraceae|Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans]]'') can use [[phosphite]] ({{chem|HPO|3|-}}) as an electron donor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schink B, Thiemann V, Laue H, Friedrich MW |title= ''Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans'' sp. nov., a new marine sulfate reducer that oxidizes phosphite to phosphate |journal=Arch Microbiol |volume=177 |issue=5 |pages= 381–91|date=May 2002 |pmid=11976747 |doi= 10.1007/s00203-002-0402-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others (e.g. ''[[Desulfovibrio|Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes]]'', ''[[Desulfobulbaceae|Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens]]'') are capable of sulfur disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to produce both hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) and sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson BE, McInerney MJ |title=Thiosulfate Disproportionation by Desulfotomaculum thermobenzoicum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=3650–3|date=August 2000 |pmid=10919837 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.66.8.3650-3653.2000 |pmc= 92201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy for reduction====

All sulfate-reducing organisms are strict anaerobes.  Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form [[sulfite]] ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.

===Acetogenesis – carbon dioxide as electron acceptor===
{{main|Acetogenesis}}

Acetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide [[Redox|reduction]] in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.

===Other inorganic electron acceptors===

Ferric iron ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in [[electron transport]], ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'' and ''[[Geobacter|Geobacter metallireducens]]''.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''G. metallireducens'') can use toxic [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated [[aquifer]]s.

Although ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other [[inorganic]] ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when [[heavy metals]] or [[radionuclide]]s are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:
* [[Manganese|Manganic ion]] ({{chem|Mn|4+}}) reduction to [[manganous ion]] ({{chem|Mn|2+}})
* [[Selenium|Selenate]] ({{chem|SeO|4|2-}}) reduction to [[Selenium|selenite]] ({{chem|SeO|3|2-}}) and selenite reduction to inorganic [[selenium]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Arsenic|Arsenate]] ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) reduction to [[arsenic|arsenite]] ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}})
* [[Uranyl|Uranyl ion]] ion ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}) reduction to [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}})

===Organic terminal electron acceptors===

A number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:
* [[Fumarate]] reduction to [[succinate]]
* [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|Trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO) reduction to [[trimethylamine]] (TMA)
* [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) reduction to [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS)
* Reductive dechlorination
TMAO is a chemical commonly produced by [[fish]], and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.

==Chemolithotrophy==

[[Chemolithotrophy]] is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).

===Hydrogen oxidation===
{{main|Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria}}
Many organisms are capable of using hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen [[oxidation]] have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100040856| title=knallgas reaction| publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy

In these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound [[hydrogenase]] causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and [[cytochrome]]s.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the [[Calvin cycle]].  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as ''Cupriavidus necator'' (formerly ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]''), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.

===Sulfur oxidation===

Sulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide {{chem|H|2|S}}), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to form [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', a microbe originally described by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. Another example is ''[[Paracoccus]]''. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using [[reverse electron flow]], an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their [[thermodynamic]] gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2−}}) and subsequently converted to sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}) by the enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]].&lt;ref name="sulfite"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kappler U, Bennett B, Rethmeier J, Schwarz G, Deutzmann R, McEwan AG, Dahl C |title= Sulfite:Cytochrome ''c'' Oxidoreductase from ''Thiobacillus novellus''.  Purification, Characterization, and Molecular Biology of a Heterodimeric Member of the Sulfite Oxidase Family |journal= J Biol Chem |volume=275 |issue=18 |pages=13202–12|date=May 2000 |pmid=10788424 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.275.18.13202 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/275/18/13202.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see [[Microbial metabolism#Energy for reduction|above]]).  In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.&lt;ref name="sulfite" /&gt;  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. ''[[Thiobacillus denitrificans]]'') use nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.

===Ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) oxidation===
{{further information|Acidophiles in acid mine drainage}}

[[Iron(II) oxide|Ferrous iron]] is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low [[pH]]s or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|3}}).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]]s, such as the bacteria ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]'', as well as the [[archaeon]] ''[[Ferroplasma]]''.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in [[acid mine drainage]].  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example ''[[Gallionella ferruginea]]'', ''[[Leptothrix ochracea]]'', or ''[[Mariprofundus ferrooxydans]]'') live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are  microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Rhodopseudomonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiao Y, Kappler A, Croal LR, Newman DK |title= Isolation and Characterization of a Genetically Tractable Photoautotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain TIE-1 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=4487–96|date=August 2005 |pmid=16085840 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.71.8.4487-4496.2005 |pmc= 1183355}}&lt;/ref&gt; which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme [[rusticyanin]] to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.

===Nitrification===

Nitrification is the process by which [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3}}) is converted to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite ({{chem|link=Nitrite|NO|2|-}}) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrobacter]]'').  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to [[hydroxylamine]] ({{chem|NH|2|OH}}) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the [[cytoplasm]], followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the [[periplasm]].

Electron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.

In 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'' is capable of complete nitrification ([[Comammox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complete nitrification by a single microorganism|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/full/nature16459.html#ref4|journal = Nature|date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 555–559|volume = 528|issue = 7583|doi = 10.1038/nature16459|first = Maartje A.

===Anammox===

Anammox stands for anaerobic ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible were relatively recently discovered, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strous M |title=Missing lithotroph identified as new planctomycete |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6743 |pages=446–9 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10440372 |doi=10.1038/22749 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Fuerst JA |author3=Kramer EH |display-authors=3 |last4=Kramer |first4=Evelien H. M. |last5=Logemann |first5=Susanne |last6=Muyzer |first6=Gerard |last7=Van De Pas-Schoonen |first7=Katinka T. |last8=Webb |first8=Richard |last9=Kuenen |first9=J. Gijs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of metabolism occurs in members of the [[Planctomycetes]] (e.g. Candidatus ''[[Brocadia anammoxidans]]'') and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite reduction.  As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are strict anaerobes.  Amazingly, [[hydrazine]] ({{chem|N|2|H|4}} – rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism.  To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) [[ladderane]] lipid membrane.  These lipids are unique in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate.  Anammox organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is unclear.  Because of this property, these organisms could be used to remove nitrogen in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu G, Peng Y, Li B, Guo J, Yang Q, Wang S |title=Biological removal of nitrogen from wastewater |journal=Rev Environ Contam Toxicol |volume=192 |issue= |pages=159–95 |year=2008 |pmid=18020306 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71724-1_5 |series=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |isbn=978-0-387-71723-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anammox has also been shown to have widespread occurrence in anaerobic aquatic systems and has been speculated to account for approximately 50% of nitrogen gas production in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Op den Camp HJ |title=Global impact and application of the anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=34 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=174–8 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16417514 |doi=10.1042/BST0340174 |name-list-format=vanc }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phototrophy==
{{Main|Phototrophic prokaryotes}}

Many microbes (phototrophs) are capable of using light as a source of energy to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[organic compound]]s such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s.  Of these, [[algae]] are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using water as an [[electron donor]] for electron transfer during photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gräber| first1=Peter| last2=Milazzo|first2=Giulio| title= Bioenergetics| year= 1997| publisher=Birkhäuser| page= 80| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N-EUfoA4tCIC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=oxygenic+photosynthesis+algae+water+%22electron+donor%22&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=oxygenic%20photosynthesis%20algae%20water%20%22electron%20donor%22| isbn= 978-3-7643-5295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla [[Cyanobacteria]], [[Chlorobi]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]], and [[Firmicutes]].&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on [[Earth]]. Because [[chloroplast]]s were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these [[endosymbiont]]s can also be applied to chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McFadden G |title=Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=513–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10607659 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) as an electron donor to produce sulfate.  Inorganic sulfur ({{chem|S|0}}), thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) and ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) can also be used by some organisms.  Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), [[Green sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chlorobium]]), [[Green non-sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chloroflexus]]), or the [[heliobacteria]] (Low %G+C Gram positives).  In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon ''[[Halobacterium]]'' or the bacterium ''[[Roseobacter]]'', among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488&amp;ndash;96 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.  All photosynthetic organisms locate their [[photosynthetic reaction center]]s  within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] (Proteobacteria), [[thylakoid membrane]]s (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called [[chlorosome]]s (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoids]], allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and thereby inhabit different [[ecological niche|niche]]s.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. [[phycobilisome]]s in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.

Biochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the [[Z scheme]] of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein [[ferredoxin]], an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.

Most photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).

==Nitrogen fixation==
{{main|Nitrogen fixation}}

Nitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the [[atmosphere]], dinitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high [[activation energy]].  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cabello P, Roldán MD, Moreno-Vivián C |title=Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3527&amp;ndash;46 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528644 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.27303-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/11/3527?view=long&amp;pmid=15528644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between [[legume]]s and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.

Nitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:
* heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. ''[[Anabaena]]'') where one cell does not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in turn provide it with energy
* root nodule symbioses (e.g. ''[[Rhizobium]]'') with plants that supply oxygen to the bacteria bound to molecules of [[leghaemoglobin]]
* anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'')
* very fast metabolism (e.g. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'')
The production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16–24 ATP are used per {{chem|N|2}} fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.

'''México Indígena''' is a project of the [[American Geographical Society]] to organize teams of geographers to research the geography of indigenous populations in Mexico. The project's stated objective is to map "changes in the cultural landscape and conservation of natural resources" that result from large scale land privatization initiatives underway in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prmapping.res.ku.edu/Mexico_Indigena/ |accessdate=5 December 2016 |title=México Indígena |publisher=University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is led by Peter Herlihy at the [[University of Kansas]] and is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense through its Foreign Military Studies Office. The project has been the subject of criticism by various groups including groups representing indigenous peoples. Critics allege that the project was not forthcoming about its U.S. military funding, and that the project has various ulterior motives besides gathering information for research purposes. The project began in 2005, and lasted through 2008.

==Project and objectives==
The México Indígena was the first in a series of planned projects to enhance United States government geographical data around the world.&lt;ref name=Herlihy/&gt; The stated objective is to produce maps of the "digital human terrain," of the region's indigenous peoples. To accomplish this, the American Geographical Society sent geographers to several regions to gather cultural and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data and build relationships with local institutions.&lt;ref name=Herlihy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023846/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |title=A Digital Geography of Indigenous Mexico: Prototype for the American Geographical Society's Bowman Expeditions |journal=Geographical Review |vauthors=Herlihy PH, Dobson JE, Robledo MA, Smith DA, Kelly JH, Viera AR |date=July 2008 |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=395–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

México Indígena was led by a team of [[geographer]]s who specialize in [[Latin American]], including [[Peter Herlihy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |title=KU Geography Department |publisher=.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916213109/http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~latamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516044624/http://www2.ku.edu/%7Elatamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Jeremy Dobson and Miguel Aguilar Robledo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609110554/http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project methods==
México Indígena's primary method for obtaining and understanding geographic data is [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] mapping (PRM). In PRM, local investigators, chosen by the communities, are trained by the formal researcher in geographic data gathering techniques. Cognitive mental (individual) maps are converted to consensual (community) maps, including only features whose nature, name, and coordinates have been verified. These are then converted to standardized maps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedlanguage.com/maps_of_the_world/map_of_mexico.shtml |title=410 « « CapitaCapita |publisher=Appliedlanguage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the communities may choose to use for educational, political, legal, or other, purposes. Participatory maps of resource-use areas, for example, have been used successfully for indigenous territorial claims in Panama (Herlihy 2003) and elsewhere.  México Indígena's primary tool for joining data from different sources to produce maps and to analyze trends is [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In many respects the México Indígena project is an example of [[military geography]]. "FMSO's goal is to help increase an understanding of the world's cultural terrain." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108191619/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges' International Development Project Database Survey notes that the México Indígena research project has received between $751,000-$1,000,000 from all sources external funds, including: U.S. Department of Defense, Foreign Military Studies Office; U.S. Department of State, Fulbright-Garcia Robles; the American Geographical Society; the University of Kansas' Center of Latin American Studies; Mexico's Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales; and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |title=Nasulgc |publisher=Nasulgc.advcomp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610063120/http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |archivedate=2012-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
'''Imperial Geography: Geopiratería'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mibug.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/geopirateria/ |title=GEOPIRATERÍA &amp;#124; BREVARIO 2013 |publisher=Mibug.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false attribution of location in the [[visual arts]] has been deemed "geopiracy" by Vogel (2006) and rigorously defined  in Vogel et al. (2008). México Indígena raises consequential questions when humans are ''not'' [[falsity|falsely]] situated (located) in digitally-generated topographies of the human terrain. The [[ethical]] questions generated by the moral quagmire associated with efforts such as the México Indígena project have yet to be adequately addressed. While México Indígena's ethical guidelines explicitly assert "No information will be acquired through [[deception]] or misrepresentation" &lt;ref name="web.ku.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |accessdate=October 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513151717/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; significant concerns have arisen regarding the nature of the research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciudadania-express.com/?s=Bowman&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Bowman |publisher=Ciudadania Express |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the project's embrace of a putatively [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] [[methodology]] that ostensibly "empowers" the local community in geographic knowledge generation and manipulation. Naïve statements by team leaders of Mexico Indígena's controversial [[land titling]] project designed to produce "digital human terrains," (for example, "Experience has proven that, when communities themselves give the world their understandings of their land, the world is better equipped to respect these alternative understandings"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510030525/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; underscore legitimate and deeply troubling questions that have emerged surrounding the ethical conduct of the US-based researchers involved in México Indígena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:ua2De7IgJ9oJ:https://us.indymedia.org/us/servlet/OpenMir%3Fdo%3Dgetpdf%26id%3D28825%26forIE%3D.pdf+%22Peter+Herlihy%22+AND+Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; México Indígena project leader Peter Herlihy and the editor of "Participatory Mapping of Indigenous Lands in Latin America" a special Issue of  the journal ''Human Organization'' of the [[Applied Anthropology Association]] initially explained to the Union of Organizations of the [[Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca|Sierra Juarez]] of [[Oaxaca]] (UNOSJO, S.C.) that the proposed research objective was to assess the influence that the Mexican Government's PROCEDE program has had on indigenous people's communities. Nevertheless, Herlihy did not explain that the research initiative he led was financed by [[United States]] [[Army]]'s Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO), nor did he mention that research findings would be given directly to FMSO. As the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]'s indigenous organization, the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of [[Oaxaca]] notes, "Herlihy neglected to mention this despite being expressly asked to clarify the eventual use of the data obtained through research."

Moreover, he noted that "Geographical intelligence is needed for peace and prosperity just like it is needed for war and destruction,".&lt;ref name="kansan1"/&gt; Recently, a number of geographers have written to the AAG requesting that it conduct its own inquiry into the nature and consequences of Peter Herlihy's research in Mexico, which they "feel violated the ethical norms of our profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_5722_s09/SelectedResponsestoAGS.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Esteban Ortiz Rodea, the Mexican State representative for the Secretary for the Environment and Natural Recourses (SEMARNAT) has publicly acknowledged that no Federal funds were used to support the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in the communities of the Sierra Juárez. Moreover, Aldo González, the leader of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSOJO) apparently only became aware of "México Indígena's" ties to FMSO very recently.

As the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca's press release indicates, Zapotec Indigenous Peoples in Mexico are demanding full transparency from the U.S. scholar leading the [[United States Department of Defense]] funded project. In their words, "Prof. Herlihy failed to mention that he received funding from the Foreign Military Studies Office of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The failure to obtain full, free and prior [[informed consent]] is a violation of the rights of indigenous communities as codified in the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2007." (according to UN Declaration Article 11/2, research must be conducted with free prior and informed consent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Robert |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/new-war-for-hearts-and-minds |title=U.S. Military's New Afghanistan Strategy from the Front Lines |publisher=MensJournal.com |date=2010-08-15 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by the website ''El Enemigo Común'' in their essay 'A Road to Hell', "The role of the Foreign Military Studies Office in identifying 'emerging and asymmetric' threats in Oaxaca, Mexico is chilling to say the least. Fort Leavenworth has a vast array of knowledge with regards to how neo-liberal changes in Mexico's property regime will affect indigenous culture and land use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |accessdate=February 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211205/http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |archivedate=October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the "México Indígena" project are disseminated monthly at Fort Leavenworth's Foreign Military Studies Office. It is reported that during a conversation between Gen. [[Petraeus]] and the project leaders of México Indígena, Petraeus observed that, "knowledge of the cultures is a multiplier of [military] forces…the knowledge of cultural ` terrain' can be as important, and at times more, than the knowledge of the geographic terrain". Accordingly, the project heads of México Indígena are reported to have stated that "the culture and local residents are then the 'decisive terrain'".&lt;ref name="narconews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narconews.com/Issue55/article3382.html |title=Geo-Piracy in Oaxaca... and Much More |publisher=Narco News |date=2000-04-18 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called-participatory mapping (PRM) is a [[Scientific technique|technique]] that fully capitalizes on local [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[knowledge]] in the creation of "formalized" [[map]]s necessary for the creation of [[neo-liberal]] [[property]] regimes. According to an excerpt from 2006 ''Methodological Approaches'' Report of México Indígena: "The participatory mapping, or PM, methodology rests on the philosophy that local populations have some of the best and most detailed knowledge of their surrounding lands and resources and that can be collected and interpreted geographically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207021145/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |title=Geographical Review July 2008 |publisher=Amergeog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215034151/http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglecting to disclose funding sources to research participants violate the ethical principles of both the Association of American Geographers (AAG) as well as the [[Belmont Report]]. Failure to inform participants about the potential [[risk]]s or unintended consequences associated with the study abrogates the principal of informed consent, and hence violates the rights of the project participant's. México Indígena's military-funded investigations do in fact pose a risk in Oaxaca for individuals and communities, especially in light of the fractious and divisive  nature of village and inter-village politics in Southern Mexico, not to mention the socio-political turmoil in this region that has been fragmented by international migration, political factionalism and economic marginalization.

Notwithstanding such critiques, in Peter Herlihy's estimation, ''México Indígena'' is a concerted effort to renew "society's commitment to inform the public and the United States government about world geography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://communicate.aag.org/eseries/aag_org/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=19562]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Geographical Society]] has been clear about the potential sanctions accompanying a breach of ethical conduct. According to an AGS document released on the  ''México Indígena'' web site called "Developing Guidelines for Ethical Conduct of Foreign Field Research":
"''Lead scholars and other members of AGS-sponsored expeditions must comport themselves in a manner that respects cultures in the host country while simultaneously adhering to widely held values of American culture. Their actions must not adversely affect the people or natural environments of host countries. A significant breach of this provision may result in recall of individuals or entire expeditions''." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSJO) has reiterated its rejection of the [[University of Kansas]] [[geographers]] associated with the ''México Indígena'' Project for [[fail]]ing to obtain [[informed consent]] from the communities involved in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricada.blogcindario.com/2009/02/01354-ii-congreso-appo.html |title=II CONGRESO APPO. - Barricada de Oaxaca |publisher=Barricada.blogcindario.com |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/XStatic/excelsior/template/content.aspx?se=nota&amp;id=514195 |accessdate=February 21, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicadas por JA |url=http://dechivolostamales.blogspot.com/2009/02/la-geopirateria-estrategia-del.html |title=De chivo, los tamales (v2.0): La geopiratería, estrategia del Pentágono: el caso de Oaxaca |publisher=Dechivolostamales.blogspot.com |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNOSJO continues to maintain that research was conducted in a [[covert]] fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com/2009/02/congreso-de-la-appo.html |title=la_barricada_oaxaqueña: CONGRESO DE LA APPO |publisher=Barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the coordinator of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca Aldo González Rojas is reported to have said in Spanish that "the looting of traditional Zapotec knowledge about land and territoriality is tantamount to geopiracy (geopiratería), which is being conducted through the work of México Indígena in the indigenous communities of the Sierra. This in turn has generated an international debate over the ethical nature of social research conducted in indigenous communities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225073702/http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |archivedate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo González Rojas, speaking on behalf of UNOSJO, has indicated that it is necessary to determine if the information collected by "México Indígena" is for U.S. military or counter-insurgency purposes.  As such, UNOSJO has called for complete disclosure of the institutions and corporations with privileged [[access control|access]] to the data collected by México Indigena. UNOSJO holds that the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] funded [[Isaiah Bowman|Bowman]] expedition in [[Mexico]] is dedicated to developing [[military]] [[Military tactics|tactics]] for application in zones of armed conflict.  UNOSJO continues to claim that Mexico's Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) has financed the work of México Indígena through its support of the University of San Luis. SEMARNAT has previously disputed UNOSJO's claim, saying they have not funded the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in indigenous or mestizo communities in the Sierra Juárez. According to Esteban Ortiz Rodea, reports from the indigenous communities of Tiltepec, Yagavila, Ixtlán, Yagila and Guelatao suggest few indications of the actual communal collection of zapping information, despite "México Indígena" project's championing of PRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |title=Imparcial en Línea |publisher=Imparcialenlinea.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126161856/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Population [[geography]]''' is a division of [[human geography]]. It is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places. Population geography involves [[demography]] in a geographical perspective.{{efn|While population geography focuses on the impacts of population on ''spatial'' structures and processes, geodemography analyzes the effects of space on ''demographic'' structures and processes. However, the boundary between population geography and demography is becoming more and more blurred.}} It focuses on the characteristics of population distributions that change in a spatial context. This often involves factors such as where populations are found and how the size and composition of these populations is regulated by the demographic processes of [[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and [[Human migration|migration]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castree, N., Kitchin, Rogers|title=population geography. In A Dictionary of Human Geography.|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199599868.001.0001/acref-9780199599868-e-1426|website=Penn State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions to population geography are cross-disciplinary because geographical epistemologies related to environment, place and space have been developed at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gresh A. &amp; Maharaj P.|title=Policy and Programme Responses|url=https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8357-2_11#citeas|website=Penn State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related disciplines include geography, demography, [[sociology]], and [[economics]].

Since its inception, population geography has taken at least three distinct but related forms, the most recent of which appears increasingly integrated with human geography in general. The earliest and most enduring form of population geography emerged in the 1950s, as part of [[spatial science]]. Pioneered by Glenn Trewartha, Wilbur Zelinsky, William A. V. Clark, and others in the United States, as well as Jacqueline Beujeau-Garnier and Pierre George in France, it focused on the systematic study of the distribution of population as a whole and the spatial variation in population characteristics such as fertility and mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Population geography defined itself as the systematic study of:

# the simple description of the location of population numbers and characteristics

# the explanation of the spatial configuration of these numbers and characteristics

# the geographic analysis of population phenomena (the inter-relations among real differences in population with those in all or certain other elements within the geographic study area).

Accordingly, it categorized populations as groups synonymous with political jurisdictions representing gender, religion, age, disability, generation, sexuality, and race, variables which go beyond the vital statistics of births, deaths, and marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given the rapidly growing global population as well as the baby boom in affluent countries such as the United States, these geographers studied the relation between demographic growth, displacement, and access to resources at an international scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples can be shown through population density maps. A few types of maps that show the spatial layout of population are [[choropleth]], [[Contour line|isoline]], and dot maps.

==Case studies==
{{tone|section|date=August 2018}}

===Suburbanization===

[[Suburbanization]] in the developed part of [[North America]] has roots in the migration decisions of many families who leave central cities and relocate on the [[urban area|urban]] fringe. This type of metropolitan decentralization matters because it contributes to the pressures on [[rural area|rural]] and "green-field" land, the under-funding of inner-city schools, the continuing segregation of groups in society, and the difficulties some suburban housewives encounter in finding jobs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bailey, A. (2014). ''Making population geography''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://sk8es4mc2l.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=sersol&amp;SS_jc=TC0000422501&amp;title=Making%20population%20geography&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and Palestine===

When the political creation of [[Israel]] was brokered in 1948, the act of drawing boundaries created new populations and divided others. Specifically, the displacement of thousands of residents of the former [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the wholesale destruction of over 500 Arab villages created a [[refugee]] population that is, today, the world’s largest (over 4 million) and longest-lasting, including over two generations.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Palestinian refugee communities lack access to human rights, protection, territorially rooted homelands and land that can support reasonable livelihoods. Refugee populations are some of the world’s poorest, most insecure, most fragile, and most dependent communities. While poverty and endemic insecurity characterize Palestinian refugees, the state of Israel is both threatened by the co-presence of this refugee community and complicit/active in its maintenance, through acts purported as securing the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Tuberculosis in immigrants===

[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) was a leading cause of death among young men and women in many North American cities at the turn of the 20th century. Medical discoveries about the spread of the disease and childhood vaccinations helped to decrease TB infections and case mortality rates declined steadily during the century. However, by the early 1990s, figures by place of birth suggested that foreign-born persons were eight times more likely to die from TB than native-born Americans.{{cn|date=August 2018}} By studying the geographic context of disease, it becomes apparent that TB is less a marker of immigration than it is of poverty. Increasing TB levels in parts of the former [[Soviet Union]] territories and [[Haiti]] suggest that unemployment, poor access to underfunded healthcare systems, and stress all elevate risk. Immigrants also do not seem to be bringing TB to the United States but instead developing TB once inside the country. Concentrations of TB among immigrants in non-traditional destination states may suggest poor agricultural working conditions, barriers to accessing healthcare, and concentrations of refugee groups in unhealthy areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Africa’s baby boom===

[[Africa]] has now become the fastest-growing and fastest-urbanizing continent. Africa's population is estimated to reach two billion by 2050. As countries get richer, they experience a demographic transition. Africa's people are its biggest asset; one day, its workforce could be as robust and dynamic as Asia's. But there is nothing inevitable about the ability to cash in the demographic dividend. For that to happen, Africa will have to choose the right policies and overcome its many problems.&lt;ref&gt;The Baby Bonanza; Africa's Population. (2009, Aug 29). ''The Economist, 392'', 21-24. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/docview/223965384?accountid=13158&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global population aging===

The traditional [[United Nations]] definition of retirees is defined as age 65.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The population aging that is presently occurring is unprecedented. Over the next decade, the number of people aged 60 years and over is expected to rise substantially, and most of the increase will occur in developing countries. Globally, the number of older persons is expected to exceed the number of children in 2045 for the first time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;(2011), Department of Economic and Social Affairs; ''World Population Ageing 2009''. Population and Development Review, 37: 403. doi:10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00421.x&lt;nowiki&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00421.x/abstract&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidly aging population is likely to have far-reaching effects. Economically, population aging affects growth, savings, investments, consumption, labor markets, social security systems, taxation, and inter-generational transfers. Socially, it influences family structures, housing demands, migration trends, and the epidemiology of diseases and the need for healthcare service. Politically, it shapes voting patterns and representation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Population aging has received considerable attention in developed countries, but only in the past few decades has awareness of the ramifications of a rapidly aging population grown in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gresh A., Maharaj P. (2013) Policy and Programme Responses. In: Maharaj P. (eds) Aging and Health in Africa. International Perspectives on Aging, vol 4. Springer, Boston, MA. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8357-2_11#citeas&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* The way from the geographical character of places, e.g. settlement patterns

All of the above are looked at over space and time. Population geography also studies the relationships between man and his environment, including problems from those relationships, such as [[overpopulation]], pollution, and others.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], author of ''Rabelais and His World'', pictured in 1920]]
'''''Rabelais and His World''''' (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa''; 1965) is a scholarly work which is considered one of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s most important texts and now a classic of [[Renaissance]] studies. In the work Bakhtin explores ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' by the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]],'' which is defined as a literary mode.  

Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt; As written, ''Rabelais and His World'' not only examines the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', it also serves as an example of such openness.

==History of the text==
Bakhtin completed his book on Rabelais (titled ''Rabelais in the History of Realism'') in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree at the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents were in favor of awarding Bakhtin a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]]: the [[Doctor of Sciences]], and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's [[Higher Attestation Commission|VAK]] decided Bakhtin would only receive the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree&lt;ref&gt;See commentary to vol. 4 of Bakhtin's Collected Writings (''Sobranie sochinenii'', Moscow: Russkie Slovari, 2008–2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly equivalent to a [[research doctorate]]). The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance''. Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, ''Rabelais and His World''.

==Carnival==
{{Main article|Carnivalesque}}
For Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is associated with the collectivity. Those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd; rather the people are seen as a
whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"&gt;Clark and Holquist 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, “[A]ll were considered equal during carnival.  Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 10&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals to feel they are a part of the collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves.  It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed.  At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one’s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"/&gt;

==Grotesque==

{{Main article|Grotesque body}}

Bakhtin’s notion of ''carnival'' is connected with that of the ''grotesque''. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection to the life of the community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.&lt;br&gt;
In the grotesque body, emphasis is placed on the open, the penetrative, and the "lower stratum." The open (the mouth, the anus, the vagina, etc.) and the penetrative (the nose, the penis, etc.) allow exchange between the body and the world (mostly through sex, eating, and drinking), but also to produce degrading material (curses, urine, feces, etc.). The lower stratum (belly, womb, etc.) is the place where renewal happens, where new life is forged, thus connecting degradation to renewal. The grotesque body is one of excess, rebellious to authority and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Rabelais and His World|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9780253348302|pages=303–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Due to its inscription in time and its emphasis on bodily changes (through [[eating]], [[Defecation|evacuation]], and [[sex]]), the ''grotesque'' has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension of the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of laughter==
Bakhtin opens this work with a quotation from [[Alexander Herzen]]: "It would be extremely interesting to write the history of laughter".&lt;ref&gt;chap.1, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary expressions of the [[ancient world]]'s conceptions of laughter is the text that survives in the form of apocryphal letters of  [[Hippocrates]] about [[Democritus]] ([[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''Epistles'' 10–21).&lt;ref name="p.66-67"&gt;p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.&lt;ref name="p.66-67"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''rain-out model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|model]] of [[planetary science]] that describes the first stage of [[planetary differentiation]] and [[core (geology)|core]] formation. According to this model, a [[Planet|planetary body]] is assumed to be composed primarily of [[silicate mineral]]s and [[NiFe]] (i.e. a mixture of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]). If temperatures within this body reach about 1500&amp;nbsp;K, the minerals and the metals will melt. This will produce an [[emulsion]] in which globules of liquid NiFe are dispersed in a [[magma]] of liquid silicates, the two being [[immiscible]]. Because the NiFe globules are denser than the silicates, they will sink under the influence of gravity to the centre of the planetary body—in effect, the globules of metal will "rain out" from the emulsion to the centre, forming a core.

According to the rain-out model, core formation was a relatively rapid process, taking a few dozen millennia to reach completion. This occurred at the end of a lengthy process in which the planets were assembled from colliding [[planetary embryo]]s. Only the collisions of such large embryos could generate enough heat to melt entire bodies. Furthermore, it was only after all of the iron and nickel delivered by impacting bodies had arrived that core formation could proceed to completion.

However, this process of core formation was preceded by a long period of partial differentiation, in which some of the nickel and iron within the planetary embryos had begun to separate.

The rain-out model can be invoked to explain core formation in all the [[terrestrial planet]]s, given that these consist primarily of silicates, nickel and iron. It can also be adapted to account for core formation in smaller bodies composed of [[volatiles|ices]] and silicates. In such a case, it would be the denser silicates which would rain out to form a rocky core, while the volatile components would form an icy mantle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">'''Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) is a regional economic model developed and maintained by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Regional input-output multipliers such as the RIMS II multipliers allow estimates of how a one-time or sustained increase in economic activity in a particular region will impact other industries located in the region - i.e., estimating local shocks on gross output, value added, earnings, and employment. RIMS II multipliers differ from macro-economic multipliers, which are used to assess the effects of fiscal stimulus on gross national product. Differences in industry-specific regional multipliers are not meaningful, nor appropriate for use in a national context.

RIMS II allows for estimates at the regional level because the multipliers are based on BEA data at the national and regional level.

RIMS II multipliers have been used by both the public and private sectors. There are numerous examples of their use:

* Federal Government agencies have used the multipliers to study the local impact of government regulation on specific industries and to assess the local economic impacts of Federal actions such as military base closings.
* State and local governments have used the multipliers to estimate the regional economic impacts of government policies and projects and of events, such as firms locating within their state, or to assess the impacts of tourism.
* Businesses and private consultants have used the multipliers to estimate the economic impacts of a wide range of projects, such as building a new sports facility or expanding an airport; of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina; or of special events, such as national political conventions.

RIMS II provides six types of multipliers: final-demand multipliers for output, earnings, employment, and value added; and direct-effect multipliers for earnings and employment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The BEA introduced the RIMS tool in the early 1970s; an enhancement of the framework was completed in the 1980s, introducing RIMS II, which is the current framework.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, William M., US Department of Commerce. March 1997. "Regional Mutlipliers: A User Handbook for the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)". Available at https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/regional/perinc/meth/rims2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II framework is updated every few years with new data, depending on the resources available to the BEA. For example, after 2012, the BEA stopped releasing new updates to the multipliers. In 2015, the BEA began re-releasing the multipliers; they are generally released on an annual basis.

'''Data'''

The RIMS II framework currently encompasses multipliers for the "benchmark series". In past, the BEA also released an "annual series;" however, the annual series has been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/rimsii/|title=BEA RIMS II Online System|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iiusa.org/blog/rims-ii-regional-multipliers-updated-time-2012/|title=RIMS II Regional Multipliers Updated for First Time Since 2012|last=Kester|first=Michael|date=February 23, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II benchmark multiplier system is based national benchmark input-output data combined with regional data. Often, the national dataset is a few years behind the regional dataset.

A '''register file''' is an array of [[processor register]]s in a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Modern [[integrated circuit]]-based register files are usually implemented by way of fast [[static RAM]]s with multiple ports.  Such RAMs are distinguished by having dedicated read and write ports, whereas ordinary multiported SRAMs will usually read and write through the same ports.

The [[instruction set architecture]] of a CPU will almost always define a set of registers which are used to stage data between memory and the functional units on the chip.  In simpler CPUs, these ''architectural registers'' correspond one-for-one to the entries in a physical register file (PRF) within the CPU.  More complicated CPUs use [[register renaming]], so that the mapping of which physical entry stores a particular architectural register changes dynamically during execution.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/25858039/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Designing_and_Managing_CPU_Register_File A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing CPU Register File]", Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The register file is part of the [[instruction set architecture|architecture]] and visible to the programmer, as opposed to the concept of transparent [[CPU cache|caches]].

== Register bank switching ==
Register files may be clubbed together as register banks.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikibooks: Microprocessor Design/Register File#Register Bank]].
&lt;/ref&gt; Some processors have several register banks.

ARM processors use [[ARM architecture#Registers|ARM register banks]] for [[fast interrupt request]]. [[x86]] processors use context switching and fast interrupt for switching between instruction, decoder, GPRs and register files, if there is more than one, before the instruction is issued, but this is only existing on processors that support superscalar. However, context switching is a totally different mechanism to ARM's register bank within the registers.

The [[MODCOMP]] and the later [[Intel MCS-51#Registers|8051-compatible processors]] use bits in the program status word to select the currently active register bank.

== Implementation ==
[[Image:regfile array.png|right]]
The usual layout convention is that a simple array is read out vertically.  That is, a single word line, which runs horizontally, causes a row of [[bit cell]]s to put their data on bit lines, which run vertically.  [[Sense amplifier|Sense amps]], which convert low-swing read bitlines into full-swing logic levels, are usually at the bottom (by convention).  Larger register files are then sometimes constructed by tiling mirrored and rotated simple arrays.

Register files have one word line per entry per port, one bit line per bit of width per read port, and two bit lines per bit of width per write port.  Each bit cell also has a Vdd and Vss.  Therefore, the wire pitch area increases as the square of the number of ports, and the transistor area increases linearly.&lt;ref name="janssen" &gt;

p. 171-173.
&lt;/ref&gt;
At some point, it may be smaller and/or faster to have multiple redundant register files, with smaller numbers of read ports, rather than a single register file with all the read ports. The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R8000]]'s [[integer (computer science)|integer]] unit, for example, had a 9 read 4 write port 32 entry 64-bit register file implemented in a 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm process, which could be seen when looking at the chip from arm's length.

Two popular approaches to dividing registers into multiple register files are the distributed register file configuration and the partitioned register file configuration.&lt;ref name="janssen" /&gt;

In principle, any operation that could be done with a 64-bit-wide register file with many read and write ports could be done with a single 8-bit-wide register file with a single read port and a single write port. However, the [[bit-level parallelism]] of wide register files with many ports allows them to run much faster and thus, they can do operations in a single cycle that would take many cycles with fewer ports or a narrower bit width or both.&lt;ref name="cpurfreference"/&gt;

The width in bits of the register file is usually the number of bits in the [[Word (data type)|processor word size]].
Occasionally it is slightly wider in order to attach "extra" bits to each register, such as the poison bit.
If the width of the data word is different than the width of an address—or in some cases, such as the [[68000]], even when they are the same width—the address registers are in a separate register file than the data registers.

===Decoder===
* The decoder is often broken into pre-decoder and decoder proper.
* The decoder is a series of AND gates that drive word lines.
* There is one decoder per read or write port. If the array has four read and two write ports, for example, it has 6 word lines per bit cell in the array, and six AND gates per row in the decoder. Note that the decoder has to be pitch matched to the array, which forces those AND gates to be wide and short

===Array===
[[Image:regfile cell.png|right|frame| A typical register file -- "triple-ported", able to read from 2 registers and write to 1 register simultaneously -- is made of bit cells like this one.]]
The basic scheme for a bit cell:
* State is stored in pair of inverters. 
* Data is read out by nmos transistor to a bit line.
* Data is written by shorting one side or the other to ground through a two-nmos stack.
* So: read ports take one transistor per bit cell, write ports take four.
Many optimizations are possible:
* Sharing lines between cells, for example, Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines are often precharged to something between Vdd and Vss.
* Read bit lines often swing only a fraction of the way to Vdd or Vss.  A sense amplifier converts this small-swing signal into a full logic level.  Small swing signals are faster because the bit line has little drive but a great deal of parasitic capacitance.
* Write bit lines may be braided, so that they couple equally to the nearby read bitlines.  Because write bitlines are full swing, they can cause significant disturbances on read bitlines.
* If Vdd is a horizontal line, it can be switched off, by yet another decoder, if any of the write ports are writing that line during that cycle.  This optimization increases the speed of the write.
* Techniques that reduce the energy used by register files are useful in [[low-power electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Microarchitecture==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}{{Cleanup|section|reason=poor English|date=June 2016}}Most register files make no special provision to prevent multiple write ports from writing the same entry simultaneously.  Instead, the instruction scheduling hardware ensures that only one instruction in any particular cycle writes a particular entry. If multiple instructions targeting the same register are issued, all but one have their write enables turned off.

The crossed inverters take some finite time to settle after a write operation, during which a read operation will either take longer or return garbage.  It is common to have bypass multiplexers that bypass written data to the read ports when a simultaneous read and write to the same entry is commanded.  These bypass multiplexers are often part of a larger bypass network that forwards results which have not yet been committed between functional units.

The register file is usually pitch-matched to the [[datapath]] that it serves.  Pitch matching avoids having many busses passing over the datapath turn corners, which would use a lot of area.  But since every unit must have the same bit pitch, every unit in the datapath ends up with the bit pitch forced by the widest unit, which can waste area in the other units.  Register files, because they have two wires per bit per write port, and because all the bit lines must contact the silicon at every bit cell, can often set the pitch of a datapath.

Area can sometimes be saved, on machines with multiple units in a datapath, by having two datapaths side-by-side, each of which has smaller bit pitch than a single datapath would have.  This case usually forces multiple copies of a register file, one for each datapath.

The [[Alpha 21264]] (EV6), for instance,  was the first large micro-architecture to implement "Shadow Register File Architecture". It had two copies of the integer register file and two copies of floating point register that locate in its front end (future and scaled file, each contain 2 read and 2 write port), and took an extra cycle to propagate data between the two during context switch.  The issue logic attempted to reduce the number of operations forwarding data between the two and greatly improved its integer performance and help reduce the impact of limited number of GPR in superscalar and speculative execution. The design was later adapted by [[SPARC]], [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] and some later x86 implementation.

The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] uses multiple register file as well,  R8000 floating-point unit had two copies of the floating-point register file, each with four write and four read ports, and wrote both copies at the same time with context switch. However it does not support integer operation and integer register file still remain one. Later shadow register file was abandoned in newer design in favor of embedded market.

The [[SPARC]] uses "Shadow Register File Architecture" as well for its high end line, It had up to 4 copies of  integer register files (future, retired, scaled, scratched, each contain 7 read 4 write port) and 2 copies of floating point register file. but unlike Alpha and x86, they are locate in back end as retire unit right after its Out of Order Unit and renaming register files and do not load instruction during instruction fetch and decoding stage and context switch is needless in this design.

IBM uses the same mechanism as many major microprocessors, deeply merging the register file with the decoder but its register file are work independently by the decoder side and do not involve context switch, which is different from Alpha and x86. most of its register file not just serve for its dedicate decoder only but up to the thread level.  For example, [[POWER8]] has up to 8 instruction decoders, but up to 32 register files of 32 general purpose registers each (4 read and 4 write port), to facilitate [[simultaneous multithreading]], which its instruction cannot be used cross any other register file (lack of context switch.).

In the [[x86]] processor line, a typical pre-486 CPU did not have an individual register file, as all general purpose register were directly work with its decoder, and the x87 push stack was located within the floating-point unit itself. Starting with [[Pentium]], a typical Pentium-compatible x86 processor is integrated with one copy of the single-port architectural register file containing 8 architectural registers, 8 control registers, 8 debug registers, 8 condition code registers, 8 unnamed based register,{{clarify|date=September 2015}} one instruction pointer, one flag register and 6 segment registers in one file.

One copy of 8 x87 FP push down stack by default, [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] register were virtually simulated from x87 stack and require x86 register to supplying MMX instruction and aliases to exist stack. On P6, the instruction independently can be stored and executed in parallel in early pipeline stages before decoding into [[micro-operations]] and renaming in out-of-order execution. Beginning with [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], all register files do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, register files like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called "retire buffer", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the ring bus (16&amp;nbsp;bytes). The register file itself still remains one x86 register file and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing. Its x86 register file increased to dual ported to increase bandwidth for result storage. Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main register file and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer. Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose register file (except the instruction pointer); they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, in order to facilitate register renaming and out-of-order execution. The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point register file after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM register file is still located separately from x86 integer register files.

Later P6 implementations (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced "Shadow Register File Architecture" that expanded to 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&amp;retirered file and scaled file using the same trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, but it is still have 8 entries 32&amp;nbsp;bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called "register alias table" RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core 2]] increased the inner ring bus to 24&amp;nbsp;bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from dual ported (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 32&amp;nbsp;bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128&amp;nbsp;bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 write), register still remain 8 entries in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.

In later x86 implementations, like [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] and later processors, both integer and floating point registers are now incorporated into a unified octa-ported (six read and two write) general-purpose register file (8 + 8 in 32-bit and 16 + 16 in x64 per file), while the register file extended to 2 with enhanced "Shadow Register File Architecture" in favorite of executing [[hyper threading]] and each thread uses independent register files for its decoder. Later [[Sandy bridge]] and onward replaced shadow register table and architectural registers with much large and yet more advance physical register file before decoding to the reorder buffer. Randered that Sandy Bridge and onward no longer carry an architectural register.

On the [[Bonnell (microarchitecture)|Atom]] line was the modern simplified revision of P5. It includes single copies of register file share with thread and decoder. The register file is a dual-port design, 8/16 entries GPRS, 8/16 entries debug register and 8/16 entries condition code are integrated in the same file. However it has an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit shadow based register and an eight-entries 64&amp;nbsp;bit unnamed register that are now separated from main GPRs unlike the original P5 design and located after the execution unit, and the file of these registers is single-ported and not expose to instruction like scaled shadow register file found on Core/Core2 (shadow register file are made of architectural registers and Bonnell did not due to not have "Shadow Register File Architecture"), however the file can be use for renaming purpose due to lack of out of order execution found on Bonnell architecture. It also had one copy of XMM floating point register file per thread. The difference from [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] is Bonnell do not have a unified register file and has no dedicated register file for its hyper threading. Instead, Bonnell uses a separate rename register for its thread despite it is not out of order. Similar to Bonnell, [[Larrabee (microarchitecture)|Larrabee]] and [[Xeon Phi]] also each have only one general-purpose integer register file, but the Larrabee has up to 16 XMM register files (8 entries per file), and the Xeon Phi has up to 128 AVX-512 register files, each containing 32 512-bit ZMM registers for vector instruction storage, which can be as big as L2 cache.

There are some other of Intel's x86 lines that don't have a register file in their internal design, [[MediaGX|Geode GX]] and [[Vortex86]] and many embedded processors that aren't [[Pentium]]-compatible or reverse-engineered early 80x86 processors. Therefore, most of them don't have a register file for their decoders, but their GPRs are used individually. [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|Pentium 4]], on the other hand, does not have a register file for its decoder, as its x86 GPRs didn't exist within its structure, due to the introduction of a physical unified renaming register file (similar to Sandy Bridge, but slightly different due to the inability of Pentium 4 to use the register before naming) for attempting to replace the architectural register file and skip the x86 decoding scheme. Instead it uses SSE for integer execution and storage before the ALU and after result, SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 use the same mechanism as well for its integer operation.

[[AMD]]'s early design like K6 do not have a register file like Intel and do not support "Shadow Register File Architecture" as its lack of context switch and bypass inverter that are necessary require for a register file to function appropriately. Instead they use a separate GPRs that directly link to a rename register table for its OoOE CPU with a dedicated integer decoder and floating decoder. The mechanism is similar to Intel's pre-Pentium processor line. For example, the [[AMD K6|K6]] processor has four int (one eight-entries temporary scratched register file + one eight-entries future register file + one eight-entries fetched register file + an eight-entries unnamed register file) and two FP rename register files (two eight-entries x87 ST file one goes fadd and one goes fmov) that directly link with its x86 EAX for integer renaming and XMM0 register for floating point renaming, but later [[AMD K7|Athlon]] included "shadow register" in its front end, it's scaled up to 40 entries unified register file for in order integer operation before decoded, the register file contain 8 entries scratch register + 16 future GPRs register file + 16 unnamed GPRs register file. In later AMD designs it abandons the shadow register design and favored to K6 architecture with individual GPRs direct link design. Like [[AMD Phenom|Phenom]], it has three int register files and two SSE register files that are located in the physical register file directly linked with GPRs. However, it scales down to one integer + one floating-point on [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]. Like early AMD designs, most of the x86 manufacturers like Cyrix, VIA, DM&amp;P, and SIS used the same mechanism as well, resulting in a lack of integer performance without register renaming for their in-order CPU. Companies like Cyrix and AMD had to increase cache size in hope to reduce the bottleneck. AMD's SSE integer operation work in a different way than Core 2 and Pentium 4; it uses its separate renaming integer register to load the value directly before the decode stage. Though theoretically it will only need a shorter pipeline than Intel's SSE implementation, but generally the cost of branch prediction are much greater and higher missing rate than Intel, and it would have to take at least two cycles for its SSE instruction to be executed regardless of instruction wide, as early AMDs implementations could not execute both FP and Int in an SSE instruction set like Intel's implementation did.

Unlike [[Alpha 21264|Alpha]], [[Sparc]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] that only allows one register file to load/fetch one operand at the time; it would require multiple register files to achieve superscale. The [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor on the other hand does not integrate multiple register files to load/fetch instructions. ARM GPRs have no special purpose to the instruction set (the ARM ISA does not require accumulator, index, and stack/base points. Registers do not have an accumulator and base/stack point can only be used in thumb mode). Any GPRs can propagate and store multiple instructions independently in smaller code size that is small enough to be able to fit in one register and its architectural register act as a table and shared with all decoder/instructions with simple bank switching between decoders. The major difference between ARM and other designs is that ARM allows to run on the same general-purpose register with quick bank switching without requiring additional register file in superscalar. Despite x86 sharing the same mechanism with ARM that its GPRs can store any data individually, x86 will confront data dependency if more than three non-related instructions are stored, as its GPRs per file are too small (eight in 32&amp;nbsp;bit mode and 16 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit, compared to ARM's 13 in 32&amp;nbsp;bit and 31 in 64&amp;nbsp;bit) for data, and it is impossible to have superscalar without multiple register files to feed to its decoder (x86 code is big and complex compared to ARM). Because most x86's front-ends have become much larger and much more power hungry than the ARM processor in order to be competitive (example: Pentium M &amp; Core 2 Duo, Bay Trail). Some third-party x86 equivalent processors even became noncompetitive with ARM due to having no dedicated register file architecture. Particularly for AMD, Cyrix and VIA that cannot bring any reasonable performance without register renaming and out of order execution, which leave only Intel Atom to be the only in-order x86 processor core in the mobile competition. This was until the x86 Nehalem processor merged both of its integer and floating point register into one single file, and the introduction of a large physical register table and enhanced allocator table in its front-end before renaming in its out-of-order internal core.

== Register renaming ==
Processors that perform [[register renaming]] can arrange for each functional unit to write to a subset of the physical register file.  This arrangement can eliminate the need for multiple write ports per bit cell, for large savings in area.  The resulting register file, effectively a stack of register files with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports.  At the limit, this technique would place a stack of 1-write, 2-read regfiles at the inputs to each functional unit.  Since regfiles with a small number of ports are often dominated by transistor area, it is best not to push this technique to this limit, but it is useful all the same.

== Register windows ==
The [[SPARC]] ISA defines [[register window]]s, in which the 5-bit architectural names of the registers actually point into a window on a much larger register file, with hundreds of entries.  Implementing multiported register files with hundreds of entries requires a large area.  The register window slides by 16 registers when moved, so that each architectural register name can refer to only a small number of registers in the larger array, e.g. architectural register r20 can only refer to physical registers #20, #36, #52, #68, #84, #100, #116, if there are just seven windows in the physical file.

To save area, some SPARC implementations implement a 32-entry register file, in which each cell has seven "bits".  Only one is read and writeable through the external ports, but the contents of the bits can be rotated.  A rotation accomplishes in a single cycle a movement of the register window.  Because most of the wires accomplishing the state movement are local, tremendous bandwidth is possible with little power.

This same technique is used in the [[R10000]] register renaming mapping file, which stores a 6-bit virtual register number for each of the physical registers.  In the renaming file, the renaming state is checkpointed whenever a branch is taken, so that when a branch is detected to be mispredicted, the old renaming state can be recovered in a single cycle.  (See [[Register renaming]].)
&lt;!-- To do: R10K map file had lots of ports and few bits of width, and so it used a different layout, with bit lines running parallel to word lines, and state bits being global wires running perpendicularly. --&gt;

'''Scientific opinion on climate change''' is a judgment of scientists regarding the degree to which [[global warming]] is occurring, its likely causes, and its probable consequences. 

A related&amp;mdash;but not identical&amp;mdash;term, "scientific '''consensus''' on climate change," is the ''prevailing'' view on climate change within the scientific community. The consensus is that:
* Earth's climate has warmed significantly since the late 1800s, 
* Human activities (primarily [[greenhouse gas]] emissions) are the [[attribution of climate change|primary cause]], 
* Continuing emissions will increase the likelihood and severity of [[Effects of global warming|global effects]], and that
* People could manage future climate change impacts through intense efforts at [[Climate change mitigation|reducing further warming]] while [[Climate change adaptation|preparing for any unavoidable]] climate changes.

National and international [[Academy of Sciences|science academies]] and [[Learned society|scientific societies]] have assessed current [[scientific opinion]] on [[global warming]]. These assessments are generally consistent with the conclusions of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

Some scientific bodies have recommended specific policies to governments, and science can play a role in informing an effective response to climate change. Policy decisions, however, may require [[value judgement]]s and so are not included in the scientific opinion.&lt;ref name="tar value judgements"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC on policy"/&gt;

No scientific body of national or international standing maintains a formal opinion dissenting from any of these main points. The last national or international scientific body to drop dissent was the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]],&lt;ref name=AQAonAAPG/&gt; which in 2007&lt;ref name="aapg19"/&gt; updated its statement to its current non-committal position.&lt;ref name="Oreskes07p68"/&gt; Some other organizations, primarily those focusing on geology, also hold [[#Non-committal|non-committal positions]].

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014 ===
{{main article|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC Fifth Assessment Report}}

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report followed the same general format as the Fourth Assessment Report, with three Working Group reports and a Synthesis report.&lt;ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/&gt; The Working Group I report (WG1) was published in September 2013.&lt;ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/&gt; The report's ''Summary for Policymakers'' stated that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal' with changes unprecedented over decades to millennia, including warming of the atmosphere and oceans, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|loss of snow and ice]], and [[sea level rise]]. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, driven largely by economic and population growth, have led to greenhouse gas concentrations that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. These, together with other anthropogenic drivers, are "extremely likely" to have been the dominant cause of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=IPCC-AR5-SYN&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It said that
{{quote|Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.&lt;ref name=IPCC-AR5-SYN/&gt;}}

Reporting on the publication of the report, ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that
{{quote|In the end it all boils down to risk management. The stronger our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the lower the risk of extreme climate impacts. The higher our emissions, the larger climate changes we'll face, which also means more expensive adaptation, more species extinctions, more food and water insecurities, more income losses, more conflicts, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nuccitelli|first1=Dana|title=IPCC report warns of future climate change risks, but is spun by contrarians|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/31/ipcc-warns-climate-change-risks|accessdate=1 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It went on to say that [[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[United Nations]] secretary general, had declared his intention to call a meeting of heads of state in 2014 to develop such a treaty.

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 ===
In February 2007, the IPCC released a summary of the forthcoming [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]]. According to this summary, the Fourth Assessment Report found that human actions are "very likely" the cause of global warming, meaning a 90% or greater probability. Global warming in this case was indicated by an increase of 0.75 degrees in average global temperatures over the last 100 years.&lt;ref name="Warming 'very likely' human-made"/&gt;

The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] stated that:
* Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in global average air and ocean [[instrumental temperature record|temperatures]], the widespread melting of [[snow]] and [[ice]], and rising global average [[current sea level rise|sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=1.

''The New York Times'' reported that "the leading international network of climate scientists has concluded for the first time that global warming is 'unequivocal' and that human activity is the main driver, 'very likely' causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950".&lt;ref name="rosenthal"/&gt;

A retired journalist for ''The New York Times'', William K. Stevens wrote: "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's parlance, this level of certainty is labeled 'very likely'. Only rarely does scientific odds-making provide a more definite answer than that, at least in this branch of science, and it describes the endpoint, so far, of a progression.".&lt;ref name="On the Climate Change Beat, Doubt Gives Way to Certainty"/&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] summarized the position on sea level rise:

The two-part report by the [[United States Global Change Research Program]] (USGCRP) was the result of two years of work by a team from 13 federal agencies with [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) as the lead administrator.

====Background==== 



:''Formerly: [[Climate Change Science Program]]''

The [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] reported in June 2009&lt;ref name="globalchange"/&gt; that:

{{quote|Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.}}

The 2009 report, which is about the effects that climate change is having in the United States, also said:

{{quote|Climate-related changes have already been observed globally and in the United States. These include increases in air and water temperatures, reduced frost days, increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours, a rise in sea level, and reduced snow cover, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. A longer ice-free period on lakes and rivers, lengthening of the growing season, and increased [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere have also been observed. Over the past 30 years, temperatures have risen faster in winter than in any other season, with average winter temperatures in the Midwest and northern Great Plains increasing more than {{convert|7|F-change|C-change}}. Some of the changes have been faster than previous assessments had suggested.}}

=== Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ===
In 2004, the intergovernmental [[Arctic Council]] and the non-governmental [[International Arctic Science Committee]] released the synthesis report of the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]]:&lt;ref name="Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment New Scientific Consensus: Arctic Is Warming Rapidly"/&gt;

{{quote|Climate conditions in the past provide evidence that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are associated with rising global temperatures. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping ("greenhouse") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.&lt;ref name="amap"/&gt;}}

== Policy ==
{{See also|Avoiding dangerous climate change}}

There is an extensive discussion in the [[scientific literature]] on what policies might be effective in responding to climate change.&lt;ref name="ar4 policy assessment"&gt;The literature has been assessed by the IPCC, e.g., see:

&lt;/ref&gt; However, policy decisions may require [[value judgement]]s.&lt;ref name="tar value judgements"/&gt; For example, the [[US National Research Council]] has commented:&lt;ref name="NRC on policy"&gt;
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10139&amp;page=4 Summary], in {{harvnb|US NRC|2001|p=4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of whether there exists a "safe" level of concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be answered directly because it would require a value judgment of what constitutes an acceptable risk to human welfare and ecosystems in various parts of the world, as well as a more quantitative assessment of the risks and costs associated with the various impacts of global warming. In general, however, risk increases with increases in both the rate and the magnitude of climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Concurring ===

==== Academies of science (general science) ====
Since 2001, 34 [[national academies|national science academies]], three regional academies, and both the international [[InterAcademy Council]] and [[International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences]] have made formal declarations confirming human induced global warming and urging nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The 34 national science academy statements include 33 who have signed joint science academy statements and one individual declaration by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in 2007.

===== Joint national science academy statements =====
* 2001 Following the publication of the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled "The Science of Climate Change", explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. The statement, printed in an editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on May 18, 2001,&lt;ref name="Editorial: The Science of Climate Change"/&gt; was signed by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/&gt;
* 2005 The national science academies of the [[G8]] nations, plus Brazil, China and India, three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world, signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action, and explicitly endorsed the IPCC consensus. The eleven signatories were the science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies"/&gt;
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the national science academies of the [[G8+5]] nations issued a declaration referencing the position of the 2005 joint science academies' statement, and acknowledging the confirmation of their previous conclusion by recent research. Following the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], the declaration states, "It is unequivocal that the climate is changing, and it is very likely that this is predominantly caused by the increasing human interference with the atmosphere. These changes will transform the environmental conditions on [[Earth]] unless counter-measures are taken." The thirteen signatories were the national science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="pik-potsdam"/&gt;
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the [[Network of African Science Academies]] submitted a joint "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change" : {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. | The thirteen signatories were the science academies of [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], as well as the [[African Academy of Sciences]] | &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}
* 2008 In preparation for the [[34th G8 summit]], the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a declaration reiterating the position of the 2005 joint science academies’ statement, and reaffirming "that climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems." Among other actions, the declaration urges all nations to "(t)ake appropriate economic and policy measures to accelerate transition to a [[low carbon society]] and to encourage and effect changes in individual and national behaviour." The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 joint statement.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies5"/&gt;
* 2009 In advance of the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UNFCCC]] negotiations to be held in [[Copenhagen]] in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, "Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change". The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that "climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global {{CO2}} emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid." The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies6"/&gt;

===== Polish Academy of Sciences =====
In December 2007, the General Assembly of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (Polska Akademia Nauk), which has not been a signatory to [[#Joint National Science Academy Statements|joint national science academy statements]] issued a declaration endorsing the IPCC conclusions, and stating:
{{quote|it is the duty of Polish science and the national government to, in a thoughtful, organized and active manner, become involved in realisation of these ideas.

Problems of global warming, climate change, and their various negative impacts on human life and on the functioning of entire societies are one of the most dramatic challenges of modern times.

PAS General Assembly calls on the national scientific communities and the national government to actively support Polish participation in this important endeavor.&lt;ref name="Stanowisko Zgromadzenia Ogólnego PAN z dnia 13 grudnia 2007 r"/&gt;}}

===== Additional national science academy and society statements =====
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] as the world's largest general scientific society, adopted an official statement on climate change in 2006: {{quote|The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society....The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.&lt;ref name="aaas board"/&gt;}}
* [[Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies]] in 2008 published ''FASTS Statement on Climate Change''&lt;ref name="FASTS Statement on Climate Change"/&gt; which states: {{quote|Global climate change is real and measurable...To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses in the face of these impacts, the policy objective must remain squarely focused on returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions. The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity.}}
* [[United States National Research Council]] through its Committee on the Science of Climate Change in 2001, published ''Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions''.&lt;ref name="CCSAASKQ"&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on the Science of Climate Change, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National Research Council |title=Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington DC |year=2001 |isbn=0-309-07574-2 |url=http://books.nap.edu/html/climatechange |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010628070322/http://books.nap.edu/html/climatechange/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This report explicitly endorses the IPCC view of attribution of recent climate change as representing the view of the scientific community: {{quote|The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are expected to continue through the 21st century... The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue.&lt;ref name="CCSAASKQ"/&gt;}}
* [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] having signed onto the first joint science academy statement in 2001, released a separate statement in 2008 in order to clear up "the controversy over climate change and its causes, and possible confusion among the public": {{quote|The globe is warming because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Measurements show that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are well above levels seen for many thousands of years. Further global climate changes are predicted, with impacts expected to become more costly as time progresses. Reducing future impacts of climate change will require substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Climate change statement from the Royal Society of New Zealand"/&gt;}}
* The [[Royal Society]] of the United Kingdom has not changed its concurring stance reflected in its participation in [[#Joint national science academies' statements|joint national science academies' statements]] on anthropogenic global warming. According to the [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]], "The most prestigious group of scientists in the country was forced to act after fellows complained that doubts over man made global warming were not being communicated to the public".&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; In May 2010, it announced that it "is presently drafting a new public facing document on climate change, to provide an updated status report on the science in an easily accessible form, also addressing the levels of certainty of key components."&lt;ref name="RS-CC"/&gt; The society says that it is three years since the last such document was published and that, after an extensive process of debate and review,&lt;ref name="Society to review climate message"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Some excitable climate-change deniers just don't understand what science is"/&gt; the new document was printed in September 2010. It summarises the current scientific evidence and highlights the areas where the science is well established, where there is still some debate, and where substantial uncertainties remain. The society has stated that "this is not the same as saying that the climate science itself is in error – no Fellows have expressed such a view to the RS".&lt;ref name="RS-CC"/&gt;  The introduction includes this statement: {{quote|There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.}}

===== International science academies =====
* [[African Academy of Sciences]] in 2007 was a signatory to the "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change". This joint statement of African science academies, was organized through the [[Network of African Science Academies]]. Its stated goal was "to convey information and spur action on the occasion of the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, in June 2007". {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability,  energy efficiency and climate change|url=http://www.interacademies.net/file.aspx?id=4825|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=2007|quote=A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change... Although we recognize that this nexus poses daunting challenges for the developed world, we firmly believe that these challenges are even more daunting for the most impoverished, science-poor regions of the developing world, especially in Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2007 issued a formal declaration on climate change titled ''Let's Be Honest'': {{quote|Human activity is most ''likely'' responsible for climate warming. Most of the climatic warming over the last 50 years is ''likely'' to have been caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Documented long-term climate changes include changes in Arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and [[extreme weather]] including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones. The above development potentially has dramatic consequences for mankind's future.&lt;ref name="euro-acad"/&gt;}}
* [[European Science Foundation]] in a 2007 position paper &lt;ref name="European Science Foundation Position Paper ''Impacts of Climate Change on the European Marine and Coastal Environment — Ecosystems Approach''"/&gt; states: {{quote|There is now convincing evidence that since the industrial revolution, human activities, resulting in increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have become a major agent of climate change... On-going and increased efforts to mitigate climate change through reduction in greenhouse gases are therefore crucial.}}
* [[InterAcademy Council]] As the representative of the world's [[Academy of Sciences|scientific and engineering academies]],&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interacademycouncil"/&gt; the InterAcademy Council issued a report in 2007 titled ''Lighting the Way: Toward a Sustainable Energy Future''. {{quote|Current patterns of energy resources and energy usage are proving detrimental to the long-term welfare of humanity. The integrity of essential natural systems is already at risk from climate change caused by the atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="interacademycouncil7"/&gt; Concerted efforts should be mounted for improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon intensity of the world economy.&lt;ref name="interacademycouncil8"/&gt;}}
* [[International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences]] (CAETS) in 2007, issued a ''Statement on Environment and Sustainable Growth'':&lt;ref name="caets"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caets.org/nae/naecaets.nsf/(weblinks)/WSAN-78QL9A?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210053304/http://www.caets.org/nae/naecaets.nsf/(weblinks)/WSAN-78QL9A?OpenDocument |archivedate=2008-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|As reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century is very likely due to human-produced emission of greenhouse gases and this warming will continue unabated if present anthropogenic emissions continue or, worse, expand without control. CAETS, therefore, endorses the many recent calls to decrease and control greenhouse gas emissions to an acceptable level as quickly as possible.}}

===== American Geophysical Union =====
The [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) adopted a statement on ''Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tamara S. |last=Ledley |first2=Eric T. |last2=Sundquist |first3=Stephen E. |last3=Schwartz |first4=Dorothy K. |last4=Hall |first5=Jack D. |last5=Fellows |first6=Timothy L. |last6=Killeen |title=Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases |journal=EOS |date=September 28, 1999 |volume=80 |issue=39 |pages=453–454, 457–458 |doi=10.1029/99EO00325 |quote=There is no known geologic precedent for large increases of atmospheric C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without simultaneous changes in other components of the carbon cycle and climate system.[...] Changes in the climate system that are confidently predicted in response to increases in greenhouse gases include increases in mean surface air temperature, increases in global mean rates of precipitation and evaporation, rising sea level, and changes in the biosphere. |url=http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2016 |bibcode=1999EOSTr..80Q.453L |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000325/http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new statement, adopted by the society in 2003, revised in 2007,&lt;ref name="agu"/&gt; and revised and expanded in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human-induced Climate Change Requires Urgent Action|url=http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2013/2013-38.shtml|work=Position Statement|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirms that rising levels of greenhouse gases have caused and will continue to cause the global surface temperature to be warmer:

{{quote|Human activities are changing Earth's climate. At the global level, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel burning dominates this increase. Human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8{{nnbsp}}°C (1.5{{nnbsp}}°F) over the past 140 years. Because natural processes cannot quickly remove some of these gases (notably carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere, our past, present, and future emissions will influence the climate system for millennia.

While important scientific uncertainties remain as to which particular impacts will be experienced where, no uncertainties are known that could make the impacts of climate change inconsequential. Furthermore, surprise outcomes, such as the unexpectedly rapid loss of Arctic summer sea ice, may entail even more dramatic changes than anticipated.}}

===== American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America =====
In May, 2011, the [[American Society of Agronomy]] (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and [[Soil Science Society of America]] (SSSA) issued a joint position statement on climate change as it relates to agriculture:

{{quote|A comprehensive body of scientific evidence indicates beyond reasonable doubt that global climate change is now occurring and that its manifestations threaten the stability of societies as well as natural and managed ecosystems. Increases in ambient temperatures and changes in related processes are directly linked to rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere.

Unless the emissions of GHGs are curbed significantly, their concentrations will continue to rise, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables that will undoubtedly affect agriculture around the world.

Climate change has the potential to increase weather variability as well as gradually increase global temperatures. Both of these impacts have the potential to negatively impact the adaptability and resilience of the world's food production capacity; current research indicates climate change is already reducing the productivity of vulnerable cropping systems.&lt;ref name="soils"/&gt;}}

===== European Federation of Geologists =====
In 2008, the European Federation of Geologists&lt;ref name="eurogeologists"/&gt; (EFG) issued the position paper ''Carbon Capture and geological Storage '':

{{quote|The EFG recognizes the work of the IPCC and other organizations, and subscribes to the major findings that climate change is happening, is predominantly caused by anthropogenic emissions of {{CO2}}, and poses a significant threat to human civilization.

It is clear that major efforts are necessary to quickly and strongly reduce {{CO2}} emissions. The EFG strongly advocates renewable and sustainable energy production, including geothermal energy, as well as the need for increasing energy efficiency.

CCS [Carbon Capture and geological Storage] should also be regarded as a bridging technology, facilitating the move towards a carbon free economy.&lt;ref name="eurogeologists9"/&gt;}}

===== European Geosciences Union =====
In 2005, the Divisions of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the [[European Geosciences Union]] (EGU) issued a position statement in support of the [[scientific opinion on climate change#Joint science academies’ statement 2005|joint science academies’ statement]] on global response to climate change. The statement refers to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), as "the main representative of the global [[scientific community]]", and asserts that the IPCC

{{quote|represents the state-of-the-art of climate science supported by the major science academies around the world and by the vast majority of science researchers and investigators as documented by the [[peer-reviewed]] scientific literature.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;}}

Additionally, in 2008, the EGU issued a position statement on [[ocean acidification]] which states, "Ocean acidification is already occurring today and will continue to intensify, closely tracking [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric {{CO2}}]] increase. Given the potential threat to [[marine ecosystems]] and its ensuing impact on human society and economy, especially as it acts in conjunction with [[anthropogenic global warming]], there is an urgent need for immediate action." The statement then advocates for strategies "to limit future release of {{CO2}} to the atmosphere and/or enhance removal of excess {{CO2}} from the atmosphere."&lt;ref name="www10"/&gt;

===== Geological Society of America =====
In 2006, the [[Geological Society of America]] adopted a position statement on global [[climate change]]. It amended this position on April 20, 2010 with more explicit comments on need for {{CO2}} reduction.
{{quote|Decades of scientific research have shown that climate can change from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s. If current trends continue, the projected increase in global temperature by the end of the twenty first century will result in large impacts on humans and other species. Addressing the challenges posed by climate change will require a combination of adaptation to the changes that are likely to occur and global reductions of {{CO2}} emissions from anthropogenic sources.&lt;ref name="geosociety"/&gt;}}

===== Geological Society of London =====
In November 2010, the [[Geological Society of London]] issued the position statement ''Climate change: evidence from the geological record'':

{{quote|The last century has seen a rapidly growing global population and much more intensive use of resources, leading to greatly increased emissions of gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal), and from agriculture, cement production and deforestation. Evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater.

There is now widespread concern that the Earth's climate will warm further, not only because of the lingering effects of the added carbon already in the system, but also because of further additions as human population continues to grow. Life on Earth has survived large climate changes in the past, but extinctions and major redistribution of species have been associated with many of them. When the human population was small and nomadic, a rise in sea level of a few metres would have had very little effect on Homo sapiens. With the current and growing global population, much of which is concentrated in coastal cities, such a rise in sea level would have a drastic effect on our complex society, especially if the climate were to change as suddenly as it has at times in the past. Equally, it seems likely that as warming continues some areas may experience less precipitation leading to drought. With both rising seas and increasing drought, pressure for human migration could result on a large scale.&lt;ref name="geolsoc"/&gt;}}

===== International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics =====
In July 2007, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) adopted a resolution titled "The Urgency of Addressing Climate Change". In it, the IUGG concurs with the "comprehensive and widely accepted and endorsed scientific assessments carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and regional and national bodies, which have firmly established, on the basis of scientific evidence, that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change." They state further that the "continuing reliance on combustion of fossil fuels as the world's primary source of energy will lead to much higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which will, in turn, cause significant increases in surface temperature, sea level, ocean acidification, and their related consequences to the environment and society."&lt;ref name="iugg"/&gt;

===== National Association of Geoscience Teachers =====
In July 2009, the National Association of Geoscience Teachers&lt;ref name="nagt"/&gt; (NAGT) adopted a position statement on climate change in which they assert that "Earth's climate is changing [and] "that present warming trends are largely the result of human activities":

{{quote|NAGT strongly supports and will work to promote education in the science of climate change, the causes and effects of current global warming, and the immediate need for policies and actions that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="nagt11"/&gt;}}

==== Meteorology and oceanography ====

===== American Meteorological Society =====
The [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) statement adopted by their council in 2012 concluded:

{{quote|There is unequivocal evidence that Earth's lower atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are warming; sea level is rising; and snow cover, mountain glaciers, and Arctic sea ice are shrinking. The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. This scientific finding is based on a large and persuasive body of research. The observed warming will be irreversible for many years into the future, and even larger temperature increases will occur as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Avoiding this future warming will require a large and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing warming will increase risks and stresses to human societies, economies, ecosystems, and wildlife through the 21st century and beyond, making it imperative that society respond to a changing climate. To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research. This is especially true for smaller (seasonal and regional) scales and weather and climate extremes, and for important hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and water availability.

Technological, economic, and policy choices in the near future will determine the extent of future impacts of climate change. Science-based decisions are seldom made in a context of absolute certainty. National and international policy discussions should include consideration of the best ways to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mitigation will reduce the amount of future climate change and the risk of impacts that are potentially large and dangerous. At the same time, some continued climate change is inevitable, and policy responses should include adaptation to climate change. Prudence dictates extreme care in accounting for our relationship with the only planet known to be capable of sustaining human life.&lt;ref name="ametsoc"/&gt;}}

===== Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
The [[Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude:

{{quote|Global climate change and global warming are real and observable ... It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 30% since the start of the industrial age and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity."&lt;ref name="amos"/&gt;}}

===== Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences =====
In November 2005, the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences]] (CFCAS) issued a letter to the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] stating that

{{quote|We concur with the climate science assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 ... We endorse the conclusions of the IPCC assessment that 'There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities'. ... There is increasingly unambiguous evidence of changing climate in Canada and around the world. There will be increasing impacts of climate change on Canada's natural ecosystems and on our socio-economic activities. Advances in climate science since the 2001 IPCC Assessment have provided more evidence supporting the need for action and development of a strategy for adaptation to projected changes.&lt;ref name="cfcas"/&gt;}}

===== Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
In November 2009,  a letter to the Canadian Parliament by The [[Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] states:
{{quote|Rigorous international research, including work carried out and supported by the Government of Canada, reveals that greenhouse gases resulting from human activities contribute to the warming of the atmosphere and the oceans and constitute a serious risk to the health and safety of our society, as well as having an impact on all life.&lt;ref name="cmos"/&gt;}}

===== Royal Meteorological Society (UK) =====
In February 2007, after the release of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] issued an endorsement of the report. In addition to referring to the IPCC as "[the] world's best climate scientists", they stated that climate change is happening as "the result of emissions since industrialization and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get."&lt;ref name="rmets"/&gt;

===== World Meteorological Organization =====
In its ''Statement at the Twelfth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change'' presented on November 15, 2006, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) confirms the need to "[[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]]." The WMO concurs that "scientific assessments have increasingly reaffirmed that human activities are indeed changing the composition of the atmosphere, in particular through the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation." The WMO concurs that "the present atmospheric concentration of {{CO2}} was never exceeded over the past 420,000 years;" and that the IPCC "assessments provide the most authoritative, up-to-date scientific advice."
&lt;ref name="www12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/mediacentre/statann/documents/SG21_2006_E.pdf|title=WMO's Statement at the Twelfth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== American Quaternary Association =====
The [[American Quaternary Association]] (AMQUA) has stated

{{quote|Few credible Scientists now doubt that humans have influenced the documented rise of global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution," citing "the growing body of evidence that warming of the atmosphere, especially over the past 50 years, is directly impacted by human activity.&lt;ref name="agu13"/&gt;}}

The statement on climate change issued by the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA) reiterates the conclusions of the IPCC, and urges all nations to take prompt action in line with the [[UNFCCC]] principles.

{{quote|Human activities are now causing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, and nitrous oxide — to rise well above pre-industrial levels….Increases in greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise…The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action….Minimizing the amount of this carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere presents a huge challenge but must be a global priority.&lt;ref name="inqua"/&gt;}}

{{quote|There is now widespread agreement that the Earth is warming, due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. It is also clear that current trends in energy use, development, and population growth will lead to continuing – and more severe – climate change.}}

{{quote|The changing climate will inevitably affect the basic requirements for maintaining health: clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter. Each year, about 800,000 people die from causes attributable to [[urban air pollution]], 1.8 million from [[diarrhoea]] resulting from lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation, and poor hygiene, 3.5 million from [[malnutrition]] and approximately 60,000 in natural disasters. A warmer and more variable climate threatens to lead to higher levels of some air pollutants, increase transmission of diseases through unclean water and through contaminated food, to compromise agricultural production in some of the least developed countries, and increase the hazards of extreme weather.}}

==== American Association of Petroleum Geologists ====
As of June 2007, the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] (AAPG) Position Statement on climate change stated:

{{quote|the AAPG membership is divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic {{CO2}} has on recent and potential global temperature increases ... Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS and AMS. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models.&lt;ref name="aapg"/&gt;}}

Prior to the adoption of this statement, the AAPG was the only major scientific organization that rejected the finding of significant human influence on recent climate, according to a statement by the Council of the American Quaternary Association.&lt;ref name="AQAonAAPG"/&gt; Explaining the plan for a revision, AAPG president Lee Billingsly wrote in March 2007:

{{quote|Members have threatened to not renew their memberships… if AAPG does not alter its position on global climate change... And I have been told of members who already have resigned in previous years because of our current global climate change position… The current policy statement is not supported by a significant number of our members and prospective members.&lt;ref name="aapg14"/&gt;}}

AAPG President John Lorenz announced the "sunsetting" of AAPG's Global Climate Change Committee in January 2010.  The AAPG Executive Committee determined:

{{quote|Climate change is peripheral at best to our science […] AAPG does not have credibility in that field […] and as a group we have no particular knowledge of global atmospheric geophysics.&lt;ref name="2010_tpgmarapr"/&gt;}}

==== American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) ====
The official position statement from AIPG on the Environment states that "combustion of fossil fuel include and the generation of GHGs [greenhouse gases] including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).  Emissions of GHGs are perceived by some to be one of the largest, global environmental concerns related to energy production due to potential effects on the global energy system and possibly global climate. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of GHGs since industrialization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AIPG Position Statements |url=http://aipg.org/posstatements |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, AIPG's Executive Director issued a statement regarding polarization of opinions on climate change within the membership and announced that the AIPG Executive had made a decision to cease publication of articles and opinion pieces concerning climate change in AIPG's news journal, ''The Professional Geologist''.&lt;ref name="aipg17"/&gt;

Various surveys have been conducted to evaluate scientific opinion on [[global warming]]. They have concluded that the majority of scientists support the idea of anthropogenic climate change.

In 2004, the geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change"/&gt; She analyzed 928 [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of [[anthropogenic climate change]].

Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Seventy-five per cent of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories (either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view); 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. None of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

In 2007, [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years; 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that "currently available scientific evidence" substantiated its occurrence. Catastrophic effects in 50–100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger. 5% said they thought human activity did not contribute to greenhouse warming.&lt;ref name="Survey Tracks Scientists' Growing Climate Concern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Scientists Agree on Warming, Disagree on Dangers, and Don't Trust the Media's Coverage of Climate Change"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lichter |first=S.

Dennis Bray and [[Hans von Storch]] conducted a survey in August 2008 of 2058 climate scientists from 34 different countries.&lt;ref name="A Survey of the Perspectives of Climate Scientists Concerning Climate Science and Climate Change"/&gt; A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 373 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18.2%. No paper on climate change consensus based on this survey has been published yet (February 2010), but one on another subject has been published based on the survey.&lt;ref name="Prediction' or 'Projection; The nomenclature of climate science"/&gt;

The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections.
There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public.
Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.

To the question "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?", 67.1% said they very much agreed, 26.7% agreed to some large extent, 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2–4), none said they did not agree at all. To the question "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will
be, a result of anthropogenic causes?" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.

A poll performed by [[Peter Doran]] and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 [[climatologists]] who "listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Seventy-five of 77 believed that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. [[Economic geologist]]s and [[meteorologist]]s were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement. The authors summarised the findings:

{{quote|It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.&lt;ref name="DZ_EOS_2009"/&gt;}}

A 2010 paper in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States'']] (PNAS) reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers and drew the following two conclusions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.&lt;ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2013 paper in [[Environmental Research Letters]] reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching "global warming" or "global climate change". They found 4,014 which discussed the cause of recent global warming, and of these "97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming".&lt;ref name="Cook_etal_13"/&gt; This study was criticised by [[Richard Tol]].&lt;ref name="Tol p=048001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tol | first=Richard S J | title=Comment on ‘Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature’ | journal=Environmental Research Letters | publisher=IOP Publishing | volume=11 | issue=4 | date=1 April 2016 | issn=1748-9326 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001 | page=048001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James L. Powell]], a former member of the [[National Science Board]] and current executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]], analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24 rejected anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plait|first=P.|date=11 December 2012|title=Why Climate Change Denial Is Just Hot Air|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/11/climate_change_denial_why_don_t_they_publish_scientific_papers.html|newspaper=Slate|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed climate articles with 9,136 authors published between November 2012 and December 2013 revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plait|first=P.|date=14 January 2014|title=The Very, Very Thin Wedge of Denial|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/01/14/climate_change_another_study_shows_they_don_t_publish_actual_papers.html|newspaper=Slate|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2015 paper on the topic, covering 24,210 articles published by 69,406 authors during 2013 and 2014 found only five articles by four authors rejecting anthropogenic global warming. Over 99.99% of climate scientists did not reject AGW in their peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref name=Powell2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=James Lawrence|title=Climate Scientists Virtually Unanimous Anthropogenic Global Warming Is True|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|date=1 October 2015|volume=35|issue=5–6|pages=121–124|doi=10.1177/0270467616634958|url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/35/5-6/121|language=en|issn=0270-4676}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming, 2017.jpg|thumb|Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming.]]
In his latest paper, Powell reported that using rejection as the criterion of consensus, five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015, including several of those above, combine to 54,195 articles with an average consensus of 99.94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=James Lawrence|date=2017-05-24|title=The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming Matters|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1177/0270467617707079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replication studies have shown that the 2% of climate science papers that rejected the scientific consensus on climate change in 2016 were methodologically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning from mistakes in climate research|first1=Rasmus E.|last1=Benestad|first2=Dana|last2=Nuccitelli|first3=Stephan|last3=Lewandowsky|first4=Katharine|last4=Hayhoe|first5=Hans Olav|last5=Hygen|first6=Rob van|last6=Dorland|first7=John|last7=Cook|date=1 November 2016|journal=Theoretical and Applied Climatology|volume=126|issue=3–4|pages=699–703|doi=10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5|bibcode=2016ThApC.126..699B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Existence of a scientific consensus ==
{{See also|Scientific consensus}}
A question that frequently arises in popular discussion of climate change is whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref name="Oreskes_consensus"/&gt;  Several scientific organizations have explicitly used the term "consensus" in their statements:
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 2006: "The conclusions in this statement reflect the scientific consensus represented by, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the Joint National Academies' statement."&lt;ref name="aaas board"/&gt;
* [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]]: "In the judgment of most climate scientists, Earth's warming in recent decades has been caused primarily by human activities that have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ... On climate change, [the National Academies’ reports] have assessed consensus findings on the science..."&lt;ref name="nas"/&gt;
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2005: "We recognise the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."&lt;ref name="nationalacademies21"/&gt;
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2001: "The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science. We recognise IPCC as the world's most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus."&lt;ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/&gt;
* [[American Meteorological Society]], 2003: "The nature of science is such that there is rarely total agreement among scientists. Individual scientific statements and papers—the validity of some of which has yet to be assessed adequately—can be exploited in the policy debate and can leave the impression that the scientific community is sharply divided on issues where there is, in reality, a strong scientific consensus.... IPCC assessment reports are prepared at approximately five-year intervals by a large international group of experts who represent the broad range of expertise and perspectives relevant to the issues. The reports strive to reflect a consensus evaluation of the results of the full body of peer-reviewed research.... They provide an analysis of what is known and not known, the degree of consensus, and some indication of the degree of confidence that can be placed on the various statements and conclusions."&lt;ref name="ametsoc22"/&gt;
* [[Network of African Science Academies]]: "A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* [[International Union for Quaternary Research]], 2008: "INQUA recognizes the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."&lt;ref name="inqua"/&gt;
* Australian Coral Reef Society,&lt;ref name="australiancoralreefsociety"/&gt; 2006: "There is almost total consensus among experts that the earth's climate is changing as a result of the build-up of greenhouse gases.... There is broad scientific consensus that coral reefs are heavily affected by the activities of man and there are significant global influences that can make reefs more vulnerable such as global warming...."&lt;ref name="australiancoralreefsociety24"/&gt;

Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are very likely (&gt;90% probability) to be the main cause of this warming. Climate-sensitive changes in ecosystems are already being observed, and fundamental, potentially irreversible, ecological changes may occur in the coming decades. Conservative environmental estimates of the impact of climate changes that are already in process indicate that they will result in numerous health effects to children.  Anticipated direct health consequences of climate change include injury and death from [[extreme weather events]] and [[natural disasters]], increases in climate-sensitive [[infectious diseases]], increases in [[Air Pollutions Effect on Pulmonary diseases and Children|air pollution–related illness]], and more heat-related, potentially fatal, illness.

While ‘climate change’ can be due to natural forces or human activity, there is now substantial evidence to indicate that human activity – and specifically increased greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions – is a key factor in the pace and extent of global temperature increases.  Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, [[Heat wave|heatwaves]] and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the [[Food security|food]] and [[water supply]], resource conflicts and population shifts.  Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[Ross River virus]] and food-borne infections such as [[Salmonellosis]]) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little room for doubt that observed climate trends are due to human activities. The threats are serious and action is urgently needed to mitigate the risks of climate change.  The reality of global warming, its current serious and potentially disastrous impacts on Earth system properties, and the key role emissions from human activities play in driving these phenomena have been recognized by earlier versions of this ACS policy statement (ACS, 2004), by other major scientific societies, including the American Geophysical Union (AGU, 2003), the American Meteorological Society (AMS, 2007) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2007), and by the U.

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes.  The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth's physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.  Because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult, the APS urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the Earth's climate, and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms. The APS also urges governments, universities, national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.&lt;/ref&gt;

These greenhouse gases affect the global climate by retaining heat in the troposphere, thus raising the average temperature of the planet and altering global atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns.  While on-going national and international actions to curtail and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are essential, the levels of greenhouse gases currently in the atmosphere, and their impact, are likely to persist for several decades.

Since the start of the 20th century, the global mean surface temperature of the Earth has increased by more than 0.7°C and the rate of warming has been largest in the last 30 years.  Key vulnerabilities arising from climate change include water resources, food supply, health, coastal settlements, biodiversity and some key [[ecosystems]] such as coral reefs and alpine regions. As the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases increases, impacts become more severe and widespread. To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses in the face of these impacts, the policy objective must remain squarely focused on returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions.  The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide concentrations were relatively stable for the past 10,000 years but then began to increase rapidly about 150 years ago…as a result of fossil fuel consumption and land use change.  Of course, changes in atmospheric composition are but one component of global change, which also includes disturbances in the physical and chemical conditions of the oceans and land surface.

These changes may adversely affect human health and the [[biosphere]] on which we depend.  Outbreaks of a number of diseases, including [[Lyme disease]], [[hantavirus infections]], [[dengue fever]], [[bubonic plague]], and [[cholera]], have been linked to climate change."&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activities resulting from the industrial revolution have changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere....Deforestation is now the second largest contributor to global warming, after the burning of fossil fuels. These human activities have significantly increased the concentration of "greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere.

As a consequence of global warming, they warn that a "rise in sea levels due to melting of ice caps is expected to occur. Rises in temperature will have complex and frequently localised effects on weather, but an overall increase in extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation patterns are probable, resulting in flooding and drought. The spread of [[tropical diseases]] is also expected."   Subsequently, the Institute of Biology advocates policies to reduce "greenhouse gas emissions, as we feel that the consequences of climate change are likely to be severe."&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million to 370 parts per million, an increase of around 30%.  On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5°C. This compared with 0.6°C over the previous century – about a 500% increase... This could lead to changing, and for all emissions scenarios more unpredictable, weather patterns around the world, less frost days, more extreme events (droughts and storm or flood disasters), and warmer sea temperatures and melting glaciers causing sea levels to rise.  ... Professional engineers commonly deal with risk, and frequently have to make judgments based on incomplete data. The available evidence suggests very strongly that human activities have already begun to make significant changes to the earth's climate, and that the long-term risk of delaying action is greater than the cost of avoiding/minimising the risk."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shape tables''' were a powerful yet little-used feature of the early [[Apple II]] ROMs, allowing for simple graphic manipulation on [[Apple II series]] computers, using the [[Apple II graphics|"hi-res" (HGR/HGR2) graphics mode]].  Shape tables were available from the BASIC interpreter in [[Applesoft BASIC]] and from machine code in the "Programmer's Aid" package that was bundled with the original [[Integer BASIC]] ROMs for that computer.

The [[Tuple|vector]]s of a two-dimensional graphic, each encoding a direction from the previous pixel along with a flag indicating whether the new pixel should be illuminated or not, were encoded up to three in a byte. These were stored in a table via the Monitor or the &lt;code&gt;[[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]&lt;/code&gt; command. From there, the graphic could be referenced by number (a table could contain up to 255 shapes), and built-in Applesoft routines permitted scaling, rotating, and drawing or erasing the shape. An [[XOR]] mode was also available to allow the shape to be visible on any color background; this had the advantage, also, of allowing the shape to be easily erased by redrawing it.

Apple did not provide any utilities for creating shape tables; they had to be created by hand, usually by plotting on graph paper, then calculating the hexadecimal values and entering them into the computer.  [[Beagle Bros]] created a shape table editing program, which eliminated the "number crunching", called ''[[Apple Mechanic]]'', and a related program, ''[[Font Mechanic]]''.

Applesoft's high-resolution graphics routines were not optimized for speed,&lt;ref name="simoni198308"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-08/1983_08_BYTE_08-08_The_C_Language#page/n291/mode/2up | title=A New Shape Subroutine for the Apple | work=BYTE | date=August 1983 | accessdate=9 February 2015 | author=Simoni, Richard T. Jr. | pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; so shape tables were not typically used for performance-critical software such as games, which were typically written in assembly language and used pre-shifted bitmap shapes. Shape tables were used primarily for static shapes and sometimes for fancy text; Beagle Bros offered a number of fonts in ''Font Mechanic'' as Applesoft shape tables.

The '''Simplified Instructional Computer''' (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical [[computer]] system introduced in ''System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming'', by Leland Beck. Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.

== SIC Architecture ==
The SIC machine has basic addressing, storing most memory addresses hexadecimal integer format. Similar to most modern computing systems, the SIC architecture stores all data in binary and uses the [[two's complement]] to represent negative values at the machine level. Memory storage in SIC consists of 8-bit bytes, and all memory addresses in SIC are byte addresses. Any three consecutive bytes form a 24-bit 'word' value, addressed by the location of the lowest numbered byte in the word value. Numeric values are stored as word values, and character values use the 8-bit [[ASCII]] system. The SIC machine does not support floating-point hardware and have at most 32,768 bytes of memory. There is also a more complicated machine built on top of SIC called the Simplified Instruction Computer with Extra Equipment (SIC/XE). The XE expansion of SIC adds a 48-bit floating point data type, an additional memory addressing mode, and extra memory (1 megabyte instead of 32,768 bytes) to the original machine. All SIC assembly code is upwards compatible with SIC/XE.

SIC machines have several registers, each 24 bits long and having both a numeric and character representation:
:* '''A (0)''': Used for basic arithmetic operations; known as the accumulator register.
:* '''X (1)''': Stores and calculates addresses; known as the index register.
:* '''L (2)''': Used for jumping to specific memory addresses and storing return addresses; known as the linkage register.
:* '''PC (8)''': Contains the address of the next instruction to execute; known as the program counter register.
:* '''SW (9)''': Contains a variety of information, such as carry or overflow flags; known as the status word register.

In addition to the standard SIC registers, there are also four additional general-purpose registers specific to the SIC/XE machine:
:* '''B (3)''': Used for addressing; known as the base register.
:* '''S (4)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''T (5)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''F (6)''': Floating point accumulator register (This register is 48-bits instead of 24).

These five/nine registers allow the SIC or SIC/XE machine to perform most simple tasks in a customized assembly language. In the System Software book, this is used with a theoretical series of operation codes to aid in the understanding of assemblers and linker-loaders required for the execution of [[assembly language]] code.

==Addressing Modes for SIC and SIC/XE==
The Simplified Instruction Computer has three instruction formats, and the Extra Equipment add-on includes a fourth. The instruction formats provide a model for memory and data management. Each format has a different representation in memory:
:*'''Format 1''': Consists of 8 bits of allocated memory to store instructions.
:*'''Format 2''': Consists of 16 bits of allocated memory to store 8 bits of instructions and two 4-bits segments to store operands.
:*'''Format 3''': Consists of 6 bits to store an instruction, 6 bits of flag values, and 12 bits of displacement.
:*'''Format 4''': Only valid on SIC/XE machines, consists of the same elements as format 3, but instead of a 12-bit displacement, stores a 20-bit address.

Both format 3 and format 4 have six-bit flag values in them, consisting of the following flag bits:
:*'''n''': Indirect addressing flag
:*'''i''': Immediate addressing flag
:*'''x''': Indexed addressing flag
:*'''b''': Base address-relative flag
:*'''p''': Program counter-relative flag
:*'''e''': Format 4 instruction flag

==Addressing Modes for SIC/XE==
* Rule 1:
*: e = 0 : format 3
*: e = 1 : format 4
** format 3:
**: b = 1, p = 0    (base relative)
**: b = 0, p = 1    (pc relative)
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
** format 4:
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
**: x = 1    (index)
**: i = 1, n = 0    (immediate)
**: i = 0, n = 1    (indirect)
**: i = 0, n = 0    (SIC)
**: i = 1, n = 1    (SIC/XE for SIC compatible)
* Rule 2:
*: i = 0, n =0	(SIC)
*: b, p, e is part of the address.

== SIC Assembly Syntax ==
SIC uses a special assembly language with its own operation codes that hold the hex values needed to assemble and execute programs. A sample program is provided below to get an idea of what a SIC program might look like. In the code below, there are three columns. The first column represents a forwarded symbol that will store its location in memory. The second column denotes either a SIC instruction (opcode) or a constant value (BYTE or WORD). The third column takes the symbol value obtained by going through the first column and uses it to run the operation specified in the second column. This process creates an object code, and all the object codes are put into an object file to be run by the SIC machine.

If you were to assemble this program, you would get the object code depicted below. The beginning of each line consists of a record type and hex values for memory locations. For example, the top line is an 'H' record, the first 6 hex digits signify its relative starting location, and the last 6 hex digits represent the program's size. The lines throughout are similar, with each 'T' record consisting of 6 hex digits to signify that line's starting location, 2 hex digits to indicate the size (in bytes) of the line, and the object codes that were created during the assembly process.

== Emulating the SIC System ==
Since the SIC and SIC/XE machines are not real machines, the task of actually constructing a SIC emulator is often part of coursework in a systems programming class. The purpose of SIC is to teach introductory-level systems programmers or collegiate students how to write and assemble code below higher-level languages like C and C++. With that being said, there are some sources of SIC-emulating programs across the web, however infrequent they may be.

In [[astronomy]], a '''thalassogen''' denotes a substance capable of forming a planetary [[ocean]].&lt;ref name="Freitas"&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization, First Edition, Xenology Research Institute, Sacramento, CA, 1979; http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thalassogens are not necessarily life sustaining, although most interest has been in the context of [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council. The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems. National Academies Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his essay "The Thalassogens", later published in his 1972 collection ''[[The Left Hand of the Electron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov, The Thalassogens, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, December 1970, ed.

Elements making up thalassogens have to be relatively abundant, the substance must be chemically stable in its environment, and must remain liquid under the conditions found on some planets. Freitas gives the following table,&lt;ref name="Freitas"/&gt; noting that the liquid range typically increases with increasing pressure:

The critical temperature and pressure represents the point where the distinction between gas and liquid vanishes, a possible upper limit for life (although life in [[supercritical fluids]] has been discussed both in science &lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; and fiction, such as in [[Close to Critical]] by [[Hal Clement]]).

Later authors have also suggested [[sulfuric acid]], [[ethane]], and water/ammonia mixtures as possible thalassogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bains |first=William |title=Many chemistries could be used to build living systems |journal=Astrobiology |date=June 2004 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=137–67 |doi=10.1089/153110704323175124 |pmid=15253836|bibcode=2004AsBio...4..137B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of possible subsurface oceans on moons such as [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] also extends the range of possible environments.

'''''The Status Civilization''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert Sheckley]], first published in 1960.

''The Status Civilization'' concerns Will Barrent, a man who finds himself, without memory of any crime or, indeed, of his previous life, being shipped across space to the planet Omega.

Omega, used to imprison extreme offenders, has a hierarchical society of extreme brutality, where the only way to advance (and avoid dying) is to commit an endless series of crimes. The average life expectancy from time of arrival on Omega is three years. The story concerns Barrent's attempt to survive, escape, and return to Earth to clear himself of the accusations against him.

==Plot summary==

[[Earth]] is a uniform, weakly structured, [[utopian]] society based on the mutual trust and conformity of its citizens. It is sleepy and stagnant, developing neither socially nor technologically. Its striking social stability is maintained by robots brainwashing children in "closed classes." The ideologies of both Earth and Omega resemble one another, differing only in words. On Omega, the citizens worship Evil (always capitalized) in a cult dedicated to an entity called The Black One. On Earth, the world religion is an amalgam of all the "good" aspects of previous Earth religions. Its institution is the Church of the Spirit of Mankind Incarnate.

As Barrent comes closer to the truth about the reasons for his incarceration, his Omegan consciousness conflicts with his subconsciousness which was programmed in the closed classes by the robots when he was a child. The subsequent psychological struggle is played out by repeating all of the previous fights and battles which Barrent experienced throughout the book, eventually making clear the vision (or "skrenning") which the mutant girl on Omega foresaw of Barrent's death.

==Biography and awards==
Born in May 1966, he is best known for his numerous [[Antarctic]] expeditions, particularly the period recreations of historical treks by Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] and Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], as well as the  record-breaking Antarctic crossing in 1999, undertaken with fellow Australian explorer [[Peter Treseder]]. As a result, he is the joint record holder for the fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic [[South Pole]] from the true edge of Antarctica (where the ice of the continent meets the sea).

He holds dual Australian/UK citizenships and spends his time primarily in Australia, with visits to the UK, the Americas, and Africa, for business and exploration-based activities and public engagements.

He is the author of ''The Unforgiving Minute'' which recounts his expeditions to the North and South Pole as well as the crossing of several Australian deserts. He is also involved in various philanthropic ventures including as a Board Member of Zoos SA (comprising [[Adelaide Zoo]] and [[Monarto Zoo]]), fundraising work with Helping Rhinos (a UK charity aiming to save rhinoceros species from extinction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpingrhinos.org/events/99/tim-jarvis-adventure-series|title=Helping Rhinos|last=|first=|date=27 September 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and his former role as councillor of the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]. He is also co-writer of a course for the Open University in environmental management. The course was linked with the [[BBC]]'s Frozen Planet series that aired in 2011.

Jarvis was accepted into the [[Yale World Fellows Program]] for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/worldfellows Yale World Fellows Program]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 9 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The program aims to broaden and strengthen the leadership skills of emerging leaders from across the world as they work on progressing thinking on global issues and challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timjarvis.org/index.php?m=21 Upcoming Events/Latest News]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

For his work on the 25zero project, Jarvis was awarded Conservationist of the Year in 2016 by the Australian Geographic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/awards/2016/10/tim-jarvis-conservationist-of-the-year-2016|title=Tim Jarvis is awarded Conservationist of the Year for his 25zero project|last=|first=|date=13 October 2016|website=|publisher=Australian Geographic Society|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is subsequently the only person to ever have been awarded both Adventurer and Conservationist medallions by the Society. Jarvis was also recognised with the Society's 'Spirit of Adventure' medal for his kayak journey across [[Lake Eyre]], Australia's largest salt lake, in 2004.

He received the [[Sydney Institute of Marine Science]]’s Emerald award (their highest) in 2013 for services to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sims.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Invitation-emerald-dinner-2013.pdf|title=SIMS Emerald Dinner 2013|last=|first=|date=1 January 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreation of Douglas Mawson's expedition ==

In April 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timjarvis.org/expeditions/sir-douglas-mawson-antarctic-journey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111221132/http://www.timjarvis.org/expeditions/sir-douglas-mawson-antarctic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Jarvis completed an expedition in Antarctica where he attempted to recreate the amazing expedition and human feat of Sir [[Douglas Mawson]]. Jarvis walked close to 500&amp;nbsp;km pulling a sleigh full of supplies, and living on almost the same rations as Mawson himself. Jarvis wanted to find out if the story of Mawson was physically possible. At the end of the expedition Jarvis said, "I haven't really done what Mawson did because I have doctors checking my situation, a film crew following me and a number of other safety precautions. Mawson had none of that."

The 2008 film of the expedition is available on DVD, ''Mawson – Life and Death In Antarctica''. The summary reads, "Combining the drama of Jarvis' contemporary adventure with chilling dramatic reconstructions, expert commentary and footage from the original expedition photographed by Frank Hurley, this is an extraordinary story of human survival."  Tim is also author of a book of the same name (Melbourne University Press, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-522-85486-2}}).

== Shackleton Epic ==

In February 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/test/wp-content/uploads/SE-NEWS-RELEASE-TEAM-ARRIVES-IN-STROMNESS-11-Feb-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis and five others successfully recreated Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s epic crossing of the Southern Ocean in the ''Alexandra Shackleton'', a replica of the ''James Caird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Team sets out to recreate Shackleton's epic journey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/team-sets-out-to-replicate-shackletons-epic-journey-8436009.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 January 2013|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same materials, clothing, food and a [[Thomas Mercer Chronometers|Thomas Mercer chronometer]] as in the original voyage,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/salon-qp/10425336/thomas-mercer-legacy-marine-chronometer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis and the team sailed their replica ''James Caird'' from Elephant Island, in the Southern Ocean, to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]], just as Shackleton did in 1916.&lt;ref name="timjarvis1"&gt;[http://www.timjarvis.org/shackletonepic/ Tim Jarvis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519192452/http://www.timjarvis.org/shackletonepic/ |date=19 May 2014 }}. Retrieved on 9 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The sea voyage was followed by a trek across the mountainous interior of South Georgia to the historic whaling station of Stromness. The construction of the replica ''James Caird'' was started in June 2008 and was finished in 2010, and was officially launched on 18 March 2012 in [[Dorset]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timjarvis.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ShackletonEpicMediaNotificationFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021011605/http://www.timjarvis.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ShackletonEpicMediaNotificationFinal.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hon. Alexandra Shackleton is patron of the expedition.&lt;ref name="timjarvis1"/&gt; The project, led by Jarvis, was the first to successfully recreate the 'double' voyage using only period gear.

Members of the Shackleton's Epic crew were Nick Bubb, Barry 'Baz' Gray, Paul Larson, Seb Coulthard, and [[Ed Wardle]]. The expedition's patron was the Hon. [[Alexandra Shackleton]], granddaughter of Sir Ernest Shackleton.

Jarvis was awarded the [[Royal Institute of Navigation]]’s Certificate of Achievement, in recognition of his leadership of the Shackleton Epic Expedition Team.

A documentary of the epic crossing has been made and ''[[Shackleton: Death or Glory]]'' went to air in the UK in September 2013 on Discovery UK and Australia in November 2013 on Special Broadcasting Service Australia; titled ''Chasing Shackleton'' for the USA market, it went to air in that region in January 2014 on the Public Broadcasting Service.&lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/film/&lt;/ref&gt;

A book authored by Tim titled ''Shackleton's Epic, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival'', published by Harper Collins, went on sale in the UK and Australia in November 2013; titled ''Chasing Shackleton, Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival'' for the USA market, it went on sale in January 2014 in the USA. {{ISBN|978-0-00-754952-8}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://shackletonepic.com/book/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project 25zero ==

Tim Jarvis founded the [[25zero]] Project to highlight the retreat of glaciers on the world’s 25 glaciated equatorial mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Jarvis is awarded Conservationist of the Year for his 25zero project|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/awards/2016/10/tim-jarvis-conservationist-of-the-year-2016|website=Australian Geographic Society|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assembled a team of mountaineers to join him in advance of COP21&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Andrew|title=Australian Museum's Tim Jarvis leads mountain climbs to campaign on climate change|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/australian-museums-tim-jarvis-leads-mountain-climbs-to-campaign-on-climate-change-20150914-gjlync.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to document the impact of climate change and to communicate how each of the 25 equatorial mountains will lose its glacier 'within an average 25 years.' At the time of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], 25 mountains had glaciers, although since that time, four have gone extinct, leaving only 21 mountains with glaciers at the equator. A new documentary series about the project, due for release in 2018, will highlight the beauty of the remaining glaciers while showing the result of inaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25zero|url=https://www.25zero.com/|website=25zero|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''We Have Never Been Modern''''' is a 1991 book by [[Bruno Latour]], originally published in French as ''Nous n'avons jamais été modernes : Essai d'anthropologie symétrique'' (English translation: 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Content==
The book is an "anthropology of science" that explores the dualistic distinction [[modernity]] makes between [[nature]] and [[society]]. [[Pre-modern]] peoples, argues Latour, made no such division. Contemporary matters  of public concern such as [[global warming]], the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and emerging [[biotechnologies]] mix politics, science, popular and specialist discourse to such a degree that a tidy nature/culture dualism is no longer possible. This inconsistency has given rise to [[post-modern]] and [[Anarcho-primitivism|anti-modern]] movements&lt;!--NOTE: the link to "Anarcho-primitivism" is only a rough and far from ideal fit to Latour's conception of "anti-modernism". Insert a better one if you can--&gt;. Latour attempts to reconnect the social and natural worlds by arguing that the modernist distinction between nature and culture never existed. He claims we must rework our thinking to conceive of a "Parliament of Things" wherein [[natural phenomena]], [[social phenomena]] and the [[discourse]] about them are not seen as separate objects to be studied by [[experts|specialist]]s, but as [[wikt:hybrid|hybrids]] made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="683">'''Weapon Effects Simulation''' (WES) is the creation of artificial weapons effects such as flashes, bangs and smoke during military training exercises.  It is used in combination with [[Tactical engagement simulation]] (TES), which uses laser projection for training purposes instead of bullets and missiles.  Typically, an accurate laser "shot" hitting a target such as a tank, will trigger cartridge-based WES equipment fitted to the tank which will give a flash, bang and smoke, signifying a hit in the exercise scenario.
