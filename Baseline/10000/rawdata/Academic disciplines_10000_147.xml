{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}
In [[biology]] and [[ecology]], '''abiotic components''' or '''abiotic factors''' are non-living chemical and [[Physical property|physical]] parts of the [[Natural environment|environment]] that affect living [[organism]]s and the functioning of [[ecosystem]]s. Abiotic factors and the phenomena associated with them underpin all biology. 

Abiotic components include physical conditions and non-living [[Resource (biology)|resources]] that affect living organisms in terms of [[Developmental biology|growth]], [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]], and [[reproduction]].  Resources are distinguished as substances or objects in the environment required by one organism and consumed or otherwise made unavailable for use by other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, R.E. 2005. ''The Economy of Nature, 6th edition''. WH Freeman, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, H.A. Mooney, M.C. Chapin, and P. Matson. 2011. Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abiotic Factors.tif|thumb|These are different settings on earth that are abiotic factors, which mean they are not living organisms, that contribute to the earth in many different ways.]]
Component degradation of a substance occurs by [[chemical process|chemical]] or [[Physical change|physical process]]es, e.g. [[hydrolysis]].  All non-living components of an ecosystem, such as atmospheric conditions and water resources, are called abiotic components.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Vocabulary. ISO 6107-6:1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In biology, abiotic factors can include water, light, radiation, temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmosphere]], and soil. The macroscopic climate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be considered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=EoEarth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |year=2010 |last=Hogan |first=C.

Consider the differences in the mechanics of [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]], and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants in regulating the influx of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[Calvin-Benson Cycle]] in relation to their abiotic stressors. C3 plants have no mechanisms to manage [[photorespiration]], whereas C4 and CAM plants utilize a separate [[PEP Carboxylase]] enzyme to prevent photorespiration, thus increasing the yield of photosynthetic processes in certain high energy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chuali|last2=Guo|first2=Longyun|last3=Li|first3=Yixue|last4=Wang|first4=Zhuo|title=Systematic Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants Based on Metabolic Network Analysis|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=2012|volume=6|issue=59|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubisco and C4 Plants|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/066/Rubisco%20and%20C4%20plants.pdf?v=1353967268963|website=RSC: Advancing the Chemical Sciences|publisher=RSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Archea]] require very high temperatures, pressures or unusual concentrations of chemical substances such as sulfur; this is due to their specialization into extreme conditions. In addition, fungi have also evolved to survive at the temperature, the humidity, and stability of their environment.&lt;ref name=UWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |title=Abiotic Components |publisher=Department of Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, [[University of the Western Cape]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425160041/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/SCI_ED/grade10/ecology/abiotic/abiot.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, there is a significant difference in access in both water and humidity between [[temperate rain forest]]s and [[desert]]s. This difference in water availability causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that survive in these areas. These differences in abiotic components alter the species present both by creating boundaries of what species can survive within the environment, as well as influencing competition between two species. Abiotic factors such as salinity can give one species a competitive advantage over another, creating pressures that lead to speciation and alteration of a species to and from generalist and specialist competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunson|first=William A.|date=November 1991|title=The Role of Abiotic Factors in Community Organization|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/stable/pdf/2462508.pdf|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=138 |issue=5|pages=1067–1091|doi=10.1086/285270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anacoluthon''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ə|k|ə|ˈ|lj|uː|θ|ɒ|n}} {{respell|AN|ə|kə|LEW|thon}}; from the Greek ''anakolouthon'', from ''an-'': "not" and ἀκόλουθος ''akólouthos'': "following") is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |title=Anacoluthon - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425165000/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anacoluthon |archivedate=April 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the Italian proverb "The good stuff – think about it."&lt;ref&gt;''Alla buona derrata, pensaci su'', from {{cite book | last1 = Mawr | first = E.B. | year = 1885 | title = Analogous Proverbs in Ten Languages | page = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally it is considered to be an error in sentence structure, and results in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in "[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]" literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought. Anacoluthon is very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, a dash (—) is often included at the point of discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gowers | first = E. | year = 1973 | title = The Complete Plain Words | page = 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.

==Examples==
*"Had ye been there – for what could that have done?" ([[John Milton]] in ''Lycidas'')

In [[Paradise Lost]], [[John Milton]] uses an anacoluthon with Satan's first words to illustrate his initial confusion:
*"If thou beest he; but O how fallen! How changed" (I.83)

[[William Shakespeare]] uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' IV iii 34-6):
*"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
*:That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
*:Let him depart."

Additionally, [[Conrad Aiken]]'s ''Rimbaud and Verlaine'' has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
*"Discussing, between moves, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] and [[spondee]]
*:Anacoluthon and the open vowel
*:God the great peacock with his [[angel]] peacocks
*:And his dependent peacocks the bright stars..."

[[Franz Kafka]] uses perhaps the most famed example of anacoluthon as the first line of [[The Metamorphosis]]:
"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin."

==Etymology==
The word ''anacoluthon'' is a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακόλουθον}} (''anakólouthon''), which derives from the [[privative]] prefix {{lang|el|ἀν-}} (''an-'') and the root adjective {{lang|el|ἀκόλουθος}} (''akólouthos''), "following". This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]'' in [[logic]].  However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used ''both'' for the logical error of ''non sequitur'' and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==

The term "anacoluthon" is used primarily within an academic context.  It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry.  For example ''[[The King's English]]'', an English [[style guide]] written by [[H. W. Fowler]] and [[F. G. Fowler]], mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term does occasionally appear in popular media as well.  The word, though not the underlying meaning (see [[malapropism]]), has been popularized, due to its use as an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] by [[Captain Haddock]] in the English translations of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series of books.

In [[mathematics]] (in particular [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]]) and all [[natural science]]s (e.g. [[astronomy]] and [[geophysics]]), the '''angular distance''' ('''angular separation''', '''apparent distance''', or '''apparent separation''') between two point objects, as viewed from a location different from either of these objects, is the [[angle]] of [[length]] between the two directions originating from the observer and pointing toward these two objects.

==Use==
The term ''angular distance'' (or ''separation'') is technically synonymous with ''angle'' itself, but is meant to suggest the (often vast, unknown, or irrelevant) linear [[distance]] between these objects (for instance, [[star]]s as observed from [[Earth]]).

==Measurement==
Since the angular distance (or separation) is conceptually identical to an angle, it is measured in the same [[Units of measurement|units]], such as [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or [[radian]]s, using instruments such as [[goniometer]]s or optical instruments specially designed to point in well-defined directions and record the corresponding angles (such as [[telescope]]s).

==Equation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}} 
In order to calculate the angular distance &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] for [[binary star system]]s, [[extrasolar planet]]s, [[solar system|solar system objects]] and other [[astronomical object]]s, we use [[orbital distance]] ([[semi-major axis]]), &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, in [[Astronomical unit|AU]] divided by [[stellar distance]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; in [[parsec]]s, per the small-angle approximation for &lt;math&gt;\tan(\frac aD)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta \approx \dfrac aD&lt;/math&gt;

Given two angular positions, each specified by a [[Right ascension|right ascension (RA)]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in [0, 2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;; and [[Declination|declination (dec)]], &lt;math&gt;\delta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]&lt;/math&gt;, the angular distance between the two points can be calculated as,
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \cos^{-1} \left[ \sin(\delta_1) \sin(\delta_2) + \cos(\delta_1) \cos(\delta_2) \cos(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research''' (AMD), with headquarters at [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]] and seven regional centrers, is the oldest unit of the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)]] (DAE), [[Government of India]]. The principal mandate of the organisation is to carry out geological exploration and discover mineral deposits required for [[nuclear power]] programme of [[India]].

==History==

AMD started functioning from [[New Delhi]] on 10 August 1948 as ‘Rare Minerals Survey Unit'. Renamed first as ‘Raw Materials Division’ and then as ‘Atomic Minerals Division’ in 1958, it was shifted to Hyderabad in 1974. On 29 July 1998 it underwent the latest name change as 'Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research' to assert its status as a premier geological exploration and research organisation. Professor [[Darashaw Nosherwan Wadia|D.N. Wadia]], FRS, a doyen among Indian geologists guided the organisation from its inception to 1970 as Geological Adviser to [[Government of India]].

==Work spectrum==
 The prime mandate of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research is to identify and evaluate uranium resources required for the successful implementation of Atomic Energy programme of the country.
AMD over the past five decades has been instrumental in locating [[Uranium]] resources in Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkhand; KPM (Domiasiat), Wahkut, Wahkyn, [[Meghalaya]]; Lambapur - Chitrial, Peddagattu, [[Telangana]]; Tummalapalle, [[Andhra Pradesh]]; Gogi, [[Karnataka]] and Rohil, [[Rajasthan]]. AMD also has established vast resources of thorium in the coastal tracts of [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Orissa, India|Odisha]]. AMD has also extented its contribution towards recovery of Rare Metals and Rare Earths elements.

==Organisation==

Apart from the headquarters, centralised laboratories and specialised groups at Hyderabad,  AMD has seven regional centres at [[New Delhi]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shillong]], [[Jamshedpur]], [[Nagpur]], [[Bangalore]] and Hyderabad. Two sectional offices are located at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and [[Vishakhapatnam]] for beach sand and offshore investigations. AMD commenced its operations with a nucleus of 17 geoscientists which has grown to 2777 personnel today.

*Develop students' skill in object-oriented software design methods and data management systems.
Provide professional training to students by combining information technology with managerial skills.
*Prepare students to proceed on to post graduate level study in information management within and outside the country.

==Careers==
Graduating with a bachelors in Information Management highly beneficial as it opens up a plethora of career options and routes for students. This is manly due to the fact that employers now-a-days show a growing interest for applicants with both a business management education as well as an IT background. Paul Matthews from the Institute of IT Professionals stated that "Employers tell me the key thing holding them back is the ability to get skilled people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gifford|first1=Adam|title=Surge in demand for IT graduates|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10902070|website=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree would be beneficial as it is employable all over world. Every company has an IT department, which even in non-tech firms, play an essential role in the company's daily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing a digital wave, or drowning?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591201-information-technology-everywhere-companies-it-departments-mixed|website=The Economist|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine combination of IT and management that this degree offers, has shown career prospects in fields such as:
* Software Designers and Engineers
* Advertising and Marketing Executives
* IT Consultants and Planners
* Sales and retail assistants
* Chartered Accountants
* Computer programmers and programmer developers
* As well as many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top destinations for "Information Management" graduates |url=http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information+Management |website=University of London |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029133917/http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information%2BManagement |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from these types of degrees have also found themselves working for some of the world's top organisations including Ernst and Young, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, and Bruder Mannesmann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Management for Business BSc|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/ubsinfsbus05|website=UCL|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Graduate Programs==
Keep in mind that although you can start a career straight after your bachelors, you may also be interested in furthering your study by enrolling in a masters program. Employers seem to be finding that business management undergraduates are too keen on starting work immediately, without actually having attained the essential skills need for a professional workplace. This may be in terms of general maturity and also the students ability to 'hit the ground running'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a business graduate more employable?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-business-graduate-more-employable-31800|website=The Conversation|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where masters students have the greater advantage.

There are many different masters programs available to graduates from an Information Management degree. However at this point, the studies tend to narrow down to more specific areas. As you have a solid background in both Business Management and IT, you have a large range to choose from.

If after studying you seem to be more keen in IT then perhaps you should consider doing a masters in either computer science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 2 Best Master's Degree For Jobs: Computer Science|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ifij/no-2-best-masters-degree-for-jobs-computer-science/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or information systems.These two programs are some of the best for finding postgraduate jobs with high earning salaries.

==Student life==
Information Management students enrolled in a full-time degree generally have 8–13 hours a week in class, whether its lectures, tutorials, or seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However time must be spend outside of class working on coursework and assignments as well as doing prerequisite readings for certain modules.

One of the hardest parts about being a student is learning how to survive on a budget. To compensate for this, many students choose to get a part-time job while studying. In the United States, about 50% of students have a part-time job whilst enrolled in a full-time degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orszag|first1=Jonathan|title=LEARNING AND EARNING: WORKING IN COLLEGE|url=http://www.brockport.edu/career01/upromise|website=Brockport|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it becomes increasing difficult to balance a part-time job along with course work, classes, good grades, self study time, and social life. Often self study time suffers the most from part-time jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Richardson|first1=Mark|title=Academic plate spinning: The difficulties of balancing full time degree study with a part-time job |publisher=University of Worcester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it would be recommended to work no more than 10 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22588">'''Biorock''', also known as '''Seacrete''' or '''Seament''', is a trademark name used by Biorock, Inc. to refer to the substance formed by electro-accumulation of [[mineral]]s dissolved in [[seawater]]. [[Wolf Hilbertz]] developed the process and patented it in 1979.&lt;ref name="us4246075"&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=4246075 |status=patent|gdate=1981-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building process, popularly called [[wikt:accretion|accretion]], is not to be confused with Biorock [[sewage treatment]]. The biorock building process grows [[cement]]-like engineering [[structure]]s and [[marine ecosystems]], often for [[mariculture]] of [[coral]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, [[lobster]]s and [[fish]] in salt water. It works by passing a small [[electric current]] through [[electrode]]s in the water. The structure grows more or less without limit as long as current flows.

== History ==
[[Image:Aragonite in tube.JPG|thumb|left|Aragonite in tube]]
[[Artificial reefs]] have been built since the 1950s using materials including sunken ships, concrete blocks and discarded tires. However, most of these plans failed to provide coral habitat.  Most notoriously, [[Osborne Reef|tires were strapped down off the shore of Fort Lauderdale]] and became an environmental disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-02-17-florida-reef_x.htm|title=Tire reef off Florida proves a disaster |website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2018-08-12 |last=Skoloff |first=Brian |date=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artificial reefs succeeded, but most remain relatively barren compared with natural reefs.

Biorock technology arose from experiments in the 1970s when Hilbertz was studying how seashells and reefs grow, by passing electric currents through salt water. In 1974, he found that as the salt water [[electrolyze]]s, [[calcium carbonate]] ([[aragonite]]) combines with [[magnesium]], [[chloride]] and [[Hydroxyl radical|hydroxyl]] ions to slowly accrete around the [[cathode]], eventually coating the [[electrode]] with a material similar in composition to [[Sorel cement|magnesium oxychloride]] cements and as strong as concrete. Over time cathodic protection replaces the negative chloride ion (Cl-) with dissolved [[bicarbonate]] (HCO3-) to harden the coating to a [[hydromagnesite]]-[[aragonite]] mixture with gaseous oxygen evolving through the porous structure. Later experiments showed that the coatings can thicken at the rate of 5&amp;nbsp;cm per year. As long as current flows, the structure continues to grow and strengthen. It can heal itself if damaged, making it particularly useful as a replacement for concrete in hard-to-access locations.  High levels of dissolved oxygen make it particularly attractive to marine organisms, particularly fin fish.

Hilbertz originally called his invention, on which he obtained several patents, underwater mineral accretion or accretion for short. Hilbertz’s original plan was to use this technology to grow low-cost structures in the ocean for developing countries. He also envisioned accreting large [[aquadynamic]] OTEC [[ocean thermal energy conversion]] plants, both for generating power and for producing [[hydrogen]], [[ammonia]], and [[magnesium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name="Hilbertz, W. H. pp. 94-113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hilbertz|first1=W. H.|last2=et al.|date=July 1979|title=Electrodeposition of minerals in sea water: Experiments and applications|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1145428/|journal=Journal of Oceanic Engineering|language=en-US|volume=4|issue=3|pages=|access-date=2018-08-13|via=|website=|pp=94-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeared to result in a building process largely independent of land-based resources.

His focus shifted to coral reefs after meeting [[Thomas J. Goreau]] in the 1980s. They formed a partnership. Goreau continued work on biorock technologies and coral reef restoration after Hilbertz' death in 2007. Because the biorock process uses such simple materials, electrode forms can be constructed in to mimic natural reefs. Since the combined hydrated magnesium [[Oxohalide|oxychloride]], [[brucite]] (magnesium hydroxide) - later [[hydromagnesite]] (magnesium chlorocarbonate) and aragonite (calcium carbonate) coating that forms is so similar to natural reef [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], corals readily take to biorock reefs. Coral thrive on the electrified and oxygenated reef environment. One prominent example was in the [[Maldives]] during the 1998 warming, during which fewer than 5% of the natural reef corals survived. On biorock reefs there, 80% of corals flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Goreau, T. J, ''A Solution for Corals in Peril, A GCRA Overview'', GCRA website, April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

With others, Hilbertz and Goreau made two expeditions to the [[Saya de Malha]] bank in 1997 and 2002. Using Biorock technology, they attempted to grow an [[artificial island]] around steel structures that were anchored to the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfhilbertz.com/downloads/2002/saya_2002_rev1.pdf|title=PDF of the Saya de Malha expedition 2002, rev. 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "Seacrete" the process was publicised in a 1992 book of [[futurology]], [[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps|''The Millennial Project'']]. Author [[Marshall Savage]] reiterated Hilbertz' earlier proposal that the conductive metal [[magnesium]] be extracted from ocean water, and that the process use electricity from ocean thermal energy conversion. In 2012, both Goreau and Robert K. Trench, writing together with Goreau, published works on how Biorock could generate building materials as well as restoring damaged ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goreau|first=Thomas J.|title=Marine Electrolysis for Building Materials and Environmental Restoration|date=2012-10-17|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/electrolysis/marine-electrolysis-for-building-materials-and-environmental-restoration |journal=Electrolysis|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/48783|isbn=9789535107934|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goreau|first=Thomas J.|last2=Trench|first2=Robert Kent|date=2012-12-04|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466557734|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n8PoPCUZTTAC}}|title=Innovative Methods of Marine Ecosystem Restoration|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

Applying a [[low voltage]] electric current (safe for swimmers and marine life) to a submerged, conductive structure causes dissolved minerals in seawater, principally calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate to precipitate and adhere to that structure. The result is a composite of [[brucite]] [[hydromagnesite]] and [[limestone]] with mechanical strength similar to concrete. Derived from seawater, this material is similar to the composition of natural coral reefs and sand beaches.

Biorock structures can be built in any size or shape depending only on the physical makeup of the sea bottom, wave, current energies and construction materials. They are well suited for remote, [[third world]] sites where exotic building materials, construction equipment and appropriately [[skilled labor]] are not available.

=== Constructing a reef ===
[[File:Manta ray Biorock reef.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A newly construct Biorock reef set up by [[Gili Eco Trust]] in [[Indonesia]].]]
To build a biorock reef, a welded, electrically conductive frame, often made from construction grade [[rebar]] or [[wire mesh]], is submerged and attached to the sea bottom. A low voltage direct current is applied. This initiates an electrolytic reaction that precipitates mineral crystals naturally found in seawater, mainly [[calcium carbonate]] and [[magnesium hydroxide]], on the structure.

Within days, the structure takes on a whitish hue as it becomes encrusted with precipitated minerals that add rigidity and strength. Electric fields, plus the shade and protection offered by the metal/limestone frame, attract colonizing marine life, including fish, crabs, clams, octopus, lobster and sea urchins.

Once the structure is in place and minerals begin to coat the surface, the next phase of reef construction begins. [[Scuba diving|Divers]] transplant coral fragments from other reefs, attaching them to the ark’s frame. Immediately, these coral pieces begin to bond to the accreted mineral substrate and because of evolved oxygen and the electrochemically facilitated accretion of dissolved ions, such as bicarbonate - start to grow—typically three to five times faster than normal. Soon the reef takes on the appearance and utility of a natural reef [[ecosystem]] rather than a man-made one.

[[Electrolysis]] of biorock reefs enhances coral growth, reproduction and ability to resist environmental stress.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Coral species typically found on healthy reefs gain a major advantage over the weedy organisms that often overgrow them on stressed reefs. In tests where the electric current is interrupted, mineral accretion stops and seaweed begins to cover the corals. If the current is maintained, coral reef habitats can often be restored even in areas where water quality would prevent their recovery by any other method.

Biorock reefs grow rapidly and strengthen as they age. They thus have great potential for many applications, such as making breakwaters. If waves or colliding ships cause damage, renewed accretion makes them, to an extent, self-repairing.

=== Technical specifications ===

Biorock accelerates growth on [[coral reef]]s by as much as fivefold and increases coral survival.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Biorock can enable coral growth and regrowth even in the presence of [[environmental stress]] such as [[thermal pollution]], i.e. increasing water temperatures. When mixed with [[construction aggregate]]s, it can build components on the [[sea floor]] or on land. Biorock represents the only known method that can sustain and grow natural coral species using only basic conducting elements, typically of a common metal such as [[steel]].

Biorock samples range in [[compressive strength]] from 3720 to 5350[[&amp;nbsp;lbf/in²]] (26 to 37[[MPa]]) &amp;ndash; for comparison, the [[concrete]] typically used in sidewalks has a strength of about 3500&amp;nbsp;lbf/in² (24 MPa). 

Main components of biorock include [[magnesium hydroxide]] and [[calcium carbonate]]. This composition is chiefly the result of the [[ion]]ic composition of [[seawater]].&lt;ref name="Hilbertz, W. H. pp. 94-113" /&gt; One [[kilowatt hour]] of electricity accretes about 0.4 to 1.5 [[kg]] (0.9 to 3.3&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]) of biorock, depending on parameters such as depth, electric current, [[salinity]] and water [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.globalcoral.org/_oldgcra/Alvaro%20Ortega%20biorock.pdf |last= Ortega|first=Alvaro|title=Basic Technology: Mineral Accretion for Shelter.

Biorock is cost-effective, requiring only metal bars or equivalent and electricity. While electricity provided from [[fossil fuel]]s generates [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], biorock projects often use renewable [[solar power]], [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], or [[wave power]]. The resulting material is cheaper than concrete blocks in many places, depending on electricity and cement transport costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goreau|first=Thomas|last2=Hilbertz|first2=W|date=2005-01-01|title=Marine ecosystem restoration: Costs and benefits for coral reefs|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313104551_Marine_ecosystem_restoration_Costs_and_benefits_for_coral_reefs|journal=World Res.

In one study, ''[[Porites]]'' development was compared between colonies with and without an electric field for 6 months. The electric field was eliminated after the sixth month. Longitudinal growth was relatively high in the presence of the field, but dropped thereafter. Growth differences were significant only during the first 4 months. Girth growth differences were significant in the early months. The treatment corals survived at a higher rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabater|first=Marlowe G.|last2=Yap|first2=Helen T.|date=November 2004|title=Long-term effects of induced mineral accretion on growth, survival and corallite properties of Porites cylindrica Dana|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022098104003181|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=311|issue=2|pages=355–374|doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2004.05.013|issn=0022-0981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

As of 2011, biorock coral reef projects had been installed in over 20 countries, in the [[Caribbean]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Pacific]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. One project is located on one of the most remote and unexplored reef areas of the world, the [[Saya de Malha Bank]] in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzeit, Frank + Hilbertz, W. H. + Goreau, T. J., ''Saya de Malha Expedition, March 2002'', Sun&amp;Sea e.V. Hamburg, August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Other biorock projects are located in [[French Polynesia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Maldives]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Seychelles]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]]. Indonesia has the most biorock projects, with sites near over half a dozen islands, including the world's two largest reef restoration projects: Pemuteran with the Karang Lestari and the [[Gili Islands|Gili islands]] with the [[Gili Eco Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Goreau, T. J, comments quoted in ''Independent Study Project on Biorock'', GCRA website, February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Non-coral biorock projects have been conducted in places such as [[Barataria Bay]], [[Galveston]], [[seagrass]]es in the [[Mediterranean]], oyster reefs and [[salt marsh]]es in [[New York City]], in [[Port Aransas, Texas|Port Aransas]], and in [[St. Croix]].

=== Maldives ===
On [[Kaafu Atoll|Vabbinfaru]] island in the Maldives, a 12-meter, 2 ton steel cage called the Lotus was secured on the sea floor. As of 2012, coral was so abundant on the structure that the cage is difficult to discern. The 1998 [[El Niño|El Nino]] killed 98% of the reef around Vabbinfaru. Abdul Azeez, who led the Vabbinfaru project, said coral growth on the structure is up to five times that of elsewhere. A smaller prototype device was in place during the 1998 warming event and more than 80% of its corals survived, compared to just 2% elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120905-save-our-dying-coral-reefs|title=How can we save our dying coral reefs?|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Vince|first=Gaia|date=6 September 2012|website=bbc.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, power is no longer supplied to the project, leaving it vulnerable to the next round of bleaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64173">'''Research networking''' ('''RN''') is about using tools to identify, locate and use research and scholarly information about people and resources. '''Research networking tools''' ('''RN tools''') serve as [[knowledge management]] systems for the research enterprise. RN tools connect institution-level/enterprise systems, national research networks, publicly available research data (e.g., grants and publications), and restricted/proprietary data by harvesting information from disparate sources into compiled profiles for faculty, investigators, scholars, clinicians, community partners and facilities. RN tools facilitate collaboration and team science to address research challenges through the rapid discovery and recommendation of researchers, expertise and resources.&lt;ref name="F1000VIVO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istl.org/11-spring/article1.html|title=Faculty of 1000 and VIVO:  Invisible Colleges and Team Science - Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship|website=www.istl.org|access-date=2018-07-14|last=Carey |first=J |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fazel-Zarandi M, Devlin HJ, Huang Y and Contractor N (2011). "Expert recommendation based on social drivers, social network analysis, and semantic data representation". ''2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems''. pp. 41-48. (ACM, Chicago, IL)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
RN tools differ from [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as in that they access information in databases and other data not limited to web pages. They also differ from [[Social networking service|social networking]] systems in that they represent a compendium of data ingested from authoritative and verifiable sources rather than predominantly individually-posted information, making RN tools more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gewin | first1 = V |date =15 December 2010 | title = Collaboration: Social networking seeks critical mass | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7326/full/nj7326-993a.html | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue =7326 | pages = 993–4 |doi=10.1038/nj7326-993a }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, RN tools have sufficient flexibility to allow for profile editing.  RN tools provide resources to bolster human connections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Contractor | first1 = NS | last2 = Monge | first2 = PR |date=November 2002 | title = Managing knowledge networks | url =http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/16/2/249.extract | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–58  |doi=10.1177/089331802237238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they can make non-intuitive matches, do not depend on serendipity and do not have a propensity to return only to previously identified collaborations/collaborators.  RN tools generally have associated analytical capabilities that enable evaluation of collaboration and cross-disciplinary research/scholarly activity, especially over time. 

RN tools and research profiling systems can help researchers gain recognition. Active promotion of scholarship is an aspect of the publication cycle. Commercial and non-profit services help researchers increase visibility and recognition. Digital researcher services enhance discoverability, shareability and citability of scholarship. According to Shanks and Arlitsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanks|first=Justin|last2=Arlitsch|first2=Kenning|date=2016-04-02|title=Making Sense of Researcher Services|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=56|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital researcher services fall into three categories: 

* Author/Researcher Identification—these services provide infrastructure that may be used in the other two categories, such as unique identifiers and name disambiguation.
* Academic and Professional Networking—most succinctly described as “social networking for academics,” these services focus on connecting users based on research interest, affiliation, geography or other variables.
* Reference and Citation Management—these tools and services include some of the functionality and features of other categories, although their primary focus is on management of citations that a researcher compiles for use within a publication or for sharing with other researchers.

Importantly, data harvested into RN tools can be repurposed, especially if available as [[Linked Open Data]] ([[RDF/XML|RDF]] triples). These RN tools enhance research support activities by providing data for customized, web pages, CV/biosketch generation and data tables for grant proposals.

== Users profiled, user interactivity and networking functionality ==

This table provides information on what user population is profiled for each tool, ability for users to edit their own profile data and type of networking.  Active networking means that the user can enter connections to the network by entering colleagues' names.  Passive networking means that the software infers network connections from a user's publication co-authors and builds a network from these names.

'''Drama theory''' is one of the [[problem structuring methods]] in [[operations research]]. It is based on [[game theory]] and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played.

Drama theory was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 90s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's [[metagame analysis]] work developed at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book "Paradoxes of Rationality", published by [[MIT Press]]. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT).

== Basics of drama theory ==

A drama unfolds through ''episodes'' in which ''characters'' interact. The episode is a period of ''preplay communication'' between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of ''scene-setting'', ''build-up'', ''climax'' and ''decision''. This is followed by ''denouement'', which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of [[The Prisoner's Dilemma (play)|Prisoner's Dilemma]], a West End play by [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] about the problems of peace-keeping.
 
In the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred ''position'' – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a ''fallback'' or ''stated intention''. This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a ''threatened future'' if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an ''agreement''.

When it is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a ''moment of truth''. Here they usually face ''dilemmas'' arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the [[prisoner's dilemma]] game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the [[game of chicken]]; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character.

Drama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the ''climax'', where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the [http://www.dodccrp.org/events/8th_ICCRTS/pdf/134.pdf 8th International Command &amp; Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003]—from whose site it can be downloaded.

Six dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a ''resolution'' meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a 'game with a focal point' – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves.

== Dilemmas defined in drama theory ==

The dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows.

# A's cooperation dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement B's position.
# A's trust dilemma: A doesn't believe B would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement A's position.
# A's persuasion (also known as Deterrence) dilemma: B certainly prefers the threatened future to A's position.
# A's rejection (also known as Inducement) dilemma: A may prefer B's position to the threatened future.
# A's threat dilemma: B doesn't believe A would carry out its threat not to implement B's position.
# A's positioning dilemma: A prefers B's position to its own, but rejects it (usually because A considers B's position to be unrealistic).

== Relationship to game theory ==

Drama-theorists build and analyze models (called ''card tables'' or ''options boards'') that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model-builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

The relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.

'''Edging''', '''peaking''', or '''surfing''',&lt;ref name=Bodansky&gt;''Extended Massive Orgasm'', Steve and Vera Bodansky, (2000), pp. 91, 92, 94–98, {{ISBN|0-89793-289-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a orgasm control sexual technique which may be practiced either alone or with a partner and involves the maintenance of a high level of [[sexual arousal]] for an extended period of time without reaching [[Orgasm|climax]].

When practiced by males, orgasm control allows the practitioner to enjoy direct sexual stimulation without waiting through the refractory period common after orgasm. When the decision is made to allow orgasm, the physical sensations may be much greater and more pleasurable than if the orgasm were experienced conventionally. Orgasm control is referenced as 'slow masturbation' in [[Alex Comfort]]'s ''The New Joy of Sex'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;''The New Joy of Sex'', [[Alex Comfort]], (1993), {{ISBN|1-85732-097-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'extended massive orgasm' in Vera and Steve Bodansky's 2000 book of the same name,&lt;ref name=Bodansky/&gt; and is similar to the [[Venus Butterfly]] technique used in the volume ''The One Hour Orgasm'' (1988) by Leah and Bob Schwartz.

Since orgasm control prolongs the experience of powerful sexual sensations occurring during the final build-up to orgasm, the physical demands of being kept or keeping oneself in this highly excited state for an extended time can induce a pleasurable, almost euphoric state.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Orgasm control can involve either [[sex partner]] being in control of the other partner's orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with a partner or by [[masturbation]]. To experience orgasm control, any method of [[sexual stimulation]] can be used.

== In partnered sex ==
When shared in sexual activity between partners, one partner would stimulate the other, gradually bringing them up to the point high in the plateau phase where an orgasm is actually building, and will then reduce the level of stimulation to just below that needed to trigger the orgasm. If control of the orgasm is given to a partner and orgasm is not allowed for a time in order to develop an increased level of sexual tension, it is referred to as [[erotic sexual denial]]. By carefully varying the intensity and speed of stimulation, and by practicing with the same partner to learn his or her responses, a person can be held in the highly aroused state near orgasm. This process may be repeated as desired, but at some point repetition may cause the urge to orgasm to become overwhelming. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to the increased tension and [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] that builds up during the extended stimulation. If the partner whose orgasm is being controlled, sometimes referred to as the [[submissive]] partner, is [[Bondage (sexual)|tied up]], it may better control the orgasm (the activity is sometimes called [[Erotic sexual denial#Tie and tease|tie and tease]] and if orgasm is denied it is [[tease and denial]]). Another possibility is for one partner to help produce [[multiple orgasm]]s in the other.

== In masturbation ==
{{original research|date=November 2010}}
When practiced alone, orgasm control is beneficial for heightening sexual pleasure as well as a training tool which permits the practitioner to increase the duration of sex with a partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} For the female, because there is little or no post-orgasm refractory period, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods of time, as well as with increased frequency and intensity. For the male, the speed of the rubbing or stroking of the penis may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a longer or more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. Because solo masturbation allows for precise control over the feelings, the timing, and the speed of stimulation, many people practice orgasmic control by themselves. One technique, commonly referred to as 'edging', involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Another technique, commonly referred to as 'surfing', involves reaching the plateau phase and slowing down the stimulation to maintain a heightened level of sensation for an extended time. Repeating either of these techniques many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Many individuals{{who|date=January 2014}} assert that orgasm control is more often possible with [[masturbation]]. This is a direct result of the fact that one is then able to control the intensity and duration of stimulation without having to rely on the partner stopping or changing the type of stimulation in order to postpone the orgasm. Masturbation is then the easy way to learn one's limits and could also be seen as the starting point in the technique of orgasm control.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orgasm control is most easily learned through solitary masturbation, although many individuals enjoy including elements of orgasm control in sex with a partner. Masturbation provides the individual with the opportunity of learning about their bodies and the amount of pleasure they can experience without reaching orgasm. Self-stimulation can help both men and women acknowledge the limits of their body and the techniques that may help them in controlling their orgasms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As it has been described by Steve Bodansky and Vera Bodansky in ''Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure'', masturbation practiced with the aim of orgasm control must be carried on with the purpose of making every stroke feel exquisite and not to relieve tension, as 'simple' masturbation does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JqiXUjILAlQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=steve+and+orgasm+familiarity#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%205&amp;f=false|title=Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure|date=2000-11-01|accessdate= 2010-07-27|isbn=9780897932899|author1=Bodansky|first1=Steve|last2=Bodansky|first2=Vera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to practice this other type of masturbation, the same authors suggest gradual stimulation of the [[genitals]] and then making connections between the primary area ([[Human penis|penis]] or [[clitoris]]) and the secondary area ([[lip]]s, [[nipple]] or other part of the body that is an [[erogenous zone]]). The connection between the two areas is established once the individual stimulates them with exactly the same moves of the same intensity.

'''Electrochemical engineering''' is the branch of chemical engineering dealing with the technological applications of electrochemical phenomena, such as electrosynthesis of chemicals, [[electrowinning]] and refining of metals,  flow batteries and [[fuel cells]], surface modification by electrodeposition, electrochemical separations and corrosion. This discipline is an overlap between [[electrochemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

According with the [[IUPAC]], the term ''electrochemical engineering'' is reserved for electricity intensive processes for industrial or energy storage applications, and should not be confused with ''applied electrochemistry'', which comprises small batteries, amperometric sensors, microfluidic devices, microelectrodes, solid-state devices, voltammetry at disc electrodes, etc. 

More than 6% of the electricity is consumed by large-scale electrochemical operations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bebelis|first1=S.|last2=Bouzek|first2=K.|last3=Cornell|first3=A.|last4=Ferreira|first4=M.G.S.|last5=Kelsall|first5=G.H.|last6=Lapicque|first6=F.|last7=Ponce de León|first7=C.|last8=Rodrigo|first8=M.A.|last9=Walsh|first9=F.C.|title=Highlights during the development of electrochemical engineering|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=October 2013|volume=91|issue=10|pages=1998–2020|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2013.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Electrochemical engineering (corrected).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the relationship between electrochemical engineering and other disciplines.]]

Electrochemical engineering combines the study of heterogeneous charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interphases with the development of practical materials and processes. Fundamental  considerations include electrode materials and the kinetics of redox species. The development of the technology involves the study of the electrochemical reactors, their potential and current distribution, mass transport conditions, hydrodynamics, geometry and components as well as the quantification of its overall performance in terms of reaction yield, conversion efficiency, and energy efficiency. Industrial developments require further reactor and process design, fabrication methods, testing and product development.

Electrochemical engineering considers current distribution, fluid flow, mass transfer, and the kinetics of the electro reactions in order to design efficient electrochemical reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=John|title=Engineering design of electrochemical systems|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|date=1968|volume=60|issue=4|pages=12–27|doi=10.1021/ie50700a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most electrochemical operations are performed in filter-press reactors with parallel plate electrodes or, less often, in stirred tanks with rotating cylinder electrodes. Fuel cell and flow battery stacks are types of filter-press reactors. Most of them are continuous operations.

==History==
[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]

This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering as electrical power sources became available in the mid 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating for the first time the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 [[Charles Martin Hall]] developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, [[Hamilton Castner]] improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. [[Charles Frederick Burgess]] developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later ran a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Electrochemistry Books Published Before 1950|url=http://knowledge.electrochem.org/estir/old-books.htm|publisher=The Electrochemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Second World War, interest focused towards the fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the [[potentiostat]] (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance was provided by the work of [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Veniamin Levich]] in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time "The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering" as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=C.|title=The scope of electrochemical engineering|journal=Advances in Electrochemistry and Electrochemical Engineering|volume=2|year=1962|pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the "father of electrochemical engineering" by the [[Electrochemical Society]], was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, [[John Newman (scientist)|John Newman]] pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Alkire, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and industrial electrochemical reactors.

The history of electrochemical engineering has been summarised by Wendt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendt|first1=H.|last2=Kreysa|first2=G.|title=The Scope and History of Electrochemical Engineering|journal=Electrochemical Engineering|pages=1-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03851-2_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapicque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapicque|first1=F.|title=Electrochemical Engineering: An Overview of its Contributions and Promising Features|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=2004|volume=82|issue=12|pages=1571–1574|doi=10.1205/cerd.82.12.1571.58046}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stankovic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankovic|first1=V.|title=Electrochemical Engineering - its appearance, evolution and present status.

'''Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs''' (Kode Technology) are [[Amphiphile|amphiphatic]], water [[wikt:dispersible|dispersible]] biosurface engineering constructs that can be used to engineer the surface of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[virus]]es and organisms, or to modify solutions and non-biological surfaces with bioactives.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic glycolipid-like constructs as tools for glycobiology research, diagnostics, and as potential therapeutics|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0006297915070068|journal = Biochemistry (Moscow)|date = 2015-07-16|issn = 0006-2979|pages = 857–871|volume = 80|issue = 7|doi = 10.1134/S0006297915070068|language = en|first = E.

FSL Kode constructs with all these aforementioned features are also known as Kode Constructs.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The process of modifying surfaces with FSL Kode constructs is known as "koding" and the resultant "koded" [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[virus]]es and [[liposome]]s are respectively known as [[kodecytes]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; and [[kodevirions]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;.

==Technology description==

All [[Cell membrane|living surfaces]] are decorated with a diverse range of complex molecules, which are key modulators of [[Cell signaling|chemical communications]] and other functions such as protection, [[Cell adhesion|adhesion]], [[infectivity]], [[apoptosis]], etc. Functional-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) Kode constructs can be [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] to mimic the bioactive components present on biological surfaces, and then re-present them in novel ways.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

The architecture of an FSL Kode construct, as implicit in the name, consists of three components - a functional head group, a spacer, and a lipid tail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This structure is analogous to a [[Lego minifigure]] in that, they have three structural components, with each component having a separate purpose.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; In the examples shown in all the figures, a Lego '[[minifig]]' has been used for the analogy. However, it should be appreciated that this is merely a representation and the true structural similarity is significantly varied between Lego minifigures and FSL Kode constructs ''(fig 1)''. The functional group of an FSL is equivalent to a Lego minifigure head, with both being at the extremity and carrying the character functional components. The spacer of the FSL is equivalent to the body of the Lego minifigure and the arms on the minifigure are representative of substitutions which may be engineered into the chemical makeup of the spacer. The lipid of the FSL anchors it to lipid membranes and gives the FSL construct its [[amphiphile|amphiphatic]] nature which can cause it to self-assemble. Because the lipid tail can act directly as an anchor it is analogous to the legs of a Lego minifigure.

==Flexible design==
The functional group, the spacer and the lipid tail components of the FSL Kode construct can each be individually designed resulting in FSL Kode constructs with specific biological functions.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; The functional head group is usually the bioactive component of the construct and the various spacers and lipids influence and effect its presentation, orientation and location on a surface. Critical to the definition of an FSL Kode construct is the requirement to be [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersible]] in water, and spontaneously and stably incorporate into cell membranes. Other lipid [[Bioconjugation|bioconjugates]] that include components similar to FSLs but do not have these features are not termed as Function-Spacer-Lipid Kode constructs.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;

===Functional groups&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===

As indicated in the figure, the function group analogous to the minifigures head can be arranged in different substances, the spacer analogous to the body of the minifigure (including the arms) can have a variety of different features, and the lipid or minifigure legs can be a variety of different lipids. Together the three components of function, spacer &amp; lipid represent the FSL construct.

* '''Other''' – chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] such as [[maleimide]],&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; [[Click chemistry|click]] residues, [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]], charged compounds

''Note 2: Mass – the mass that can be anchored by an FSL Kode constructs can range from 200 to &gt;1x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]''

===Spacers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The spacer is an integral part of the FSL Kode construct and gives it several important characteristics including water [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersibility]].&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Length''' – the spacer can be varied in length, for example 1.9&amp;nbsp;nm (Ad), 7.2&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG2), 11.5&amp;nbsp;nm (CMG4),&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; allowing for enhanced presentation of Functional groups at the biosurface.
* '''Optimizes 'F' presentation''' – The presentation of the bioactive (functional group) on a spacer reduces [[steric hindrance]] and increases the bioactive surfaces exposed and available for interactions
* '''Rigidity''' – the spacer can be modified to be either flexible or rigid depending upon desired characteristics
* '''Substitutions''' (represented by the leaves on the stalk) – the spacer can be modified both in [[charge (chemistry)|charge]], and [[Chemical polarity|polarity]].
* '''Branches''' – usually the spacer is linear, but it can also be branched including specific spacing of the branches to optimize presentation and interaction of the F group.
* '''Inert''' – important to the design of FSL Kode constructs is the biologically inert nature of the spacer. Importantly this feature means the S-L components of the constructs are unreactive with undiluted serum. Consequently, the constructs are compatible ''[[in vivo]]'' use, and can improve diagnostic assay sensitivity by allowing for the use of undiluted serum.

===Lipids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;===
The [[lipid]] tail is essential for enabling [[lipid membrane]] insertion and retention but also for giving the construct [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] characteristics that enable [[hydrophilic]] surface coating (due to formation of [[bilipid layer]]s). Different [[Lipid bilayer|membrane lipids]] that can be used to create FSLs have different membrane physiochemical characteristics and thus can affect biological function of the FSL. Lipids in FSL Kode constructs include:&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;
* '''Diacyl/diakyl''' e.g. DOPE
* '''Sterols''' e.g. cholesterol 
* '''Ceramides'''

The second and fourth with the longer stalks (spacers) representing the CMG2 7.2nm spacer and CMG4 11.5nm spacers respectively. The second and third constructs have the same spacers, but the lipid tail of the third construct is [[cholesterol]], rather than [[Phospholipid#Phospholipid derivatives|DOPE]]. 
The last three examples all based on CMG2 spacers (stalks), with a DOPE lipid tail (roots) are multimeric presentations of F. The first of these is a simple duplication of the F group, while the following has an additional spacer between the F groups. The final construct is a cluster presentation.
}}

One of the important functions of an FSL construct is that it can optimise the presentation of [[antigen]]s, both on cell surfaces and solid-phase membranes. This optimisation is achieved primarily by the spacer, and secondarily by the lipid tail. In a typical [[immunoassay]], the antigen is deposited directly onto the [[microplate]] surface and binds to the surface either in a random fashion, or in a preferred orientation depending on the residues present on the surface of this antigen. Usually this deposition process is uncontrolled. In contrast, the FSL Kode construct bound to a microplate presents the antigen away from the surface in an orientation with a high level of exposure to the environment. Furthermore, typical immunoassays use recombinant [[peptide]]s rather than discrete peptide antigens. As the recombinant peptide is many times bigger than the [[epitope]] of interest, a lot of undesired and unwanted peptide sequences are also represented on the microplate. These additional sequences may include unwanted microbial related sequences (as determined by a [[BLAST]] analysis) that can cause issues of low level cross-reactivity. Often the mechanism by which an immunoassay is able to overcome this low level activity is to dilute the serum so that the low level microbial reactive [[antibodies]] are not seen, and only high-level specific antibodies result in an interpretable result. In contrast, FSL Kode constructs usually use specifically selected peptide fragments (up to 40 amino acids),&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; thereby overcoming cross-reactivity with microbial sequences, and allowing for the use of undiluted [[serum (blood)|serum]] (which increases [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]]).

The F component can be further enhanced by presentation of it in [[multimeric]] formats and with specific spacing. The four types of multimeric format include linear repeating units, linear repeating units with spacing, clusters, and branching ''(Fig. 4)''.

The surface of the bilayer will be hydrophilic, allowing it to interact and anchor the FSLs to the hydrophilic surface.
}}

=== Amphiphilic FSL Kode construct ===

The FSL Kode construct by nature of its composition in possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] (or amphipathic). This characteristic determines the way in which the construct will interact with surfaces. When present in a [[solution]] they may form simple [[micelles]] or adopt more complex bilayer structures with two simplistic examples shown in ''Fig. 5a''. More complex structures are expected. The actual nature of FSL micelles has not been determined. However, based on normal structural function of micelles, it is expected that it will be determined in part by the combination of functional group, spacer and lipid together with temperature, [[concentration]], size and [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity]] for each FSL Kode construct type.

Surface coatings will occur via two theoretical mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a [[monolayer]] of FSL at the surface ''(Fig. 5b)''. Hydrophobic binding of the FSL will be via its hydrophobic lipid tail interacting directly with the hydrophobic ([[lipophilic]]) surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers as the lipid tail is unable to react with the hydrophilic surface. In this case the lipids will induce the formation of a bilayer, the surface of which will be hydrophilic. This hydrophilic membrane will then interact directly with the hydrophilic surface and will probably encapsulate [[fibres]]. This hydrophilic bilayer binding is the expected mechanism by which FSLs are able to bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c"/&gt; and glass fibres ''(Fig. 5c)'' and ''(Fig. 9)''.

After labeling of the surface with the selected F bioactive(s) the constructs will be present and orientated at the membrane surface. It is expected that the FSL will be highly mobile within the membrane and the choice of lipid tail will effect is relative partitioning within the membrane.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; The construct unless it has [[Lipid bilayer phase behavior|flip-flop behavior]] is expected to remain surface presented. However, the modification is not permanent in living cells and constructs will be lost (consumed) at a rate proportional to the activity at the membrane and [[Cell division|division rate of the cell]] (with dead cells remaining highly labeled).&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; Additionally, when present ''in vivo'' with serum lipids FSLs will elute from the membrane into the plasma at a rate of about 1% per hour.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; In fixed cells or inactive cells (e.g. red cells) stored in serum free media the constructs are retained normally.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;

Liposomes are easy koded by simply adding FSL Kode constructs into the preparation. Contacting koded liposomes with microplates or other surfaces can cause the labeling of the microplate surface.

=== Non-biologic surface interaction ===
Non-biologic surface coatings will occur via two mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic interaction of the lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers, which probably either encapsulate fibres or being via the hydrophilic F group. This is the expected mechanism by which FSLs bind to fibrous membranes such as paper&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; and glass fibres. A recent study has found that when FSL Kode constructs are optimised, could in a few seconds glycosylate almost any non-biological surface including metals, glass, plastics, rubbers, and other polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultra-Fast Glyco-Coating of Non-Biological Surfaces|url = http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/1/118|journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences|date = 2016-01-16|pages = 118|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/ijms17010118|language = en|first = Eleanor|last = Williams|first2 = Katie|last2 = Barr|first3 = Elena|last3 = Korchagina|first4 = Alexander|last4 = Tuzikov|first5 = Stephen|last5 = Henry|first6 = Nicolai|last6 = Bovin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology features ==

The technological features of FSL Kode constructs and the koding process can be summarized as follows:
* '''Rapid and simple''' – simple contact for 10–120 minutes and constructs spontaneously and stably incorporate – no washing required.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Replicable''' – same variables (time, temperature, concentration) equals the same result.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;
* '''Toxicity''' – FSL constructs are [[biocompatible]], disperse into biological solutions without [[solvents]], detergents. They label non-covalently and are non-genetic. Normal [[vitality]] and functionality is maintained in modified cells/virions/organisms.&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Toxicity/vitality experiments in small laboratory animals, [[zebrafish]], [[cell culture]]s, [[spermatozoa]] and [[embryos]] find no [[toxic]] effects within physiological ranges.
* '''Amphiphilic''' – the [[amphiphilic]] nature of the FSL Kode construct makes them water dispersible (clear solution of micelles), yet once interacted with a membrane they insert/coat and become water resistant
* '''Variable design''' – a single F can be presented in more than 100 ways by varying the spacer and lipid.
* '''High biovisibility''' – as the spacer holds the F moiety away for the membrane it is able to achieve increased sensitivity, specificity and reactivity can be optimized by use of multiple and variable biomarker presentations on the same surface.
* '''Additive''' – FSL modification is compatible with other technologies allowing users to add additional features to cells/viruses/organisms/surfaces already modified by more traditional methods. Multiple FSL constructs may be added to a surface simultaneously by simply creating a mix of FSL Kode constructs. Constructs insert into living or fixed cell ([[Glutaraldehyde#Fixative|glutaraldehyde]]) membranes. 
[[File:RFG maleimide construction.svg|thumb|''Fig. 8'' FSLs can be easily created from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest. The mixing of a cysteine containing peptide with FSL-RFG(Maleimide), in [[N-Methylmorpholine|4MMF]] buffer, allows the peptide to react with the [[maleimide]] residue of the FSL (through the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic addition reaction]]). Following overnight incubation then vacuum drying, an FSL peptide is created. No purification is required.|400x400px]]
* '''Simple FSL peptide synthesis''' – there is a reactive-functional-group FSL Kode construct with maleimide as its functional group which can be used for preparation of FSLs from [[cysteine]]-containing peptides, proteins or any other [[thiol]]s of biological interest.&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012a" /&gt; The effective synthetic approach is based on the well-known [[Michael reaction|Michael nucleophilic]] addition to maleimides ''(Fig. 7)''.
* '''Synthetic "Gylcolipids"''' – one family of the FSL constructs are synthetic [[glycolipid]]s with well-defined hydrophobic tails and carbohydrate head groups

=== Koded membranes surfaces and solutions ===
FSL constructs have a wide range of uses and they have been used to modify the following:
* '''Cells''' – [[blood cell]]s,&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frame2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgakopoulos2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; [[Cell culture|culture lines]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[embryos]],&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; [[spermatozoa]]&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt;
* '''Viruses'''&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; – influenza,&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; [[measles]], [[varicella]]
* '''Organisms''' – [[parasite]]s, [[microbe]]s, [[zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt;
* '''Liposomes''' – also micelles, lipid particles&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;
* '''Surfaces/fibres''' – hydrophobic or hydrophilic membranes/fibres, paper,&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; [[nitrocellulose]], cotton, silk, glass, [[Teflon]], [[silica]], magnetic beads (microspheres)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rapid biofunctionalization of magnetic beads with function-spacer-lipid constructs|url = http://sepmag.eu/blog/bid/401297/Rapid-biofunctionalization-of-magnetic-beads-with-function-spacer-lipid-constructs|website = sepmag.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
* '''Solutions''' – saline, plasma/serum, culture media

== Methodology for FSL use (koding) ==
[[File:Preparation of kodecytes and kodevirions.svg|thumb|''Fig. 9'' Preparation of [[kodecytes]]/[[kodevirions]]. Simply mix cells/virions with an FSL solution (containing 1 or more FSLs) and incubate for 10–120 minutes at 37°C (or at temperatures as low as 4°C). The constructs will spontaneously incorporate into the membrane and no further steps are required.|400x400px]]
FSL constructs, when in solution ([[Saline (medicine)|saline]]) and in contact, will spontaneously incorporate into cell and virus membranes.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The methodology involves simply preparing a solution of FSL construct(s) in the range of 1–1000 [[µg]]/[[millilitre|mL]]. The actual concentration will depend on the construct and the quantity of construct required in the membrane. One part of FSL solution is added to one part of cells (up to 100% [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]) and they are incubated at a set temperature within the range of 4–37&amp;nbsp;°C (39–99&amp;nbsp;°F) depending on temperature compatibility of the cells being modified. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of FSL insertion into the membrane. For red blood cells, at 37&amp;nbsp;°C incubation for 2 hours achieves &gt;95% insertion with at least 50% insertion being achieved within 20 minutes. In general, FSL insertion time of 4 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 4&amp;nbsp;°C gives results similar to 1 hour at 37&amp;nbsp;°C for carbohydrate based FSLs inserting into red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The resultant kodecytes or kodevirions do not required to be washed, however this option should be considered if an excess of FSL construct is used in the koding process.

== Applications ==
FSL Kode constructs have been used for research and development, [[diagnostic]] products, and are currently being investigated as potential [[therapeutic]] agents.

=== Kodecytes ===
{{main article|Kodecyte#Applications}}

FSL have been used to create human red cell kodecytes that have been used to detect and identify blood group allo-antibodies&lt;ref name="Heathcote2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadarajan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry2011" /&gt; as [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] sub-group mimics,&lt;ref name="Hult2012" /&gt; ABO quality control systems,&lt;ref name="Henry2009" /&gt; [[serologic]] teaching kits&lt;ref name="Henry2012b" /&gt; and a [[syphilis]] diagnostic.&lt;ref name="Chesla2010" /&gt; Kodecytes have also demonstrated that FSL-FLRO4 is a suitable reagent for labelling [[packed red blood cells]] (PRBC) at any point during routine storage and look to facilitate the development of immunoassays and transfusion models focused on addressing the mechanisms involved in [[Transfusion-related immunomodulation|tansfusion-related immunomodulation]] (TRIM).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Murine kodecytes have been experimentally used to determine ''in vivo'' cell survival,&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; and create model [[Transfusion reaction#Complications of transfusions|transfusion reactions]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2011b" /&gt; Zebrafish kodecytes have been used to determine real time ''in vivo'' cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lan2012" /&gt; Kodecytes have been used to create influenza diagnostics.&lt;ref name="Korchagina2012" /&gt; Kodecytes which have been modified with FSL-GB3 were unable to be infected with the [[HIV virus]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Branch2008" /&gt;

=== Kodevirions ===
{{main article|Kodevirions#Applications}}

Kodevirions are FSL modified viruses. Several FSL Kode constructs have been used to label viruses to assist in their [[Flow cytometry|flow-cytometric visualisation]]&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; and to track them real time distribution in animal models.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt; They have also been used to modify the surface of viruses with the intention of targeting them to be used to attach [[tumor]]s ([[oncolytic]]).&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;

=== Kodesomes ===
Kodesomes are liposomes that have been decorated with FSL Kode constructs. These have been used to deposit FSL constructs onto microplates to create diagnostic [[assay]]s. They also have the potential for therapeutic use.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011" /&gt;

=== Koded solutions ===
These are solutions containing FSL Kode constructs where the construct will exist as a clear micellular dispersion. FSL-GB3 as a solution/gel has been used to inhibit HIV infection&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; and to neutralise [[Shiga toxin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison2010" /&gt; FSL blood group A as a solution has been used to neutralise circulating antibodies in a [[mouse]] model and allow incompatible blood group A ([[murine]] kodecytes) transfusion.&lt;ref name="Oliver2011a" /&gt; This model experiment was used to demonstrate the potential of FSLs to neutralise circulating antibody and allow for incompatible blood transfusion or [[organ transplantation]].&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt;

=== Koded surfaces ===
[[File:Inkjet Printed FSLs.jpg|thumb|''Fig. 10'' FSL constructs can be printed with a [[Inkjet printer|standard desktop inkjet printer]] directly onto paper to create [[immunoassay]]s. Image is a typical example of an inkjet printed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) where 12 different FSL constructs were printed as identifying codes on paper and then reacted against different samples. The antibody activity in the samples can be identified by appearance of words identifying the target antigen. An empty inkjet cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, barcodes, or graphics are printed. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Perspex]] template is adhered to the surface to create [[Microtiter plate|reaction wells]]. The method is then a standard [[immunoassay|EIA]] procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical EIA procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA [[Immunoassay#Detection Antibody|detection antibody]], incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/BCIP precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing. The end result is stable for years.|541x541px]]

All FSL Kode constructs disperse in water and are therefore compatible with [[inkjet printer]]s. FSL constructs can be printed with a standard desktop inkjet printer directly onto paper to create immunoassays.&lt;ref name="Henry2012c" /&gt; An empty ink cartridge is filled with an FSL construct and words, [[barcode]]s, or graphics are printed. A [[Perspex]] template is adhered to the surface to create reaction wells. The method is then a standard [[Immunoassay|EIA]] procedure, but blocking of serum is not required and undiluted serum can be used. A typical procedure is as follows: add serum, incubate, wash by immersion, add secondary EIA conjugate, incubate, wash, add [[Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride|NBT]]/[[BCIP]] precipitating substrate and stop the reaction when developed by washing ''(Fig. 9)''. The end result is stable for years.

'''''Health Education &amp; Behavior''''' is a bimonthly [[peer-reviewed]] [[healthcare journal]] covering applied [[Behavioral science|behavioral]] and [[social science]] in [[public health]] published by [[SAGE Publications]]. It is an official journal of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE).

==History==
The journal was established in 1957 as ''Health Education Monographs'' which was produced on an occasional basis with no set publishing schedule until 1974, when it became a quarterly publication with standard volume numbering and pagination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zimmerman |first=M. A. |date=2016-07-01 |title=Message From the Editor |journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1177/109019819802500101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of 1974 became volume 2, issue 1. All previous issues covering issues 1 to 36, from 1957 to 1973, were designated to constitute volume 1. During this period, ''Health Education Monographs'' was printed by various small publishing companies or cooperatively by SOPHE and the [[World Health Organization]]. No volume was published in 1979 due to extensive ongoing changes, including a new publisher, editor, and format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1980, the journal was renamed ''Health Education Quarterly'' and a publication agreement was negotiated with Human Sciences Press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] became the publisher with volume 10 in 1983 and the journal changed to its present publisher, SAGE Publications, in 1995. In 1997, the journal expanded to six issues annually to accommodate the growing volume of submissions and was renamed ''Health Education &amp; Behavior''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed by [[CAB Abstracts]], [[CINAHL]], [[Current Contents]]/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, [[Global Health]], [[Index Medicus]]/[[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]], [[ProQuest|ProQuest databases]], [[Psychological Abstracts]], [[PsycINFO]], [[PsycLIT]], [[SafetyLit]], [[Scopus]], [[Social Sciences Citation Index]], and [[Sociological Abstracts]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal's 2015 [[impact factor]] is 2.312.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Health Education &amp; Behavior|title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Himiko''' is a [[interstellar cloud|large gas cloud]] found at [[redshift]] of z=6.6 that predates similar [[Lyman-alpha blob]]s. At time of discovery, researchers said it "may represent the most massive object ever discovered in the early universe."&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090422-space-blob.html|title=Giant Mystery Blob Discovered Near Dawn of Time|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|date=2009-04-22|publisher=[[SPACE.com]]|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]] at [[redshift]] z=6.595, about 12.9 billion [[light years]] from Earth, or about {{val|75|e=21}} miles ({{val|122|e=21}} kilometers).

==Characteristics==
This nebular gas cloud is thought to be a [[protogalaxy]], caught in the act of formation. There have been no spectroscopic signatures of anything other than hydrogen or helium, and its luminance cannot be ascribed to gravitational lensing, black holes or exterior excitation. The lack of any chemical signatures other than hydrogen and helium illustrate the extreme primitiveness of the object, and early enough so as not to be polluted by carbon signatures from young stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116113517.htm |title= Astronomers Probe the Primitive Nature of a Distant 'Space Blob' |date= 16 January 2014 |publisher= [[Science Daily]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
It is 55,000 light years across (half the diameter of our galaxy), and at the time of discovery, said to "hold more than 10 times as much mass as the next largest object found in the early universe, or roughly the equivalent mass of 40 billion Suns".&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

==Discovery==
Masami Ouchi, a researcher at the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena, California, stated "I have never heard about any [similar] objects that could be resolved at this distance...[i]t's kind of record-breaking."

==Name==
The object was named by a Japanese scientist after the 3rd-century Japanese shaman queen [[Himiko (queen)|Himiko]].&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciw.edu/news/mysterious_space_blob_discovered_cosmic_dawn |title=Mysterious Space Blob Discovered at Cosmic Dawn |date=22 April 2009 |publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hot Laboratory and Waste Management Center''' (HLWMC), is dedicated for [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]] as well as development of expertise in the back end of [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and [[radioisotope]] production for medical and industrial applications. The HLWMC was established in 1980, owned and operated by the [[Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority]] (AEA) in [[Inshas]], northeast of Cairo.&lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Laboratory and Waste Management Center (HLWMC)|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/377/|website=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|publisher=[[monterey Institute of International Studies#James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS)|James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Laboratory and Waste Management Center (HLWMC)|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/egypt/facility/nrc.htm|website=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=11 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic scriptures==

In Islamic literature, blasphemy is of many types, and there are many different words for it: ''sabb'' (insult) and ''shatm'' (abuse, vilification), ''takdhib'' or ''tajdif'' (denial), ''iftira'' (concoction), ''la`n'' or ''la'ana'' (curse) and ''ta`n'' (accuse, defame).&lt;ref&gt;See:

''Iranian Studies'' '''37'''(1). pp. 47–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic literature, the term "blasphemy" sometimes also overlaps with ''[[Kafir|kufr]]'' ("unbelief"), ''fisq'' (depravity), ''isa'ah'' (insult), and ''ridda'' (apostasy).&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, in Hent de Vries (ed.). ''Religion: Beyond a Concept''. Fordham University Press (2008). {{ISBN|978-0823227242}}. pp. 589–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lw/&gt;

===Quran===
Not only does the Quran not prescribe any earthly punishment for blasphemy, it actually advocates a non-violent response.&lt;ref&gt;Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty, Mustafa Akyol, 2013 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The commanded response is only to "not sit with" those who mock the religion. For example:

{{quote|When you hear God’s revelations disbelieved in and mocked at, do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|4|140}}||}} 

But a variety of punishments, including death, have been instituted in Islamic Jurisprudence, that draw their sources from hadith literature &lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan. Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture (editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker). {{ISBN|978-1610691772}}, pp. 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, 2004 pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadiths===
Sources in hadith literature allege that [[Muhammad]] ordered the execution of [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. ''The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf.'' Oriens, Vol. 32. (1990), pp. 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Badr]], Ka'b had incited the Quraysh against Muhammad, and also urged them to seek vengeance against Muslims. Another person executed was Abu Rafi', who had actively propagandized against Muslims immediately before the [[Battle of Ahzab]]. Both of these men were guilty of insulting Muhammad, and both were guilty of inciting violence. While some{{Who?|date=April 2017}} have explained that these two men were executed for blaspheming against Muhammad, an alternative explanation{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} is that they were executed for treason and causing disorder (''[[fasad]]'') in society.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Khan (2014), "Blasphemy against the Prophet," ''Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God'', (vol. 1 pp. 62). [[ABC-CLIO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hadith{{Which?|date=April 2017}} tells of a man who killed his slave because she persisted in insulting Muhammad. Upon hearing this, Muhammad is reported to have exclaimed: "Do you not bear witness that her blood is futile!" (''anna damah hadarun'')&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; This expression can be read as meaning that the killing was unnecessary, implying that Muhammad condemned it.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; However, most hadith specialists interpreted it as voiding the obligation of paying the blood money which would normally be due to the woman's next of kin.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; Another hadith reports Muhammad using an expression which clearly indicates the latter meaning: &lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: A Jewess used to abuse the Prophet and disparage him. A man strangled her till she died. The Apostle of Allah declared that no recompense was payable for her blood.|{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|38|4349}}  }}

==Punishment==

===Traditional jurisprudence===
{{Fiqh |criminal}}
The [[Quran]] does not explicitly mention any worldly punishment for blasphemy (''sabb allah'' or ''sabb al-rasul''). Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) of Sunni and Shia [[madhab]]s have declared different punishments for the religious crime of blasphemy, and they vary between schools. These are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Saeed"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Saeed  | first = Abdullah  |author2=Hassan Saeed  | title = Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Company  | year = 2004  | location = Burlington VT  | pages = 37–39  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhold, Lutz.

:[[Hanafi]] – views blasphemy as synonymous with apostasy, and therefore, accepts the repentance of apostates.

He must repent, or else is killed. And this is the same for the woman, except Abu Hanifa said: Do not kill the woman, but coerce her back to Islam.”&lt;/ref&gt; If a non-Muslim commits blasphemy, his punishment must be a [[tazir]] (discretionary, can be death, arrest, caning, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi (933), Mukhtasar Ikhtilaf al-Ulama, vol. 3, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

The Islamic law considers blasphemy against Muhammad a more severe offense than blasphemy against God. Repentance can lead to forgiveness by God when God is blasphemed, however since Muhammad is no longer alive, forgiveness is not possible when Muhammad is blasphemed, and the Muslim community must punish his blasphemy by avenging blasphemer's death.&lt;ref name = "Saeed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David A.

A convicted blasphemer may, among other penalties, lose all legal rights. The loss of rights may cause a blasphemer's marriage to be dissolved, religious acts to be rendered worthless, and claims to property—including any inheritance—to be rendered void. Repentance, in some Fiqhs, may restore lost rights except for marital rights; lost marital rights are regained only by remarriage. Women have blasphemed and repented to end a marriage. Muslim women may be permitted to repent, and may receive a lesser punishment than would befall a Muslim man who committed the same offense.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"/&gt; Most Muslim-majority countries have some form of blasphemy law and some of them have been compared to blasphemy laws in European countries (Britain, Germany, Finland etc.).&lt;ref name="Böwering"/&gt; However, in five countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, blasphemy is punishable by execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OcriBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |page= 83 |title= Political Secularism, Religion, and the State: A Time Series Analysis of Worldwide Data |author= Jonathan Fox |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, more than a thousand people have been convicted of blasphemy since the 1980s; though none have been executed.&lt;ref name="Böwering"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC&amp;pg=PA72 |page=72 |title= The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought |editors= Gerhard Böwering, Patricia Crone, Mahan Mirza |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blasphemy as apostasy==
{{Main|Apostasy in Islam}}
Blasphemy has historically been seen as an evidence of rejection of Islam, that is, the religious crime of [[apostasy]]. Some jurists believe that blasphemy automatically implies a Muslim has left the fold of Islam.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p. 38–39}} A Muslim may find himself accused of being a blasphemer, and thus an apostate on the basis of one action or utterance.{{sfn|Saeed|2004|p.48}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Blasphemy: Islamic Concept |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion |volume = 2 |pages = 974–76 |publisher = Thomson Gale |location = Farmington Hills, MI |year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain hadiths, after Mecca's fall [[Muhammad]] ordered a number of enemies executed. Based on this early jurists postulated that ''sabb al-Nabi'' (abuse of the Prophet) was a crime "so heinous that repentance was disallowed and summary execution was required".&lt;ref name=kadri-252&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sadakat Kadri]] writes that the actual prosecutions for blasphemy in the Muslim historical record "are vanishingly infrequent". One of the "few known cases" was that of a Christian accused of insulting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. It ended in an acquittal in 1293, though it was followed by a protest against a decision led by the famed and strict jurist [[Ibn Taymiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel, ''Muslim Theologian's Response'', pp. 69–71)&lt;/ref&gt;

New York: Oxford University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several Islamic nations have argued in the United Nations that blasphemy against Muhammad is unacceptable, and that laws should be passed worldwide to proscribe it. In September 2012, the [[Organisation of Islamic Conference]] (OIC), who has sought for a universal blasphemy law over a decade, revived these attempts. Separately, the Human Rights Commission of the OIC called for "an international code of conduct for media and social media to disallow the dissemination of incitement material". Non-Muslim nations that do not have blasphemy laws, have pointed to abuses of blasphemy laws in Islamic nations, and have disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/radical-islam’s-global-reaction-push-blasphemy-laws Michael Totten, Radical Islam's global reaction: the push for blasphemy laws (January/February 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-protests-religions-blasphemy-idUSBRE88I1EG20120919|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/Blasphemy_Cases.pdf|format=PDF|title=Blasphemy Laws Exposed – The Consequences of Criminalizing Defamation of Religions |year=2012|website=humanrightsfirst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, controversies raised in the non-Muslim world, especially over depictions of [[Muhammad]], questionning issues relating to the [[religious offense]] to minorities in secular countries. A key case was the 1989 fatwa against English author [[Salman Rushdie]] for his 1988 book entitled ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', the title of which refers to an account that Muhammad, in the course of revealing the Quran, [[Satanic Verses|received a revelation from Satan and incorporated it therein]] until made by Allah to retract it. Several translators of his book into foreign languages have been murdered.&lt;ref name="Rushdie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blasphemy Salman Rushdie |publisher=Constitutional Rights Foundation |year=2009 |url=http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |accessdate=10 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818052403/http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/blasphemy-salman-rushdie.html |archivedate=18 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, many supporters of Salman Rushdie and his publishers advocated unrestricted freedom of expression and the abolition of the [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|British blasphemy laws]]. As a response, [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] wrote ''[[A Brief History of Blasphemy]]'' in which he discussed freedom to publish books that may cause distress to minorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In September 2007, Bangladeshi cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] depicted in the daily ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name. He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law but groups said the cartoon ridiculed Muhammad, torched copies of the paper and demanded that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. As a result, Bangladeshi police detained Rahman and confiscated copies of ''Prothom Alo'' in which the cartoon appeared.

In June 2009, Noreen was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them. She was subsequently accused of insulting the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a charge she denies, and was arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a [[Sheikhupura]] judge sentenced her to death.

The verdict, which was reached in a district court and would need to be upheld by a superior court, has received worldwide attention. Various petitions, including one that received 400,000 signatures, were organized to protest Noreen's imprisonment, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed.

====Protests against depicting Muhammad====
[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|260px|A 17th century copy of a 14th-century Persian manuscript image of [[Muhammad]] prohibiting [[Nasi']], one of the [[depictions of Muhammad]] which raised objections]]

In December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Few weeks later, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing [[depictions of Muhammad]]. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of Muhammad had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the [[English Wikipedia]]'s ''Muhammad'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328966,00.html |title=Muslims Protest Wikipedia Images of Muhammad |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/books/05wiki.html |title=Wikipedia Islam Entry Is Criticized |author=Noam Cohen |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century [[Ilkhanate]] manuscript image depicting Muhammad as he prohibited [[Nasīʾ]].&lt;ref&gt;MS Arabe 1489.

====The Muhammad cartoons crisis====
{{Muhammad cartoons}}

In September 2005, in the tense aftermath of the assassination of Dutch film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], killed for his views on Islam, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]] to find an illustrator to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name="hansen&amp;hundevadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=John|title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne|year=2006|publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|isbn=87-7692-092-5|first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bluitgen|first=Kåre|title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv|year=2006|publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk|isbn=978-87-638-0049-5|page=268|url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|others=Anonymous illustrator|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that three artists declined his proposal, which was interpreted as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of reprisals, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news|date=17 September 2005|title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam")|newspaper=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/|accessdate=19 March 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news|date=19 February 2006|title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html|first=Flemming|last=Rose|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the experiment, Danish scholar [[Peter Hervik]] wrote that it disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark, because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hervik|first=Peter|title=The Danish Muhammad Cartoon Conflict|journal=Current Themes in IMER Research|year=2012|volume=13|url=http://www.mah.se/upload/Forskningscentrum/MIM/CT/CT%2013.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=Malmö Institute for Studies of Migration, Diversity and Welfare (MIM)|issn=1652-4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'' stated that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists who reportedly declined his proposal, so his claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved, but that Bluitgen refused, making his initial claim impossible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Flemming Rose]], an editor at the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', invited professional illustrators to depict Muhammad as an experiment to see how much they felt threatened. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. On 30 September 2005, the ''Jyllands-Posten'' published 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the prophet Muhammad. One cartoon by [[Kurt Westergaard]] depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, which resulted in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] (or Muhammad cartoons crisis) ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henkel|first=Heiko|title=Fundamentally Danish?

"Those who have won are dictatorships in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, where they cut criminals' hands and give women no rights," Juste told The Associated Press. "The dark dictatorships have won."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cartoon-inflames-muslim-world/|title=Cartoon Inflames Muslim World|author=LLOYD VRIES|date=2 Feb 2006|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting the cartoon that initiated the diplomatic crisis, American scholar [[John E.

In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but foreign minister [[Laila Freivalds]] pressured the provider to shut the page down (in 2006, her involvement was revealed to the public and she had to resign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' republished the ''Jyllands-Posten'' cartoons of Muhammad.

In July 2007, art galleries in Sweden declined to show drawings of artist [[Lars Vilks]] depicting Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. While Swedish newspapers had published them already, the drawings gained international attention after the newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of them on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on the "right to ridicule a religion".&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular publication led to official condemnations from Iran,&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=Pakistan Condemns the Publication of Offensive Sketch in Sweden |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=4 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan,&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference.&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to ''[[Family Guy]]'' character [[Peter Griffin]] ("[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"). However, [[Comedy Central]] who airs the series rejected the scene and its creators reacted by satirizing [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability. In April 2010, animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] planned to make episodes satirizing controversies over previous episodes, including Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad following the 2005 Danish controversy. After they faced Internet death threats, Comedy Central modified their version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad. In reaction, cartoonist Molly Norris created the [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]], claiming that if many people draw pictures of Muhammad, threats to murder them all would become unrealistic. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Examples of blasphemy==
[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Salman Rushdie]] was accused of blasphemy and became the subject of a ''[[fatwā]]'' issued by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], in February 1989.]]
A variety of actions, speeches or behavior can constitute blasphemy in Islam. Some examples include insulting or cursing Allah, or Muhammad; mockery or disagreeable behavior towards beliefs and customs common in Islam; criticism of Islam's holy personages. [[Apostasy in Islam|Apostasy]], that is, the act of abandoning Islam, or finding faults or expressing doubts about Allah (''ta'til'') and Qur'an, rejection of Muhammed or any of his teachings, or leaving the Muslim community to become an atheist is a form of blasphemy. Questioning religious opinions (fatwa) and normative Islamic views can also be construed as blasphemous. Improper dress, drawing offensive cartoons, tearing or burning holy literature of Islam, creating or using music or painting or video or novels to mock or criticize Muhammad are some examples of blasphemous acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicp.ca/islamic-lessons/english/youth/the-islamic-education-series-book-5/chapter-of-belief/lesson-13-the-types-of-blasphemy-and-blasphemers/ Association of Islamic Charitable Projects, ''The Types of Blasphemy'' (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, D.

Individuals have been accused of blasphemy or of insulting Islam for a variety of actions and words.

A '''khanate''' or '''khaganate''' is a political entity ruled by a [[Khan (title)|khan]] or [[Khagan|khagan]]. This political entity is typical for people from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and it can be equivalent to [[tribe|tribal]] [[chiefdom]], [[principality]], [[monarchy|kingdom]] or [[empire]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[South Africa]]n [[sociologist]] specialising in the study of [[genocide]].

==Early life and legal career==

Kuper was born to a [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] family. His siblings included his sister Mary (d. 1948), who in later life directed the Johannesburg Legal Aid Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1950_9_BritishCommon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;

Kuper trained in law at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], receiving there his BA and LLB degrees.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt; As a lawyer, he represented African clients in human-rights cases, and also represented one of the country's early non-[[racial segregation|segregated]] [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt; He supported the establishment of South Africa's first [[legal aid]] charity.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;

==Wartime service==

Kuper served with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in Kenya, Egypt, and Italy, as an [[intelligence officer]], from 1940 to 1946.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; After the war he organised the National War Memorial Health Foundation, which provided social and medical services for disadvantaged people from all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

==Scholarly and political activities==

In 1947 Kuper went to the [[University of North Carolina]], where he earned an M.A. in sociology.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; He was subsequently appointed Lecturer in Sociology at the [[University of Birmingham]] in England.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

At Birmingham, Kuper directed a research project intended to help the city of [[Coventry]] recover from the bombing it received during World War II.&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; This project culminated in the publication of ''Living in Towns'' (1953).&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt; Kuper completed a doctorate in sociology at the University of Birmingham in 1952, and moved to [[Durban]], South Africa, as Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Natal]].&lt;ref name="snac" /&gt;

Kuper was an active opponent of [[apartheid]]. Under his headship, the Sociology Department at the [[University of Natal]] was the only [[Racial integration|integrated]] academic department in South Africa.{{sfn|van den Berghe|1989|pp=158-159}} Kuper and his colleague [[Fatima Meer]] were subjected to [[surveillance]] by the apartheid government, and classes taught in the department were infiltrated by government spies, resulting in a [[chilling effect]].{{sfn|van den Berghe|1989|p=170}}

During his time in Durban, Kuper co-founded the [[Liberal Party of South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|text=I remember only one thing ... I said to [Leo Kuper] that although this was the first time I had sat in the dock, I did not mind it at all. He said to me, with that gentle smile which was one of his great characteristics, "I don't like it at all."&lt;ref name="journctd" /&gt;}}

On 1 August 1957, all six defendants were acquitted on appeal.&lt;ref name="journctd" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1936, Kuper married anthropologist [[Hilda Beemer Kuper]], with whom he had two daughters:&lt;ref name="cdlib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-1994-05-27" /&gt; the international human rights lawyer Dr Jenny Kuper and the painter and sculptor Mary Kuper.&lt;ref name="hilda-odnb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4178">The '''Lincoln Theological Institute for the Study of Religion and Society''' (Lincoln Theological Institute), established in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionandcivilsociety.com/about-lti/ Lincoln Theological Institute website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a research centre at the [[University of Manchester]], UK. Its research focuses on theology, faith and society.

==History==
Founded in 1997 as the successor body to [[Lincoln Theological College]], the Lincoln Theological Institute was initially located at the [[University of Sheffield]]. In 2003, the Lincoln Theological Institute moved to the Department of Religions and Theology at the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/religionstheology/research/centres/ University of Manchester Department of Religions and Theology website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's first director, appointed in 1997, was [[Martyn Percy]]. He left in 2004 to become Principal at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon]]. He was succeeded in 2005 by Peter Manley Scott, who joined from the [[University of Gloucestershire]].

The Lincoln Theological Institute charity (chaired by Rt Revd [[Stephen Platten]], [[Bishop of Wakefield (diocese)|Bishop of Wakefield]]), funds the research activities of the Institute. It owns [[Chad Varah]] House on Drury Lane, Lincoln, the building occupied by [[Lincoln Theological College]] until it closed in 1995.

In a [[wireless communication]] system, the '''link margin''', measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is the difference between the receiver's sensitivity (i.e., the received power at which the receiver will stop working) and the expected minimum received power. A 15 dB link margin means that the system could tolerate an additional 15 dB of attenuation between the transmitter and the receiver, and it would still just barely work.

It is typical to design a system with at least a few dB of link margin, to allow for attenuation that is not modeled elsewhere. For example, a [[satellite communication]]s system operating in the tens of gigahertz might require additional link margin (vs. the [[link budget]] assuming lossless propagation), in order to ensure that it still works with the extra losses due to [[rain fade]] or other external factors.

A system with a -negative link margin would mean the system is insufficient to transfer data, usually this means a better receiver &lt;!-- or transmitter? --&gt; is needed, with improved sensitivity.  &lt;!-- or transmitting power? --&gt;

'''[[Liberal arts college]]s''' are primarily colleges or universities with an emphasis upon [[undergraduate]] study in the [[liberal arts]]. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Concise'' offers the following definition of the liberal arts as a, "college or university curriculum aimed at imparting general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  | last =  | title = Liberal Arts: Encyclopædia Britannica Concise| publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | date =  | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the genesis for what is known today as the liberal arts college began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philip  |last=Harriman |title=Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College |publisher=The Journal of Higher Education |year=1935  |jstor=1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is commonly associated with the [[United States]]. Liberal arts colleges are found in countries all over the world as well. See the list ([http://www.aacu.org/membership/list_geographic.cfm#INTL link]) of international members of the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] for other institutions offering liberal arts education programs.

The '''Mining Code''', '''Mining Law''' or '''Miners' Law''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Закон о рудницима}}) or '''Novo Brdo Code''' ({{lang|sr|Новобрдски законик}}),  is a compilation of laws on mining in the [[Serbian Despotate]], enacted by Despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] on 29 January 1412, formulated earlier in 1390. Apart from mining laws, there are legal provisions concerning the organization and life in [[Novo Brdo Fortress|Novo Brdo]] ({{lang|sr|Статут Новог Брда}}, the ''Statute of Novo Brdo''), a city which at that time was the largest mine in the Balkans. The compilation is survived in several later transcripts, of which a 16th-century illustrated manuscript is regarded the most important.

{{Multiplex techniques}}

[[File:Multiplexing diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Multiple low data rate signals are multiplexed over a single high data rate link, then demultiplexed at the other end]]

In [[telecommunications]] and [[computer networks]], '''multiplexing''' (sometimes contracted to '''muxing''') is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a [[shared medium]]. The aim is to share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several [[telephone call]]s may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated in [[#Telegraphy|telegraphy]] in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. In [[#Telephony|telephony]], [[George Owen Squier]] is credited with the development of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.

The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.

A device that performs the multiplexing is called a [[multiplexer]] (MUX), and a device that performs the reverse process is called a [[demultiplexer]] (DEMUX or DMX).

[[Inverse multiplexing]] (IMUX) has the opposite aim as multiplexing, namely to break one data stream into several streams, transfer them simultaneously over several communication channels, and recreate the original data stream.

==Types==
Multiple [[variable bit rate]] digital [[bit stream]]s may be transferred efficiently over a single fixed [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] channel by means of [[statistical multiplexing]]. This is an [[asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] mode time-domain multiplexing which is a form of time-division multiplexing.

Digital bit streams can be transferred over an analog channel by means of code-division multiplexing techniques such as [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (FHSS) and [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS).

In [[wireless communication]]s, multiplexing can also be accomplished through alternating [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] ([[Horizontal plane|horizontal]]/[[vertical direction|vertical]] or [[clockwise]]/[[counterclockwise]]) on each [[adjacent channel]] and satellite, or through [[phased array|phased multi-antenna array]] combined with a [[multiple-input multiple-output communications]] (MIMO) scheme.

===Space-division multiplexing===
In wired communication, [[Space-division multiple access|space-division multiplexing]], also known as Space-division multiple access is the use of separate point-to-point electrical conductors for each transmitted channel. Examples include an analogue stereo audio cable, with one pair of wires for the left channel and another for the right channel, and a multi-pair [[telephone cable]], a switched [[star network]] such as a telephone access network, a switched Ethernet network, and a [[mesh network]].

In wireless communication, space-division multiplexing is achieved with multiple antenna elements forming a [[phased array antenna]]. Examples are [[multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO), single-input and multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input and single-output (MISO) multiplexing.  An IEEE 802.11g wireless router with ''k'' antennas makes it in principle possible to communicate with ''k'' multiplexed channels, each with a peak bit rate of 54 Mbit/s, thus increasing the total peak bit rate by the factor ''k''. Different antennas would give different [[multi-path propagation]] (echo) signatures, making it possible for [[digital signal processing]] techniques to separate different signals from each other. These techniques may also be utilized for [[space diversity]] (improved robustness to fading) or [[beamforming]] (improved selectivity) rather than multiplexing.

===Frequency-division multiplexing===
[[File:Frequenzmultiplex001.svg|right|thumb|400px|Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM): The spectrum of each input signal is shifted to a distinct frequency range.]]
[[Frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM) is inherently an analog technology. FDM achieves the combining of several signals into one medium by sending signals in several distinct frequency ranges over a single medium. '''In FDM the signals are electrical signals.'''
One of the most common applications for FDM is traditional radio and television broadcasting from terrestrial, mobile or satellite stations, or cable television.  Only one cable reaches a customer's residential area, but the service provider can send multiple television channels or signals simultaneously over that cable to all subscribers without interference.  Receivers must tune to the appropriate frequency (channel) to access the desired signal.&lt;ref name = "Bates"&gt;{{citation | title = Voice and Data Communications | first1 = Regis J | first2 = Marcus | last1= Bates| last2 = Bates | year = 2007 | ISBN = 9780072257328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant technology, called [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] (WDM) is used in [[optical communication]]s.

===Time-division multiplexing===
[[File:Telephony multiplexer system.gif|right|thumb|400px|Time-division multiplexing (TDM).]]
[[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) is a digital (or in rare cases, analog) technology which uses time, instead of space or frequency, to separate the different data streams. TDM involves sequencing groups of a few bits or bytes from each individual input stream, one after the other, and in such a way that they can be associated with the appropriate receiver. If done sufficiently quickly, the receiving devices will not detect that some of the circuit time was used to serve another logical communication path.

Consider an application requiring four terminals at an airport to reach a central computer. Each terminal communicated at 2400 [[baud]], so rather than acquire four individual circuits to carry such a low-speed transmission, the airline has installed a pair of multiplexers. A pair of 9600 baud modems and one dedicated analog communications circuit from the airport ticket desk back to the airline data center are also installed.&lt;ref name = "Bates" /&gt; Some [[Proxy server#Web proxy servers|web proxy servers]] (e.g. [[polipo]]) use TDM in [[HTTP pipelining]] of multiple [[HTTP]] transactions onto the same [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP/IP connection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = rfc2068 - HTTP/1.1 |url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068 |accessdate = 2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carrier sense multiple access]] and [[multidrop]] communication methods are similar to time-division multiplexing in that multiple data streams are separated by time on the same medium, but because the signals have separate origins instead of being combined into a single signal, are best viewed as [[channel access method]]s, rather than a form of multiplexing.

TD is a legacy multiplexing technology still providing the backbone of most National fixed line Telephony networks in Europe, providing the 2m/bit voice and signalling ports on Narrow band Telephone exchanges such as the DMS100. Each E1 or 2m/bit TDM port provides either 30 or 31 speech timeslots in the case of CCITT7 signalling systems and 30 voice channels for customer connected Q931, DASS2, DPNSS, V5 and CASS signalling systems.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Polarization-division multiplexing ===
[[Polarization-division multiplexing]] uses the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of electromagnetic radiation to separate orthogonal channels. It is in practical use in both radio and optical communications, particularly in 100 Gbit/s per channel [[fiber optic transmission system]]s.

=== Orbital angular momentum multiplexing ===
[[Orbital angular momentum multiplexing]] is a relatively new and experimental technique for multiplexing multiple channels of signals carried using electromagnetic radiation over a single path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamburini|first=Fabrizio|last2=Mari|first2=Elettra|last3=Sponselli|first3=Anna|last4=Thidé|first4=Bo|last5=Bianchini|first5=Antonio|last6=Romanato|first6=Filippo|date=2012-01-01|title=Encoding many channels on the same frequency through radio vorticity: first experimental test|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/14/i=3/a=033001|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=033001|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/3/033001|issn=1367-2630}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can potentially be used in addition to other physical multiplexing methods to greatly expand the transmission capacity of such systems. {{As of|2012}} it is still in its early research phase, with small-scale laboratory demonstrations of bandwidths of up to 2.5 Tbit/s over a single light path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18551284|title='Twisted light' carries 2.5 terabits of data per second|publisher=BBC News|date=2012-06-25|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a controversial subject in the academic community, with many claiming it is not a new method of multiplexing, but rather a special case of space-division multiplexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamagnone|first1=Michele|last2=Silva|first2=Joana S.|last3=Capdevila|first3=Santiago|last4=Mosig|first4=Juan R.|last5=Perruisseau-Carrier|first5=Julien|title=The orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing controversy: OAM as a subset of MIMO|journal=2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)|date=2015|pages=1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code-division multiplexing===
[[Code division multiplexing]] (CDM), [[Code division multiple access]] (CDMA) or [[spread spectrum]] is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same [[frequency spectrum]], and this spectral bandwidth is much higher than the bit rate or [[symbol rate]]. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the [[spreading factor]]. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in [[statistical multiplexing]]), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]], and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by [[rake receiver]]s.

A significant application of CDMA is the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).

==Multiple access method==
A multiplexing technique may be further extended into a [[multiple access method]] or [[channel access method]], for example, TDM into [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) and statistical multiplexing into [[carrier-sense multiple access]] (CSMA). A multiple access method makes it possible for several transmitters connected to the same physical medium to share its capacity.

Multiplexing is provided by the [[Physical layer|Physical Layer]] of the [[OSI model]], while multiple access also involves a [[media access control]] protocol, which is part of the [[data link layer|Data Link Layer]].

The Transport layer in the OSI model, as well as TCP/IP model, provides statistical multiplexing of several application layer data flows to/from the same computer.

[[Code-division multiplexing]] (CDM) is a technique in which each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber and asynchronously demultiplexed. Other widely used multiple access techniques are [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) and [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA).
Code-division multiplex techniques are used as an access technology, namely code-division multiple access (CDMA), in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) standard for the third-generation (3G) mobile communication identified by the ITU.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Application areas==

===Telegraphy===
The earliest communication technology using electrical wires, and therefore sharing an interest in the economies afforded by multiplexing, was the [[electric telegraph]]. Early experiments allowed two separate messages to travel in opposite directions simultaneously, first using an electric battery at both ends, then at only one end.

* [[Émile Baudot]] developed a [[time-multiplexing]] system of multiple [[David E. Hughes|Hughes]] machines in the 1870s.
* In 1874, the [[quadruplex telegraph]] developed by [[Thomas Edison]] transmitted two messages in each direction simultaneously, for a total of four messages transiting the same wire at the same time.
* Several workers were investigating [[acoustic telegraphy]], a [[frequency-division multiplexing]] technique, which led to the [[invention of the telephone]].

===Telephony===
In [[telephony]], a [[customer]]'s [[local loop|telephone line]] now typically ends at the [[remote concentrator]] box, where it is multiplexed along with other [[telephone line]]s for that [[neighborhood]] or other similar area. The multiplexed signal is then carried to the [[telephone exchange|central switching office]] on significantly fewer wires and for much further distances than a customer's line can practically go.  This is likewise also true for [[digital subscriber line]]s (DSL).

[[Fiber in the loop]] (FITL) is a common method of multiplexing, which uses [[optical fiber]] as the [[Backbone network|backbone]].  It not only connects [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone lines with the rest of the [[PSTN]], but also replaces DSL by connecting directly to [[Ethernet]] wired into the [[home]].  [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] is often the [[communications protocol]] used.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[Cable TV]] has long carried multiplexed [[television channel]]s, and late in the 20th century began offering the same services as [[telephone companies]].  [[IPTV]] also depends on multiplexing.

===Video processing===
{{Main|Demultiplexer (media file)}}
In [[video]] editing and processing systems, multiplexing refers to the process of interleaving audio and video into one coherent data stream.

In [[digital video]], such a transport stream is normally a feature of a [[container format (digital)|container format]] which may include [[metadata]] and other information, such as [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. The audio and video streams may have variable bit rate. Software that produces such a transport stream and/or container is commonly called a [[statistical multiplexer]] or '''muxer'''. A '''demuxer''' is software that extracts or otherwise makes available for separate processing the components of such a stream or container.

===Digital broadcasting===
In [[digital television]] systems, several variable bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream by means of [[statistical multiplexing]]. This makes it possible to transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. This may involve several [[standard definition television]] (SDTV) programmes (particularly on [[DVB-T]], [[DVB-S2]], [[ISDB]] and ATSC-C), or one [[HDTV]], possibly with a single SDTV companion channel over one 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide TV channel. The device that accomplishes this is called a [[statistical multiplexer]]. In several of these systems, the multiplexing results in an [[MPEG transport stream]]. The newer DVB standards DVB-S2 and [[DVB-T2]] has the capacity to carry several [[HDTV]] channels in one multiplex.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In [[digital radio]], a multiplex (also known as an ensemble) is a number of radio stations that are grouped together. A multiplex is a stream of digital information that includes audio and other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioandtvhelp.co.uk/interference/rtis_radio/DABmuxes_DABradio|title=All about DAB multiplexes|work=Radio &amp; Television Investigation Service|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[communications satellite]]s which carry [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[television network]]s and [[radio network]]s, this is known as '''multiple channel per carrier''' or '''MCPC'''. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single [[transponder]]), [[single channel per carrier]] mode is used.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Analog broadcasting===
In [[FM broadcasting]] and other [[analog signal|analog]] [[radio]] media, multiplexing is a term commonly given to the process of adding [[subcarrier]]s to the audio signal before it enters the [[transmitter]], where [[modulation]] occurs. (In fact, the stereo multiplex signal can be generated using time-division multiplexing, by switching between the two (left channel and right channel) input signals at an ultrasonic rate (the subcarrier), and then filtering out the higher harmonics.)  Multiplexing in this sense is sometimes known as '''MPX''', which in turn is also an old term for [[stereophonic]] FM, seen on [[stereo system]]s since the 1960s.

==Other meanings==
In [[spectroscopy]] the term is used to indicate that the experiment is performed with a mixture of frequencies at once and their respective response unravelled afterwards using the [[Fourier transform]] principle.

In [[computer programming]], it may refer to using a single in-memory resource (such as a file handle) to handle multiple external resources (such as on-disk files).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Multiplexing filehandles with select() in perl
| url = http://www.perlfect.com/articles/select.shtml}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electrical multiplexing techniques do not require a physical "[[multiplexer]]" device, they refer to a "[[keyboard matrix (music)|keyboard matrix]]" or "[[Charlieplexing]]" design style:
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a [[multiplexed display]] (non-multiplexed displays are immune to [[multiplexed display#"Break up"|break up]]).
* Multiplexing may refer to the design of a "switch matrix" (non-multiplexed buttons are immune to "phantom keys" and also immune to  [[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|"phantom key blocking"]]).

In high-throughput [[DNA sequencing]], the term is used to indicate that some artificial sequences (often called ''barcodes'' or ''indexes'') have been added to link given sequence reads to a given sample, and thus allow for the sequencing of multiple samples in the same reaction.

'''NFR ([[Non-functional requirement|Non-Functional Requirements]])''' is a framework on [[Goal Modelling]]. The analysis begins with softgoals that represent NFR which stakeholders agree upon. Softgoals are goals that are hard to express, but tend to be global qualities of a software system. These could be usability, performance, security and flexibility in a given system. These softgoals are then usually decomposed and refined to uncover a tree structure of goals and subgoals for e.g. the flexibility softgoal. Once uncovering tree structures, one is bound to find interfering softgoals in different trees, e.g. security goals generally interferes with usability. These softgoal trees now form a softgoal graph structure. The final step in this analysis is to pick some particular leaf softgoals, so that all the root softgoals are satisfied.

== Measuring the Non-functional requirements ==

SNAP is the Software Non-functional Assessment Process. While Function Points measure the functional requirements by sizing the data flow through a software application, IFPUG's SNAP measures the non-functional requirements.  

The SNAP model consists of four categories and fourteen sub-categories to measure the non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirement are mapped to the relevant sub-categories. Each sub-category is sized, and the size of a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub-categories.

The SNAP sizing process is very similar to the Function Point sizing process.  Within the application boundary, non-functional requirements are associated with relevant categories and their sub-categories. Using a standardized set of basic criteria, each of the sub-categories is then sized according to its type and complexity; the size of such a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub-categories.  These sizes are then totaled to give the measure of non-functional size of the software application.

Beta testing of the model shows that SNAP size has a strong correlation with the work effort required to develop the non-functional portion of the software application.

In [[computer networking]] and [[computer architecture]], a '''northbound interface''' of a component is an [[interface (computer science)|interface]] that conceptualizes the [[low level|lower level]] details (e.g., [[Data (computing)|data]] or [[Function (computer science)|functions]]) used by, or in, the component.  A northbound interface is used to interface with [[High and low level|higher level]] [[abstraction layer|layers]] using the '''southbound interface''' of the higher level component(s). In [[Computer architecture|architectural]] overviews, the northbound interface is normally drawn at the top of the component it is defined in, hence the name northbound interface.

A southbound interface decomposes concepts in the technical details, mostly specific to a single [[software component|component]] of the architecture.  Southbound interfaces are drawn at the bottom of an architectural overview.

Northbound interfaces normally talk to southbound interfaces of higher level components and vice versa.

==Typical use==

A northbound interface is typically an [[output (computing)|output]]-only interface (as opposed to one that accepts user input) found in [[Carrier Grade Open Framework|carrier-grade network]] and [[telecommunications network]] elements. The [[programming language|languages]] or [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] commonly used include [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] and [[Transaction Language 1|TL1]]. For example, a device that is capable of sending out [[syslog]] messages but that is not configurable by the user is said to implement a northbound interface. Other examples include [[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]], [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|IPMI]], [[WSMAN]], [[SOAP]], etc.

The game continues the story of [[Abe (Oddworld)|Abe]], charting his efforts to save his fellow Mudokons from another plot by the Glukkons to exploit them. Abe discovers that the Glukkons are enslaving Mudokons, this time to produce a drink called Soulstorm Brew, which uses Mudokon bones and tears as its ingredients. The player assumes the role of Abe, embarking on a quest to halt production of SoulStorm Brew.

The game was released to similar critical acclaim as the first title. Reviews praised the game's ability to allow the player to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; anywhere they liked, a feature that was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'', while noting that it was very similar to that title.&lt;ref name="Review1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Fielder|date=November 25, 1998|title=GameSpot review of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|publisher=GameSpot UK|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214100548/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|archivedate=February 14, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game won multiple awards upon release.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards List for Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|work=[[Oddworld Inhabitants]]|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006094518/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, it was announced that [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] are working on a follow-up to ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]'' (a 2014 ''Abe's Oddysee'' remake) titled ''[[Oddworld: Soulstorm]]''. The game page confirms that this title is inspired by ''Abe's Exoddus'' and that the new game is going to be a re-tale of ''Abe's Exoddus''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oddworld.com/soulstorm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Abe's Exoddus'' is a [[two-dimensional]] platform game, with many of its elements taken from the previous title, ''Abe's Oddysee''. The game is split into screens; when the player moves into the edge of the screen, the environment is replaced, just like in the previous title. Most screens include various puzzles that must be solved through the use of Abe's unique abilities: "GameSpeak", possession, controlling mine cars, activation or deactivation of mines or levers, and rocks, grenades, or bones that can be picked up and used for different purposes. Normal abilities include creeping, walking, running, rolling, hoisting, jumping, and crouching, all of which have specific application and make up a necessary arsenal of moves.

The game features no [[graphical user interface|user interface]] or [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]]. Information is conveyed to the player through instructive screens that can be activated by the player character, or through scrolling messages in the background. Characters do not have [[hit point]]s; instead, being attacked (such as being shot or mauled) generally causes instant death. However, the player has unlimited lives, and upon death will [[Spawn point|re-spawn]] at the last [[Save point|checkpoint]] they reached. ''Abe's Exoddus'' includes an option to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; which allows the player to designate their own checkpoints, a feature which was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'' due to programming conflicts and which attracted criticism of that title.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Craddock |date=December 29, 2008 |title=GOG.com Editorial of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |work=GOG.com |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122093946/http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the focus of the gameplay is surmounting screens, there is a secondary focus on rescuing enslaved Mudokons. GameSpeak is a pivotal ability in this respect; by pressing combinations of buttons, the player character will utter short phrases that can be used to control allied [[non-player character]]s—to pull extra levers, to follow the player character,or simply to wait.

[[Image:AbesExoddusScreen1.jpg|thumb|left|Abe and some Mudokons sneak past a sleeping Slig.]]

Unlike the first game, Mudokons have emotional states and status ailments that affect how they respond to Abe. Mudokons may be angry, wired, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], sick, or blind, and each state must be dealt with differently by the player. Angry, wired or depressed characters can be consoled through specific GameSpeak commands. An "angry" Mudokon (red) will either repeatedly slap nearby Mudokons or work dangerous traps and can be told to "stop it" though Abe must tell them he is "sorry" to calm them down. If a "depressed" Mudokon (blue) witnesses too many deaths of other Mudokons or if he is slapped, he will start to hit himself in the head and eventually commit suicide. Abe again can prevent this by saying "stop it" and remove the ailment by telling them he's "sorry". Both angry and depressed Mudokons will not follow Abe if he tells them to. Clouds of laughing gas will turn Mudokons "wired" (lime), causing them to hyperactively run in Abe's direction and in some cases make it harder to get past enemies and obstacles. They will only calm down when slapped but the slap will have no effect if done within the gas cloud. "Sick" Mudokons will not respond to any GameSpeak command whatsoever (aside from being slapped) and can only be cured with a special chant, obtained when Abe finds a helper character. Blind Mudokons (distinguished by pale skin and with their eyes sewn shut) will keep walking in the direction of Abe's voice, and must be told to "wait" before they walk into a hazard.

[[Spiritual possession|Possession]] is the player character's ability to take control of certain characters in the same screen by chanting. When a character is possessed, the player can use their abilities and weapons to find otherwise unreachable areas or levers, kill enemies, or as part of solving puzzles. However, when possessing a character, the player character remains immobile and vulnerable to attack. Possessing a slig in particular sometimes has to use voice commands to solve puzzles. This is done with an "Ackack!" which the game refers to as 'BS' "Ay!" which is referred to in the game as 'S'BS' and a laugh. The whistling passwords have been removed from the previous game.

The player can abandon possession of a creature at any time. Scrabs or Paramites will be released without harm when abandoned, while Industrialists (Sligs and Glukkons) will burst into pieces. If the player character has drunk Soulstorm Brew, they will be able to possess their own [[flatulence|fart]], which can then be used as a flying explosive and will detonate either when control is abandoned, or after a period of time.

Slave Mudokons (including blind ones) are rescued through Bird Portals. If the player character chants when in the same screen as a Bird Portal, the portal will activate, and any nearby Mudokon slaves will run through it, disappearing. Rescuing Mudokons is not usually crucial to progressing through the game; however, rescuing at least 150 is necessary to get the good ending, and many secret areas revolve around rescuing a few Mudokons in particularly complex situations. There is an alternative ending known as the 'Maximum Casualties' ending. If the player kills all 278 Mudokons, the player is awarded with invincibility.

The player can also gain the ability to turn into the Shrykull, a Mudokon supernatural demigod. Abe acquired this power at a late stage in ''Abe's Oddysee''. The ability is earned by sending a certain number of Mudokons through a bird portal at once, denoted by a number circulating with the birds. With the ability, the player can enter a screen with enemies or explosives, chant to transform into the Shrykull, and vaporize all enemies and hazards on the screen. Afterward, the player character turns back into Mudokon form. Achieving the ability and doing such is necessary to get past certain points in the game. The player can only turn into the Shrykull once each time they earn the ability, so where and when they choose to use it is important.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

===Allies, enemies and wildlife===
Allies in the game include Mudokons, humanoid species encountered as rescuable slaves and helpers. Normally, they will follow any GameSpeak-given order, but as described above, some Mudokons will be emotional and must be consoled by the player character first. The player character can also possess other creatures, in order to gain help with a task. For example, when possessing a [[Paramite]], the player character can use GameSpeak to communicate with other Paramites, in much the same way as Mudokons. Scrabs also have minor abilities of GameSpeak, but are limited to shrilling, which activates the ability to attack.

Enemies in the game primarily consist of Sligs, semi-robotic creatures who will attempt to kill the player character on sight. Although most have mechanical legs and carry [[machine gun]]s, some Sligs wear helicopter flight packs and launch [[grenade]]s. Some Sligs choose to sleep without wearing mechanical legs, in which case they are vulnerable until they can obtain a set. Sligs can be possessed by the player character, who can then control the Slig and utilize its weapon. Sligs cannot see in dark shadows, which create natural hiding places for the player character. Sligs are often accompanied by Slogs, bipedal dog-like creatures that chase and attack the player character on sight. Slogs can be commanded if the player possesses a Slig, and can be ordered to attack and kill enemies. Sloggies are the puppy form of Slogs, and are slower but just as deadly if the player character encounters them. Slogs and Sloggies can be distracted with bones.

Other enemies include Greeters, robotic security guards originally designed for public speaking and advertising, until they began to attack their customers. Greeters have [[motion sensor|motion detectors]], and if the player character or another Mudokon triggers a Greeter's detector, the Greeter will give chase and attempt to kill the victim with an electric charge.

Glukkons feature as the game's primary antagonists. Glukkons are tall-foreheaded, humanoid creatures who are ruthless, malevolent businessmen. They walk on their arms as their feet are located upon their chest, and as a result they are physically defenseless and rely on Sligs to protect and serve them. They are the owners and bosses of the industries Abe visits throughout the game, and the masters of the Mudokon and Slig slaves. Glukkons can be possessed by the player, and can be made to command Sligs through GameSpeak, either to kill other characters, or to pull levers and move platforms.

Animals and wildlife consist of the [[Scrab]]s and aforementioned Paramites, both [[carnivore|carnivorous]] predators that are encountered in the burial vaults of Necrum. Scrabs are highly territorial and chase any other life form on sight. Should they encounter another Scrab, a short fight ensues in which one is killed. Paramites are [[pack hunter]]s, and when the player encounters a single Paramite, the Paramite will flee and not attack the player unless they are cornered. When encountered in groups of two or more, Paramites will pursue and attack the player. Paramites can be distracted with chunks of meat.

Other wildlife include the Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld. When woken from sleep, they will chase the player character and any other Mudokons, attacking with their long tongues before swallowing the victim whole. Fleeches fear Scrabs and Paramites and try to avoid them whenever possible. Fleeches are the only enemy that cannot kill Abe in one hit and it is possible to run away from Fleeches while they are attacking before they hit Abe enough to kill him, They are also the only enemies that can navigate up platform edges. Slurgs, the lowest form of life on Oddworld, are often found alongside Fleeches, as when stepped on by the player character, Slurgs emit a noise that wakes Fleeches from sleep. They can also be eaten by possessed Paramites without disturbing any nearby sleeping Fleeches

==Story==
[[Image:Oddworld Mudokons.jpg|thumb|Abe's friends retaliating against him, before they get sick.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"His scarred hand branded on moon's odd face, this hero may free the Mudokon race. With skin of blue and spirit guides too, only he can save our bones from brew. But shall he fall to Glukkon yoke, Mudokon nation... BE DOOMED TO CROAK."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The events of ''Abe's Exoddus'' follow on immediately from [[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee#Story|the events of ''Abe's Oddysee'']], beginning with the protagonist standing in front of a cheering crowd having saved 99 of his brethren from RuptureFarms. Abe falls from the stage, and loses consciousness; whereupon three Mudokon spirits known as the Weirdos inform Abe that the Glukkons are using Mudokon slaves to [[exhumation|exhume]] Mudokon bones at Necrum, the burial grounds of the ancient Mudokons.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|work=Oddworld Inhabitants|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216042559/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe and five friends (including an individual named Alf) cross the deserts of Oddworld, and infiltrate Necrum Mines, where Abe is separated from his friends.

Abe explores the mines and is reunited with his friends; but they drink an excess of an Industrial drink called Soulstorm Brew and become sick from doing so. Abe then discovers that Soulstorm Brew contains Mudokon bones. At this, Abe overloads the boilers that power Necrum Mines, only just escaping the resulting explosion. Thereafter Abe navigates the jungles and Mudokon [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s of Necrum, liberating trapped Mudokon spirits, until he finds the three Weirdos who told him about Necrum. They ask him to shut down Soulstorm Brewery, which is also exploiting Mudokon slaves, and brand a scar across his chest, which gives Abe the power to heal Mudokons sick from Brew. Having restored his friends, Abe proceeds to the FeeCo Depot, a large railway station and [[transshipment]]/storage area, where he learns that the entrance to Soulstorm Brewery has been sealed by three high-ranking Glukkons. To unseal the entrance, Abe infiltrates a bone processing plant named Bonewerkz, the Slig [[Barracks]], and the FeeCo Executive Office. By possessing all three Glukkon owners in turn, Abe orders the Slig guards to open the main gate of Soulstorm Brewery, and uses a train from the FeeCo Depot to get there. As Abe explores Soulstorm Brewery, he learns that the second ingredient of Soulstorm Brew is Mudokon tears, and that the Glukkons obtain the tears by attaching Mudokon slaves to machines that electrocute them repeatedly. Abe also discovers that he can destroy the brewery by overloading its main boiler and causing an explosion. What happens next depends on how many Mudokons Abe has saved throughout the game.

[[Image:SoulStorm Destruction.jpg|thumb|The destruction of Soulstorm Brewery.]]
*If 150 or more Mudokons are rescued, Abe succeeds in destroying Soulstorm Brewery, and escapes to be greeted by the Mudokons he saved, who then use their skills to build a [[Alcoholics Anonymous|rehabilitation center for Brew addicts]] named "Alf's Rehab &amp; Tea". Abe is called a "terrorist mastermind" by the Magog Cartel, and a hero by his fellow Mudokons who resolve to find and free other enslaved Mudokons (this ending is cut short by a "newscaster" Slig who reports in on the rumor of Abe's destruction of Soulstorm Brewery, reminding the viewers to "stay tuned for more on this story as it develops").&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Good Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Should the player save less than 150 Mudokons, they will instead receive the Bad Ending. Abe is ganged up on by his friends for not helping the slaves, and he is knocked unconscious. He is attached to a machine used by the brewery for extracting tears, and is killed by an overload of electricity from the machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Bad Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the endings, if the player saves all 300 Mudokons, they are rewarded with a screen that says "Coming in 2000, ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''". This screen is followed by another that gives supposed hints to the upcoming release including Abe's long lost mother. This information, however, is presumed to be a part of the original story that was cut since there is no mention of Abe's mother in ''[[Munch's Oddysee]]'' at all. Finally an art gallery showing concept and production art for ''Abe's Exoddus'' will begin playing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

If the player kills every Mudokon, except those that cannot be reached or must be rescued to proceed through the game, they will be returned to the FeeCo Depot with permanent invincibility. This was prevented by a bug in the PC version of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Following the overwhelming success of ''Abe's Oddysee'', [[GT Interactive]], the publishers of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'', pushed for a sequel to be made by [[Christmas]] 1998. In order to meet this deadline, ''Abe's Exoddus'' was made to run on the same game engine as ''Abe's Oddysee'', and was completed in nine months. [[Lorne Lanning]], the [[game director|director]] of both games, stated that "we killed ourselves getting ''Abe's Exoddus'' done in nine months. It was brutal."&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

The [[Game Boy Color]] port was released as '''''Oddworld Adventures 2'''''; it was developed by [[Saffire Corporation]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in November [[1999 in video gaming|1999]]. The game is a significantly cut-down version of ''Abe's Exoddus'', with only a few similar levels and an absence of plot.&lt;ref name="boy1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason White|title=Oddworld Adventures 2|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=1:20934|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abe's Exoddus'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2017-11-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117090314/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/oddworld-abes-exoddus |archivedate=2017-01-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised Abe's range of abilities because they can be used in "lateral [and] unrelated" ways, but criticized the general gameplay for being similar to its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Edge review"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Abe's Exoddus |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=65 |page=93 |date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Contrast, [[GameSpot]] stated, "though the ''Exoddus'' gameplay is essentially more of the same, it's more of a good thing".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-abes-exoddus-review/1900-2545915/ |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review |author=Lauren Fielder |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=1998-11-25 |accessdate=2017-11-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022073529/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-abes-exoddus-review/1900-2545915/ |archivedate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Zone]]'' praised the game's cut-scenes, stating that "the cut-scenes are brilliantly created (especially in the sound department)".&lt;ref name="PCZone review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=2688 |title=Abe's |publisher=''[[PC Zone]]'' |date=2001-08-13 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209231657/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=2688 |archivedate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave particular praise to the game's graphics: "The 3D characters are better looking than the previous iteration, and more animated backgrounds and moving parts liven up the slightly old formula".&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/01/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |author=Doug Perry |date=1998-11-30 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130213737/http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/01/oddworld-abes-exoddus |archivedate=2017-01-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism varied between reviews. GameSpot's sole criticism was of the game's two-player mode, stating that "the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; ''PC Zone'' focused on the game's difficulty, stating that "it's too f**king hard...You sometimes start to dread moving into a (obviously harder) new area of the game".&lt;ref name="PCZone review"/&gt; IGN criticised [[trial and error]] gameplay, stating that "the same trial-and-error scheme is frustrating as a thorn in your heel. Several areas simply leave you stranded, and you have to start over."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Despite these criticisms, the game won many awards, including the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] Showstopper award from GamePro in 1998, the E3 Best of Show Winners List, the Best Action/Adventure PSX Game award from Next Level Holiday Guide in 1999, and the 1998 Best PSX Adventure Game award from Game Revolution in 1999.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"/&gt; It was nominated for [[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]]'s 1999 "Best Arcade Game" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Rayman 2: The Great Escape]]''.&lt;ref name=gamecenter1999&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000606180348/http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | url=http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | title=The Gamecenter Awards for 1999! | author=The Gamecenter Staff | date=January 21, 2000 | archivedate=June 6, 2000 | work=[[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the computer version of ''Abe's Exoddus'' sold 9,499 copies during 1999.&lt;ref name=pcgsales3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|date=April 2000|volume=7|issue=4|title=''PC Gamer'' Editors' Choice Winners: Does Quality Matter?|journal=[[PC Gamer US]]|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to further market the game Developer Oddworld Inhabitants submitted a 15-minute short film of looped cinematics for the '[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]' category of the [[71st Academy Awards]]. The game's cinematics reportedly cost around $2 million to develop, about half of the game's total development budget.&lt;ref name="SPIN"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayeEJMF-CZUC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=david%20kushner&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20kushner&amp;f=false | title=Land of the Loops | author=Kushner, David | journal=SPIN | date=May  1999 | volume=15 | issue=5 | pages=73 | ISSN= 0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film failed to meet the shortlist CEO of Oddworld Sherry McKenna stated the pioneering move was done in order to increase the video game industry's reputation in the animation field:

==Remake==
On March 14, 2016 it was announced via a press-release that a new game titled ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is in development in conjunction with [[Frima Studio]], Sabotage and Fat Kraken Studios and is slated to be released later in 2017,&lt;ref name="soulstormannouncement"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamen |first1=Matt |title=Oddworld returns in 2017 with mysterious 'Soulstorm' |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/oddworld-soulstorm-gaming-classic-returns |date=March 14, 2016 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; later delayed to 2019. The game has been described by [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] as "a complete story retake [of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''] inspired by our original tale."&lt;ref name="First images"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/first-oddworld-soulstorm-image-surfaces-415232.phtml |title=First Oddworld: Soulstorm image surfaces |last=Devore |first=Jordan |work=[[Destructoid]] |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the announcement, it was announced in April 2015 that a remake of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was in the planning stages. Lanning said that ''Exoddus''{{'}}s success would contribute significantly to future ''Oddworld'' titles, and would be marketed more broadly than ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/14/oddworld-abes-exoddus-remake-in-the-works/|title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus remake in the works|author=Brenna Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'', Oddworld Inhabitants have started an [[alternate reality game]] in which they encourage fans to look for clues within files and websites they upload.&lt;ref name="First images" /&gt;

In September 2016 at the [[EGX (expo)|EGX Expo]], Oddworld Inhabitants game designer Matt Glanville said that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is going to be a bigger version of ''Abe's Exoddus''; featuring both areas and game mechanics from ''Exoddus'' as well as entirely new areas. The Quarma system from ''[[Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee]]'' will return and the path that the player takes will depend on the storyline. He also stated that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is a sequel to ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty'' and will be what ''Abe's Exoddus'' should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 23, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2AcGZd8P5Q |title=The Past and Future of Oddworld |publisher=EGX via YouTube |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' will have its first showcase at a Unity event in Berlin. It also states that attendees will give a closer look at Lorne Lanning's Studio.&lt;ref name="soulstormpremire"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Premires for Oddworld: Soulstorm, GTFO and More to be Showcased at Unite Berlin|url=https://wccftech.com/premiere-oddworld-soulstorm-unite-berlin/|website=wccftech|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19th 2018, a video was released during a conference which [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] uploaded to their YouTube channel titled Oddworld Video Showcase at Unite Berlin 2018. In this video, it shows [[Lorne Lanning]] in his studio working on some graphics design for the game using a digital pen and he says that Soulstorm is "soon to be released".&lt;ref name="soulstormunite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lanning |first1=Lorne |title=Oddworld Video Showcase Unite Berlin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9Zoyo8o8s |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then confirmed that Soulstorm will be released in 2019 - but platforms have not been announced.

In biology, a '''pedate''' structure is a structure that resembles feet, or has a quality of feet. It derives from the Latin verb "pedo", meaning "to furnish with feet".

==Plants==
[[File:Leaf morphology pedate.png|right|thumb|200px|A pedately divided leaf.]]
Botanically, the term is used to describe compound leaves, veins, or other structures, where the divisions of that structure arise from a central point (as in a [[palmate]] structure), but the lateral divisions are further cleft in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Plant Identification Terminology | first1=James G. | last1=Harris | first2=Melinda Woolf | last2=Harris | edition=2nd | publisher=Spring Lake Publishing | location=Spring Lake, Utah | year=1994 | isbn=0-9640221-6-8 | page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it can be used to describe a compound leaf with a terminal leaflet and branching axes to either side which curve outward and backward, to which leaflets are attached on the outer side of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Stuart Max | last=Walters | title=The European garden flora | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2000 | page=674 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1KmYnof5JYQC&amp;pg=PA674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
In animals, the term "pedate" is used to mean "having feet," a sense that includes the [[tube feet]] of echinoderms as well as the [[vertebrate]] [[foot]].

A '''private defense agency''' ('''PDA''') is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and [[military|military defense]] services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in [[anarcho-capitalism]] and market-based forms of [[social anarchism]], such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A PDA is distinguished from a [[Private military company|private contractor]] of the state which is [[Subsidy|subsidized]] financially through [[taxation]] or legally through [[monopoly]] and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]], and relies on [[conscription]] and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing [[insurance]] and [[security]] companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.

==Theory==
As proponents of [[free-market anarchism]],
[[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin,''The Relation of the State to the Individual'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Benjamin |title=Liberty and Taxation |journal=[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustave de Molinari]] first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.
The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The [[Mises Institute]] published a book of essays entitled ''[[The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Mises Review (Vol. 10, No. 1; Spring 2004) A summary is given in a review by David Gordon [https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=247&amp;sortorder=issue].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray N. Rothbard]] in ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'' and [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a [[privatization|privatized]] system of [[law]], [[police]], [[court]]s, [[insurance companies]] and [[arbitration]] agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, [[victimless crime]]s and "crimes against the state" would be rendered [[Mootness|moot]], and the legal realm would be limited to [[contract]]ual disputes and [[tort]] damages, as from [[assault]], [[burglary]], [[pollution]], and all other forms of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard133.html |title=Society without a State |journal=[[The Libertarian Forum]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Friedman, [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html Police, Courts, and Laws---on the Market], [http://daviddfriedman.com David Friedman home page].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is similar to [[Polycentric law]]. Within [[economics]], discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the [[Austrian School]], as in [[Hans Hoppe]]'s article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the [[Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Hoppe |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |format=[[PDF]] | title=The Private Production of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing [[Statism|statist]] defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of [[Sovereign state|states]]. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and [[Militarism|militarization]] in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and [[decentralization]] of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.

As a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. [[John Frederic Kosanke]] argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of [[proprietor]]s makes [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, [[vulnerability]] to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or [[Ideology|ideological]] justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederic Kosanke, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/johnfkosanke/Civilization101.html%23biv&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:56:26 "Civilization 101 - Elements of Security"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of monopoly power===
Hoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any [[monopoly]] is "bad" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|chapter=Introduction|pages=3–4|author=Hoppe, Hans-Hermann|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/web/2716 The Production of Security&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of the consumer, it is in the consumer's best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and of trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.}}
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the [[cartel]]'s market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency [[arbitration agreement]]s, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rejoinder to David Friedman on the Economics of Anarchy|author=Cowen, Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalist]]s argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.

===Aggression and abuses by private defense agencies===
[[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that "Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive." Holcombe states that [[mafia]]s offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] and [[Edward Stringham]] rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Government Inevitable? Comment on Holcombe's Analysis|author1=Leeson, Peter  |author2=Stringham, Edward P  |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=1674461 |journal=[[Independent Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by [[sovereign immunity]]. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=109–111|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it "couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=115|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, ''legalized'' channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument ''de novo'' is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State with Power and Market|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1054|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued, "If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse."&lt;ref name=Villacampa&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In a State of Anarchy|author=Villacampa, Alexander|publisher=Grove City College|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/story/1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, ''The Price of Private Law'', which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Price of Private Law|author=Bond, Jonathan C.|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating "There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders."&lt;ref name=Villacampa/&gt;

===Financing of private defense agencies===
Defense is often viewed as an archetypical [[public good]]{{spaced ndash}}i.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its [[non-excludability]] and [[non-rivalrous consumption]]. Specifically, the [[free rider problem]], in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1037|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the [[American Revolution]] occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent "[[enlightened self interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|pages=237–238|chapter=Mercenaries, Militias, Guerrillas, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies|author=Stromberg, Joseph R.|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Foreign Aggression|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=131|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of [[subrogation]], and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-treason.com/archives/2001/06/ No Treason » 2001 » June&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable [[collection cost]]s), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as [[privateer]]s did in the 18th and 19th centuries under [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Sechrest, Larry J. |authorlink=Larry J. Sechrest |chapter=Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=258|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war also used to have [[shadow price]]s (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Radnitzky, Gerard|chapter=Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=147|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no [[demonstrated preference]] has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Block, Walter|chapter=National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=310|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of widespread use==

===Ancient Europe===
Ancient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgy]]{{spaced ndash}}contributions made by rich citizens for specific purposes{{spaced ndash}}for defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus]] used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] used their own resources to suppress the armies of [[Spartacus]] in the [[Third Servile War]]. [[Julius Caesar]] made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by [[Gallic Wars|conquering]] [[Gaul]]. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the State|author=van Creveld, Martin|pages=32–33, 207|isbn=0-521-65629-X|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Iceland===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], "[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

===Post-Feudal Sicily===
The Mafia began in the 19th century.  Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name=Gambetta1993p94&gt;{{harvp|Gambetta|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">The '''Platinum-Cobalt Scale''' ('''Pt/Co scale''' or '''Apha-Hazen Scale''' ) is a color scale that was introduced in 1892 by chemist [[Allen Hazen]] (1869–1930). The index was developed as a way to evaluate [[pollution]] levels in waste water. It has since expanded to a common method of comparison of the intensity of yellow-tinted samples. It is specific to the color yellow and is based on dilutions of a 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] platinum cobalt solution. The [[ASTM]] has detailed description and procedures in ASTM Designation D1209, "Standard Test Method for Color of Clear Liquids (Platinum-Cobalt Scale)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an11_96br3.pdf|title=FAQ - How to Measure Color of a Sample &amp; Use An Index - HunterLab|first=|last=HunterLab|website=www.hunterlab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Designation D1209-00, "Standard Test Method for Color of Clear Liquids (Platinum-Cobalt Scale)," [[ASTM International]], [[West Conshohocken]], PA, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, A., "The Measurement of the Colors of Natural Waters," ''American Chemist Journal'' (18:264), 1896&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robby Cantarutti''' (born 17 June 1966) is an Italian [[architect]] and [[industrial designer]] from [[Venice]] and the best known practitioner of Italian [[Rationalism]].     
Cantarutti's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]], including his Cabin at the River, where he lives with his family.[[File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|thumb|[[c:File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricich]]|left]][[File:Chairs-table by Robby Cantarutti.jpg|thumb|chairs and table by Robby Cantarutti|left]]Cantarutti's work was influenced by his passions in life: [[architecture]] and nature. Cantarutti considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his [[architecture]] such crafts as wood, clear glass and raw [[ironwork]]. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as natural aging by [[atmospheric]] conditions.

==Style==
Under the influence of [[Bauhaus]] and [[Le Corbusier]], Cantarutti transcended mainstream [[Rationalism]], culminating in an organic style inspired by natural materials. Cantarutti's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by [[architects]]. His masterpiece, the Cabin at the River was also substance of the film “[https://pro-labs.imdb.com/title/tt6676214?d=inprod Cabin at the River]” directed  by [https://pro-labs.imdb.com/name/nm0890298/?ref_=sch_int Silvia Zeitlinger] and was awarded with the [http://www.arena-international.com/leafawards/winners-2016/2015-winners/ Green LEAF Award 2015] for Best Single House [[Architecture]] 2015. It is the most-photographed and filmed private [[building]] in [[Italy]]. Leading [[Lifestyle (sociology)|life style]] companies  like [[Illy]], [https://www.knoll.com Knoll] use the Cabin as a [[filming location]] for their promotion work.

==Furniture==
Cantarutti´s [[Industrial design|Industrial Design]] is distributed by the companies [http://www.vibia.com/en/ Vibia] and [http://www.fastspa.com/uk/azienda.asp Fast] all over the world.

In [[mycology]], a '''sanctioned name''' is a [[scientific name|name]] that was adopted (but not necessarily coined) in certain works of [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] or [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which are considered major points in [[fungal]] taxonomy.

==Definition and effects==
Sanctioned names are those, regardless of their authorship, that were used by Persoon in his ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]'' (1801) for [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], [[smut (fungus)|smuts]] and [[gasteromycetes]], and in Fries's ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'' (three volumes, published 1821–32) and ''[[Elenchus fungorum]]'' for all other fungi.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;

A sanctioned name, as defined under article 15 of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (previously, the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'') is automatically treated as if conserved against all earlier [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s or [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can still, however, be [[Conserved name|conserved or rejected]] normally.

==History==
Because of the imprecision associated with assigning starting dates for fungi sanctioned in Fries' three ''Systema'' volumes, the [[Stockholm]] 1950 [[International Botanical Congress]] defined arbitrary or actual publication dates for the starting points to improve the stability of nomenclature. These dates were 1 May 1753 for ''Species Plantarum'' (vascular plants), 31 December 1801 for ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum'', 31 December 1820 for ''Flora der Vorweldt'' (fossil plants), and 1 Jan 1821 for the first volume of ''Systema''. Because fungi defined in the second and third volumes lacked a starting-point book for reference, the Congress declared that these species, in addition to species defined in Fries' 1828 ''Elenchus Fungorum'' (a two-volume supplement to his ''System''), had "privileged status". According to Korf,&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt; the term "sanctioned" was first used to indicate these privileged names by the Dutch mycologist [[Marinus Anton Donk]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Donk1961/&gt;

In 1982, changes in the ''International Code for Botanical Nomenclature'' (the Sydney Code) restored Linnaeus' 1753 ''Species Plantarum'' as the starting point for fungal nomenclature; however, protected status was given to all names adopted by Persoon in his 1801 ''Synopsis'', and by Fries in both the ''Systema'' and the ''Elenchus''.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Demoulin1981/&gt; Soon after, in 1983, [[Richard P. Korf]] proposed the now widely accepted "colon-author indication", whereby sanctioned names are indicated by including ": Pers." or ": Fr." when fully citing the species author.&lt;ref name=Kuyper1998/&gt;

'''Send tracks''' (sometimes simply called '''Sends''') are the software audio [[routing]] equivalent to the [[aux-send]]s found on [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] sound mixing/sequencing consoles.

In audio recording, a given song is almost always made up of multiple tracks, with each instrument or sound on their own track (for example, one track could contain the drums, one the guitar, one for a vocal, etc).  Further, each track can be separately adjusted in many ways, such as changing the volume, adding effects, and so on.  This can be done with individual hardware components, commonly known as "outside the box," or via software applications known as [[Digital audio workstation|DAWs]] (Digital Audio Workstations), commonly known as "inside the box."

Send tracks are tracks that aren't (normally) used to record sound on themselves, but to apply those adjustments to multiple, perhaps even all, tracks the same way.  For example: if the drums are not on one track, but are instead spread out across multiple tracks (which is common), there is often the desire to treat them all the same in terms of volume, effects, etc.  Instead of doing that for each track, you can set up a single send track to apply to all of them.

==Advantages==
Because one can treat numerous tracks uniformly with a single send track, they can save a lot of time and resources.  They are also inherently more flexible than their hardware equivalent, since any number of send tracks can be created as needed. For more complicated effect chains, send tracks also allow their output to be routed to other send tracks, which can switch their routing to other send tracks in turn.  The solutions offered by most multi-track software provide musicians with an easier (although arguably less hands-on) approach to controlling sends and their respective effects on the audio.

'''Shakespeare's editors''' were essential in the development of the modern practice of producing printed books and the evolution of [[textual criticism]].

The 17th-century [[Folio (printing)|folio]] collections of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] did not have editors in the modern sense of the term. In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the [[First Folio]] ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) were gathered together or "compiled" by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play manuscripts may have been [[proofreading|proofread]] and prepared for printing by [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of [[First Folio#First Folio Technique|proofreading and correcting]] the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the [[First Folio#Compositors|compositors]] and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.

Even less is known about the creation of the [[Second Folio|Second]] ([[1632 in literature|1632]]), Third ([[1663 in literature|1663&amp;ndash;64]]), and Fourth Folios ([[1685 in literature|1685]]) than about the First; see [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].

In the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.

*[[1709 in literature|1709]], [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]; [[book size|octavo]], 6 volumes. Rowe was the first person to attempt a clean and fully comprehensible text of the plays; but he depended upon a copy of the Fourth Folio and made generally [[conjectural emendation]]s. He also added full stage directions (he was a playwright himself) and full lists of ''Dramatis personae'', and wrote the first biographical sketch of the poet. 
*[[1725 in literature|1725]], [[Alexander Pope]]; [[book size|quarto]], 6 volumes. Pope was the first to attempt a collation of the quarto texts of the plays, yet he produced what was basically a reprint of Rowe that added little of value.
*[[1733 in literature|1733]], [[Lewis Theobald]]; octavo, 7 volumes. Theobald has been called "the first Shakespeare scholar";&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; he carried forward the task of collating the quartos, and began the study of Shakespeare's sources and the order of the plays' composition. (See [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|Chronology of Shakespeare's plays]].)
*[[1744 in literature|1744]], [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Thomas Hanmer]]; quarto, 6 volumes. Hanmer relied on Theobald's text, and made guesswork corrections. His edition was reprinted in [[1770 in literature|1770]].
*[[1747 in literature|1747]], [[William Warburton]]; octavo, 8 volumes. Warburton built upon Pope's edition; indeed, Warburton placed Pope's name before his own on the title pages of his edition. In his preface, Warburton wrote that his friend Pope "was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet, as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that ''his'' Edition should be melted down into ''mine'', as it would, he said, afford him (so great is the modesty of an ingenuous temper) a fit opportunity of confessing his Mistakes." The phrase "without Talents or Judgment" refers to Theobold and Hanmer. However, Warburton did allow, rather begrudgingly, some corrections put forward by Theobold and Hanmer: "For the rest, all the Corrections which these two Editors have made on any ''reasonable'' Foundation, are here admitted into the Text; and carefully assigned to their respective Authors. A piece of Justice which the ''Oxford Editor'' never did; and which the ''Other'' was not always scrupulous in observing towards me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warburton|first1=William|title=The Works of Shakespear|date=1747|publisher=J. &amp; P. Knapton; S. Birt; T. Longman &amp; T. Shewell; and others|location=London|pages=title page, xix, &amp; xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[1748 in literature|1748]] Thomas Edwards published his ''Supplement to Warburton's Edition of Shakespeare'', in later editions called ''The Canons of Criticism'' &amp;mdash; a satirical but spot-on analysis of Warburton's editorial emendations, some of which are truly silly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Thomas|title=The Canons of Criticism, and Glossary|date=1765|publisher=C. Bathurst|location=London|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson had this to say: "Soon after Edwards's ''Canons of Criticism'' came out, Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller's, with Hayman the Painter and some more company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to put that authour upon a level with Warburton, "Nay, (said Johnson,) he has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other is a horse still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=James|editor1-last=Malone|editor1-first=Edmond|title=The Life of Samuel Johnson|date=1807|publisher=T. Cadell &amp; W. Davies|location=London|page=207, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1765 in literature|1765]], [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''; octavo, 8 volumes. Johnson in turn relied upon Warburton; his edition is noteworthy mainly for its famous Preface.
*[[1768 in literature|1768]], [[Edward Capell]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Appalled by the undisciplined emendations of Hanmer and Warburton, Capell spent three decades collecting and collating the quartos. He was also the first to exploit the [[Stationers' Register]] and [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'', and to explore Shakespeare's use of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and Sir [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]].''
*[[1773 in literature|1773]], [[George Steevens]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Steevens employed Johnson's text, but continued Capell's trend of adding new material. Steevens revised and re-issued his edition in [[1778 in literature|1778]]; in [[1780 in literature|1780]] Edmond Malone added another 2 volumes that contained Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems and other material. [[Isaac Reed]] revised the Steevens edition again in 1785, and Steevens himself produced one final, 15-volume revision in [[1793 in literature|1793]].
*[[1790 in literature|1790]], [[Edmond Malone]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Malone, often considered the best of the century's editors of Shakespeare, wrote the first general consideration of [[English Renaissance theatre]], utilizing resources like the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] and [[Edward Alleyn]]'s papers at [[Dulwich College]].  He is also noted for his work on the problem of chronology.

The early 19th century saw the first [[Variorum]] editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:

*[[1803 in literature|1803]], the First Variorum edition, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]; 21 volumes.
*[[1813 in literature|1813]], the Second Variorum, a reprint of the First; 21 volumes.
*[[1821 in literature|1821]], the Third Variorum, edited by James Boswell;&lt;ref&gt;Not the famous [[James Boswell|Boswell]], the biographer of Johnson, but rather his third son (1778&amp;ndash;1822): Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells: ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare.'' OUP 2001. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 volumes.

These massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general. In the 19th century the text, drawn primarily from Malone and Steevens, was "monumentalized"{{sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}} in the Cambridge edition (1863-6) and its single-volume companion, the Globe edition (1864). It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.{{Sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}}

As for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of ''[[The Dunciad]].'' Warburton belittled Rowe's "Account of the Life" of Shakespeare &amp;mdash; but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 30, 110, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863&amp;ndash;66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by [[William George Clark]] and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and [[William Aldis Wright]]. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.

The most radical edition in the twentieth century was the [[Oxford Shakespeare]], prepared under the general editorship of [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Gary Taylor (English literature scholar)|Gary Taylor]]. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of ''[[King Lear]]'', a text of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.

{{Disability}}
The '''Society for Disability Studies''' is an international academic network of [[disability studies]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/about |title=About SDS - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often abbreviates its name to '''SDS''', though that abbreviation continues to be used by academics and [[political scientists]] to describe the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] organization in the [[United States]]. The society's overall goal is to promote disability studies as a serious [[academic discipline]] on par with [[philosophy]], the [[social sciences]], and similar fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html |first=Cecilia Capuzzi |last=Simon |title=Disability Studies: A New Normal |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2013-11-03 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of disability studies==
In 1993 the society adopted an official definition of "Disability Studies":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... examines the policies and practices of all societies to understand the social, rather than the physical or psychological determinants of the experience of disability. Disability Studies has been developed to disentangle impairments from the myths, ideology and stigma that influence social interaction and social policy. The scholarship challenges the idea that the economic and social statuses and the assigned roles of people with disabilities are the inevitable outcomes of their condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crds.org/about/index.shtml|title=Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies - University of Calgary|publisher=crds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Founding and history ==
The organization was founded in 1982 first as the '''Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability''' (SSCIID), and renamed '''Society for Disability Studies''' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders are Daryl Evans, Nora Groce, Steve Hey, Gary Kiger, John Seidel, Jessica Scheer and Irving Kenneth Zola (1935-1994).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Disability Studies is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

The Society maintains affiliation status with the Western Social Science Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wssaweb.com&lt;/ref&gt; (WSSA) through its Chronic Disease and Disability section. Currently, the SDS has hundreds of members both nationally and internationally who continue to make disability studies a part of academic conversations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Activities and publications==
The Society for Disability Studies holds an annual conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/annual-conference |title=Annual Conference - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org |date=2008-06-21|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June and publishes a quarterly peer-reviewed journal, the ''Disability Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dsq-sds.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/ |title=Disability Studies Quarterly|publisher=dsq-sds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is published exclusively online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org|title=Disability Studies Quarterly - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDS has created a good model to follow when approaching publishers about their accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.disstudies.org/Publishing%20Accessible%20Books|title = Publishing Accessible Books|date = |access-date = 2016-02-16|website = Society for Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adam Newman organized the "Digital Access Facilitation Team" (DAFT)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success&lt;/ref&gt; to make the 2015 annual conference of the Society for Disability Studies more accessible for a wider range of attendees. DAFT is coordinated by the Society's Student Caucus, whose members are a group of 25-30 students of SDS. Working in teams of two, members of DAFT were live-tweeting every session, contingent upon the consent of presenters. Live-tweeting all sessions and following standards for that emerging media, allowed a new way of producing accessibility for the disability community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Access Facilitation Team - SDS 2015 {{!}} Adam Newman's Fundraiser|url = http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success|website = Crowdrise|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Society for Disability Studies, there are a number of caucuses which “designate groups that are under-represented within society or SDS as an organization.” DAFT is composed entirely of students (undergraduate, graduate, professional) who work on behalf of the interest and needs of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDS Student Caucus|url = http://sdsstudentcaucus.wordpress.com|website = SDS Student Caucus|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Membership ==
There are several options for membership opportunities, even if someone is unable to pay the membership fees they will not be turned away; "No one is denied membership in SDS due to an inability to pay an established membership fee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = join SDS {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/membership/join|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Two awards have been established by the society "to honor individuals who have shown dedication to Disability studies": the ''Senior Scholar Award'' and the ''Irving K. Zola Award for Emerging Scholars in Disability Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/awards|title=SDS Awards - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Senior Scholar Award'' is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of disability studies. Past award winners: Devva Kasnitz (2014), Richard Scotch (2013), Carol Gill (2012), Tobin Siebers (2011), Rosemarie Garland Thomson (2010), Elizabeth Depoy and Stephen Gilson (2009), and Steven J. Taylor (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/awards/sds-senior-scholar|title=SDS Senior Scholar - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the ''Irving K. Zola Award for Emerging Scholars in Disability Studies'' is awarded to an up and coming individual who also has made significant contributions to the field of disability studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23750">Various '''sociological classifications of religious movements''' have been proposed by scholars. In the [[sociology of religion]], the most widely used classification  is the church-sect [[wikt:typology|typology]]. The typology states that churches, ecclesia, denominations and sects form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are break-away groups from more mainstream religions and tend to be in tension with society.

Cults and [[new religious movement]]s fall outside this continuum and in contrast to aforementioned groups often have a novel teaching. They have been classified on their attitude towards society and the level of involvement of their adherents.

== Church-sect typology ==
[[File:Church-sect continuum.svg|right|thumb|400px|A diagram of the church-sect typology continuum. Include church, denomination, sect, cult, new religious movement, and institutionalized sect.]]
This church-sect typology has its origins in the work of [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Dawson2006p26"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise is that there is a continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of ''[[sects]]'' to the equilibrium maintaining ''churches''. Along this continuum are several additional types, each of which will be discussed in turn.

Many labels are commonly employed by non-sociologists to refer to religions and tend to be used interchangeably. Sociologists, when speaking technically, will not use these labels interchangeably as they are designations for religions with very specific characteristics.

These differing religions are often classified by sociologists as ''[[ideal type]]s''. Ideal types are ''pure'' examples of the categories. Because there is significant variation in each religion, how closely an individual religion actually holds as their ''ideal type'' categorisation will vary. Nevertheless, the categorisation scheme is useful as it also outlines a sort of developmental process for religions.

===Church and ecclesia===
Johnstone provides the following seven characteristics of churches:&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone. 1997. Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion. Upper Sadle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Claim universality, include all members of the society within their ranks, and have a strong tendency to equate "citizenship" with "membership"
* Exercise religious monopoly and try to eliminate religious competition
* Are very closely allied with the state and secular powers; frequently there is overlapping of responsibilities and much mutual reinforcement
* Are extensively organized as a hierarchical bureaucratic institution with a complex division of labor
* Employ professional, full-time clergy who possess the appropriate credentials of education and formal ordination
* Primarily gain new members through natural reproduction and the socialization of children into the ranks
* Allow for diversity by creating different groups within the church (e.g., orders of nuns or monks) rather than through the formation of new religions

The classical example of a ''church'' by this definition is the [[Catholic Church]], especially in the past, such as the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]. Today, the Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of [[religious pluralism]], or competition among religions. This is especially true of Catholicism in the United States. The change from a ''church'' to a ''denomination'' is still under way in many Latin American countries where the majority of citizens remain Catholics.

[[Islam]] is a church in countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iran, where there is no [[separation of church and state]]. The [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] states: "[The Constitution of Saudi Arabia is] [[Qur'an|God's Book]] [the Qur'an] and the [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad|His Prophet]] [Muhammad]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://saudinf.com/main/c541.htm The Basic Law - Saudi Arabia Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These nations are ruled under an official interpretation of [[religious law]] (''[[Salafi]]'' in the case of Saudi Arabia), and the religious law predominates the legal system. Saudi Arabia, however, lacks Johnstone's criteria for an ordained clergy and a strictly hierarchical structure, although it has the ''[[ulema]]''. In the [[Shi'a]] denominations, there is a professional clergy led by a [[Grand Ayatollah]].

A slight modification of the ''church'' type is that of ''ecclesia''.&lt;ref&gt;von Wiese 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesias include the above characteristics of churches with the exception that they are generally less successful at garnering absolute adherence among all of the members of the society and are not the sole religious body. The [[state church]]es of some European nations would fit this type.

===Denominations===
{{main|Religious denomination}}
The ''denomination'' lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. Denominations come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. A denomination is one religion among many. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics. Johnstone provides the following eight characteristics of denominations:
# similar to churches, but unlike sects, in being on relatively good terms with the state and secular powers and may even attempt to influence government at times
# maintain at least tolerant and usually fairly friendly relationships with other denominations in a context of [[religious pluralism]]
# rely primarily on birth for membership increase, though it will also accept converts; some actively pursue evangelization
# accept the principle of at least modestly changing doctrine and practice and tolerate some theological diversity and dispute
# follow a fairly routinized ritual and worship service that explicitly discourages spontaneous emotional expression
# train and employ professional clergy who must meet formal requirements for certification
# accept less extensive involvement from members than do sects, but more involvement than churches
# often draw disproportionately from the middle and upper classes of society

Most of the major Christian bodies formed post-reformation are denominations by this definition (e.g., [[Baptists]], [[Methodist]]s, [[Lutheran]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
{{main|Sect}}
Sociologically, a "sect" is defined as a newly formed religious group that formed to protest elements of its parent religion (generally a [[Religious denomination|denomination]]). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of [[apostasy]] or [[heresy]] in the parent denomination; they often decry liberal trends in denominational development and advocate a return to so-called "true" religion.

Leaders of sectarian movements (i.e., the formation of a new sect) tend to come from a lower socio-economic class than the members of the parent denomination, a component of sect development that is not yet entirely understood. Most scholars believe that when sect formation involves social class distinctions, they reflect an attempt to compensate for deficiencies in lower social status.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} An often seen result of such factors is the incorporation into the theology of the new sect a distaste for the adornments of the wealthy (e.g., jewelry or other signs of wealth).

After their formation, sects can take only three paths - dissolution, institutionalization, or eventual development into a denomination. If the sect withers in membership, it will dissolve. If the membership increases, the sect is forced to adopt the characteristics of denominations in order to maintain order (e.g., bureaucracy, explicit doctrine, etc.). And even if the membership does not grow or grows slowly, norms will develop to govern group activities and behavior. The development of norms results in a decrease in spontaneity, which is often one of the primary attractions of sects. The adoption of denomination-like characteristics can either turn the sect into a full-blown denomination or, if a conscious effort is made to maintain some of the spontaneity and protest components of sects, an ''institutionalized sect'' can result. Institutionalized sects are halfway between sects and denominations on the continuum of religious development. They have a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics. Examples include: [[Hutterites]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], and the [[Amish]].

Most of the well-known denominations of the U.S. existing today originated as sects breaking away from denominations (or Churches, in the case of [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]]). Examples include: [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

An example of an institutionalized sect that did not become a denomination are the [[Mennonites]]. 

==Cult typology==
{{main|Cult}}
The concept of "cult" has lagged behind in the refinement of the terms that are used in analyzing the other forms of religious origination. Bruce Campbell discusses Troeltsch's concept in defining cults as non-traditional religious groups that are based on belief in a divine element within the individual. He gives three ideal types of cults:

# a mystically-oriented illumination type
# an instrumental type, in which inner experience is sought solely for its effects
# a service-oriented type that is focused on aiding others.

He also gives six groups in the applications of analysis:  Theosophy, Wisdom of the Soul, Spiritualism, New Thought, Scientology, and Transcendental Meditation.

In the late nineteenth century, there have been a number of works that help in clarifying what is involved in cults.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara&lt;/ref&gt; There are several scholars of this subject, such as Joseph Campbell and Bruce Campbell, who have noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a divine element in the individual. It is either Soul, Self, or True Self.  Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and mysticism.&lt;ref name="Bruce Campbell 1978"/&gt; Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention. One is mystical and the other is instrumental.  This can divide the cults into being either occults or metaphysical assemblies.

On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual.  Other than the two main  types, there is also a third type.  This is service-oriented. Campbell states that "the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders." &lt;ref&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). "A Typology of Cults." ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cults or new religious movements{{Anchor|Cults or New Religious Movements}} ===
By sociological typology, ''cults'' are, like sects, new religious groups. But, unlike sects, they can form without breaking off from another religious group, though this is by no means always the case. The characteristic that most distinguishes cults from sects is that they are not advocating a return to ''pure'' religion but rather the embracing of something new or something that has been completely lost or forgotten (e.g., lost scriptures or new prophecy). Cults are also much more likely to be led by [[charismatic authority|charismatic leaders]] than are other religious groups and the charismatic leaders tend to be the individuals who bring forth the new or lost component that is the focal element of the cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Lorne L. | title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-19-542009-8 | pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cults, like sects, often integrate elements of existing religious theologies, but cults tend to create more esoteric theologies synthesized from many sources. Cults tend to emphasize the individual and individual peace.

Cults, like sects, can develop into denominations. As cults grow, they bureaucratize and develop many of the characteristics of denominations. Some scholars are hesitant to grant cults denominational status because many cults maintain their more esoteric characteristics. But given their closer semblance to denominations than to the ''cult'' type, it is more accurate to describe them as denominations.  Some denominations in the US that began as cults include [[Christian Science]] and the [[Nation of Islam]].

Finally, there is a push in the social [[scientific study of religion]] to begin referring to ''cults'' as ''New Religious Movements'' (NRMs). This is the result of the often pejorative and derogatory meanings attached to the word "''cult''" in popular language.

=== Criticism ===
Religious scholar [[John A. Saliba]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[John Saliba|Saliba, John]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ''Understanding new religious movements'' second edition 2003 {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} Altamira Press, book flap
&lt;/ref&gt; notes the many attempts to draw a classification or typology of cults and/or [[sect]]s, but concludes that the divergences that exist in these groups' practices, doctrines, and goals do not lend themselves to a simple classification that has universal approval. He argues that the influx of Eastern religious systems, including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Shintoism]], which do not fit within the traditional distinctions between church, sect, denomination and cult, have compounded typological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Meta-criticism ===
[[Lorne L. Dawson]] examines the history and future of the church-sect typology in a 2008 article, opining that the typology survives as a useful tool.&lt;ref&gt;

==Wallis' distinction between cults and sects==
The sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] (1945–1990) introduced differing definitions of [[sect]]s and [[cult]]s. He argued that a cult is characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member." According to Wallis, cults are generally described as "oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant, non-exclusive", making "few demands on members", without possessing a "clear distinction between members and non-members", having "a rapid turnover of membership", and are transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the "cultic milieu." Wallis contrasts a cult with a [[sect]] in that he asserts that sects are characterized by "[[epistemology|epistemological]] authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation, such as [[Collective Salvation|collective salvation]], and their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'."&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''[[The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology]]'' (1976) [http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html available online (bad scan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052348/http://whyaretheydead.net/krasel/books/wallis/wallis1.html |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614094446/http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and/or new religious movements==

=== Stark and Bainbridge ===
In 1975, the sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]]&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/NRM.htm |title=New Religious Movements |accessdate=2007-07-21 |last=Bromley |first=David |work=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society edited by William H. Swatos, Jr. Editor |publisher=Altamira press}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish three types of [[cult]]s, classified on the basis of the levels of organizational and [[customer|client]] (or adherent) involvement:&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saliba pages 140-141"&gt;[[John Saliba|Saliba, John]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] ''Understanding new religious movements'' second edition 2003 {{ISBN|0-7591-0356-9}} Altamira press, pages 140-141
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Audience cults'' which have hardly any organization because participants/consumers lack significant involvement.
* ''Client cults'', in which the service-providers exhibit a degree of organization in contrast to their clients. Client cults link into moderate-commitment social networks through which people exchange [[goods and services]]. The relationship between clients and the [[leadership|leader]]s of client cults resembles that of patients and therapists.
* ''Cult movements'', which seek to provide services that meet all of their adherents' spiritual needs, although they differ significantly in the degree to which they use mobilize adherents' time and commitment.

The sociologist [[Paul Schnabel]] has argued that the [[Church of Scientology]] originated from an ''audience cult'' (the readership of Hubbard's book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and the ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' article which had preceded it) into a ''client cult'' ([[Dianetics]]) then into a cult movement (the Church of Scientology).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel, Paul]] ''Tussen stigma en charisma: nieuwe religieuze bewegingen en geestelijke volksgezondheid''/''Between stigma and charisma: new religious movements and mental health'' [[Erasmus University]] Rotterdam, Faculty of Medicine, Ph.D. thesis, Dutch language, {{ISBN|90-6001-746-3}} (Deventer, Van Loghum Slaterus, 1982), pages 82, 84-88 &lt;br&gt;literal English translation: "Scientology is a fully developed innovative cult movement [...] Scientology grew out of a client cult (Dianetic) and an audience cult (Hubbard's books)"&lt;br&gt;Dutch original: "Scientology is een volledig ontwikkelde innovatieve cult movement [...] Scientology is voortgekomen uit een client cult (Dianetics) en een audience cult (de boeken van Hubbard)."&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''World-rejecting movements'' view the prevailing social order as deviant and a perversion of the divine plan. Such movements see the world as evil or at least as [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. They may adhere to [[millenarianism|millenarian]] beliefs. The [[International Society of Krishna Consciousness]] (a.k.a. "Hare Krishnas"), the [[Unification Church]], the [[Brahma Kumaris]] and the [[Family International|Children of God]] exemplify world-rejecting movements.
* ''World-accommodating movements'' draw clear distinctions between the spiritual and the worldly spheres. They have few or no consequences for the lives of adherents. These movements adapt to the world but they do not reject or affirm it.
* ''World-affirming movements'' might not have any [[ritual]]s or any formal [[ideology]]. They may lack most of the characteristics of religious movements. They affirm the world and merely claim to have the means to enable people to unlock their "[[Human Potential Movement|hidden potential]]". As examples of world-affirming movements, Wallis mentions [[Werner Erhard]]'s [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3251">'''Spent caustic''' is a waste industrial [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] solution that has become exhausted and is no longer useful (or spent). Spent caustics are made of [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], [[water]], and contaminants.  The contaminants have consumed the majority of the sodium (or potassium) hydroxide and thus the caustic liquor is spent, for example, in one common application [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (''gas'')]] is [[scrubber|scrubbed]] by the [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH (''aqueous'')]] to form NaHS (''aq'') and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''l''), thus consuming the caustic.

==Types==
* '''Ethylene spent caustic''' comes from the caustic scrubbing of cracked gas from an [[ethylene]] [[cracking (chemistry)|cracker]].  This liquor is produced by a caustic scrubbing tower.  Ethylene product gas is contaminated with {{chem|H|2|S}}(g) and {{CO2}}(g), and those contaminants are removed by absorption in the caustic scrubbing tower to produce {{chem|NaHS}}(aq) and {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}(aq). The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewater (ethylene spent caustic) is contaminated with the sulfides and carbonates and a small fraction of organic compounds.
*'''Refinery spent caustic''' comes from multiple sources: the [[Merox]] processing of [[gasoline]]; the Merox processing of [[kerosene]]/[[jet fuel]]; and the caustic scrubbing/Merox processing of [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. In these streams sulfides and organic acids are removed from the product streams into the caustic phase. The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewaters (cresylic for gasoline; naphthenic for kerosene/jet fuel; sulfidic for LPG -spent caustics) are often mixed and called '''refinery spent caustic'''. This spent caustic is contaminated with sulfides, carbonates, and in many cases a high fraction of heavy [[organic acids]].

==Treatment technologies==
Spent caustics are malodorous [[wastewater]]s that are difficult to treat in conventional [[wastewater]] processes. Typically the material is disposed of by high [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] with [[biotreatment]], deep well injection, [[incineration]], [[wet air oxidation]], [[Humid Peroxide Oxidation]] or other speciality processes. Most ethylene spent caustics are disposed of through wet air oxidation.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
The '''spring bloom''' is a strong increase in [[phytoplankton]] abundance (i.e. stock) that typically occurs in the early spring and lasts until late spring or early summer. This seasonal event is characteristic of temperate North Atlantic, sub-polar, and coastal waters.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;Mann, K.H., Lazier, J.R.N. (2006). ''Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems: Biological-Physical Interactions in the Oceans''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|1-4051-1118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, C.B. (2004). "Biological Oceanography" Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0-632-05536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phytoplankton blooms occur when growth exceeds losses, however there is no universally accepted definition of the magnitude of change or the threshold of abundance that constitutes a bloom. The magnitude, spatial extent and duration of a bloom depends on a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include light availability, nutrients, temperature, and physical processes that influence light availability,&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oviatt"&gt;Oviatt, C., Keller, A., and Reed, L.

==Classical mechanism==

In the spring, more light becomes available and stratification of the water column occurs as increasing temperatures warm the surface waters (referred to as thermal stratification). As a result, vertical mixing is inhibited and phytoplankton and nutrients are entrained in the euphotic zone.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; This creates a comparitvely high nutrient and high light environment that allows rapid phytoplankton growth.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Along with thermal stratification, spring blooms can be triggered by salinity stratification due to freshwater input, from sources such as high river runoff. This type of stratification is normally limited to coastal areas and estuaries, including Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;Harding, L. W. and Perry, E. S. (1997). "Long-term increase of phytoplankton biomass in Chesapeake Bay, 1950–94." Marine Ecological Progress Series 157: 39–52. {{doi|10.3354/meps157039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater influences primary productivity in two ways. First, because freshwater is less dense, it rests on top of seawater and creates a stratified water column.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt; Second, freshwater often carries nutrients &lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt; that phytoplankton need to carry out processes, including photosynthesis.

Rapid increases in phytoplankton growth, that typically occur during the spring bloom, arise because phytoplankton can reproduce rapidly under optimal growth conditions (i.e., high nutrient levels, ideal light and temperature, and minimal losses from grazing and vertical mixing). In terms of reproduction, many species of phytoplankton can double at least once per day, allowing for exponential increases in phytoplankton stock size. For example, the stock size of a population that doubles once per day will increase 1000-fold in just 10 days.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; In addition, there is a lag in the grazing response of herbivorous [[zooplankton]] at the start of blooms, which minimize phytoplankton losses. This lag occurs because there is low winter zooplankton abundance and many zooplankton, such as copepods, have longer generation times than phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Spring blooms typically last until late spring or early summer, at which time the bloom collapses due to nutrient depletion in the stratified water column and increased grazing pressure by zooplankton.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt; The most limiting nutrient in the marine environment is typically [[nitrogen]] (N). This is because most organisms are unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms (i.e. ammonium, nitrite, or nitrate). However, with the exception of coastal waters, it can be argued, that [[iron]] (Fe) is the most limiting nutrient because it is required to fix nitrogen, but is only available in small quantities in the marine environment, coming from dust storms and leaching from rocks.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; [[Phosphorus]] can also be limiting, particularly in freshwater environments and tropical coastal regions.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

During winter, wind-driven turbulence and cooling water temperatures break down the stratified [[water column]] formed during the summer. This breakdown allows vertical mixing of the water column and replenishes nutrients from deep water to the surface waters and the rest of the [[euphotic zone]]. However, vertical mixing also causes high losses, as phytoplankton are carried below the euphotic zone (so their [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] exceeds primary production). In addition, reduced illumination (intensity and daily duration) during winter limits growth rates.

==Alternative mechanisms==

Historically, blooms have been explained by Sverdrup's [[critical depth]] hypothesis, which says blooms are caused by shoaling of the mixed layer. Similarly, Winder and Cloern (2010) described spring blooms as a response to increasing temperature and light availability.&lt;ref name="Winder"&gt;Winder, M. and Cloern, J.E. (2010). "The annual cycles of phytoplankton biomass". Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 365: 3215–3226. {{doi|10.1098/rstb.2010.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new explanations have been offered recently, including that blooms occur due to:
*Coupling between phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing.&lt;ref name="Behrenfeld"&gt;Behrenfeld, M.J. (2010). "Abandoning Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis on phytoplankton blooms". Ecology 91:977–989. {{doi|10.1890/09-1207.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The onset of near surface stratification in the spring.&lt;ref name="Chiswell"&gt;Chiswell, S. M., 2011, The spring phytoplankton bloom: don’t abandon Sverdrup completely: Marine Ecology Progress Series, v. 443, p. 39-50 - {{doi|10.3354/meps09453}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mixing of the water column, rather than stratification &lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;Townsend, D.W., Cammen, L.M., Holligan, P.M., Campbell, D.E., Pettigrew, N.R. (1994). "Causes and consequences of variability in the timing of spring phytoplankton blooms". Deep-Sea Research 41: 747-765&lt;/ref&gt;
*Low turbulence &lt;ref name="Huisman"&gt;Huisman, J., van Oostveen, P., Weissing, F.J. (1999). "Critical depth and critical turbulence: two different mechanisms for the development of phytoplankton blooms." Limnological Oceanography 44: 1781-1787&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increasing light intensity (in shallow water environments).&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Northward progression==

At greater [[latitudes]], spring blooms take place later in the year. This northward progression is because spring occurs later, delaying thermal stratification and increases in illumination that promote blooms. A study by Wolf and Woods (1988) showed evidence that spring blooms follow the northward migration of the 12&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm, suggesting that blooms may be controlled by temperature limitations, in addition to stratification.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

At high latitudes, the shorter warm season commonly results in one mid-summer bloom. These blooms tend to be more intense than spring blooms of temperate areas because there is a longer duration of daylight for photosynthesis to take place. Also, grazing pressure tends to be lower because the generally cooler temperatures at higher latitudes slow zooplankton metabolism.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Species succession==

The spring bloom often consists of a series of sequential blooms of different phytoplankton species. Succession occurs because different species have optimal nutrient uptake at different ambient concentrations and reach their growth peaks at different times. Shifts in the dominant phytoplankton species are likely caused by biological and physical (i.e. environmental) factors.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; For instance, [[diatom]] growth rate becomes limited when the supply of [[silicate]] is depleted.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen"&gt;Kristiansen, S., Farbrot, T., and Naustvoll, L. (2001). "Spring bloom nutrient dynamics in the Oslofjord". Marine Ecology Progress Series 219: 41–49&lt;/ref&gt; Since silicate is not required by other phytoplankton, such as [[dinoflagellates]], their growth rates continue to increase.

For example, in oceanic environments, diatoms (cells diameter greater than 10 to 70&amp;nbsp;µm or larger) typically dominate first because they are capable of growing faster. Once silicate is depleted in the environment, diatoms are succeeded by smaller dinoflagellates.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristiansen" /&gt; This scenario has been observed in Rhode Island,&lt;ref name="Smayda1957"&gt;Smayda, T.J.(1957). "Phytoplankton studies in lower Narragansett Bay". Limnology and Oceanography 2(4) 342-359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;Nixon, S.W., Fulweiler, R.W., Buckley, B.A., Granger, S.L., Nowicki, B.L., Henry, K.M. (2009). "The impact of changing climate on phenology, productivity, and benthic-pelagic coupling in Narragansett Bay". Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 82: 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, D.M.(1959). "The phytoplankton of Narragansett Bay". Limnology and Oceanography 4(4) 425-440&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bay.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;Hunt, C.D., Borkman, D.G., Libby, P.S., Lacouture, R., Turner, J.T., and Mickelson, M.J. (2010). "Phytoplankton Patterns in Massachusetts Bay—1992–2007". Estuaries and Coasts 33: 448–470. {{doi|10.1007/s12237-008-9125-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of a spring bloom, when most nutrients have been depleted, the majority of the total phytoplankton [[biomass]] is very small phytoplankton, known as ultraphytoplankton (cell diameter &lt;5 to 10&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Ultraphytoplankton can sustain low, but constant stocks, in nutrient depleted environments because they have a larger [[surface area to volume ratio]], which offers a much more effective rate of [[diffusion]].&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The types of phytoplankton comprising a bloom can be determined by examination of the varying photosynthetic pigments found in [[chloroplasts]] of each species.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Variability and the influence of climate change==

Variability in the patterns (e.g. timing of onset, duration, magnitude, position, and spatial extent) of annual spring bloom events has been well documented.&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt; These variations occur due to fluctuations in environmental conditions, such as wind intensity, temperature, freshwater input, and light. Consequently, spring bloom patterns are likely sensitive to [[global climate change]].

Links have been found between temperature and spring bloom patterns. For example, several studies have reported a correlation between earlier spring bloom onset and temperature increases over time.&lt;ref name="Winder" /&gt; Furthermore, in Long Island Sound and the Gulf of Maine, blooms begin later in the year, are more productive, and last longer during colder years, while years that are warmer exhibit earlier, shorter blooms of greater magnitude.&lt;ref name="Smayda" /&gt;

Temperature may also regulate bloom sizes. In Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, a study by Durbin et al. (1992)&lt;ref name="Durbin"&gt;Durbin, A.G. and Durbin, E.G. (1992). "Seasonal changes in size frequency distribution and estimated age in the marine copepod Acartia hudsortica during a winter-spring diatom bloom in Narragansett Bay". Limnol. Oceanogr., 37(2): 379-392&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that a 2&amp;nbsp;°C increase in water temperature resulted in a three-week shift in the maturation of the copepod, ''Acartia hudsonica'', which could significantly increase zooplankton grazing intensity. Oviatt et al. (2002) &lt;ref name="Oviatt" /&gt; noted a reduction in spring bloom intensity and duration in years when winter water temperatures were warmer. Oviatt et al. suggested that the reduction was due to increased grazing pressure, which could potentially become intense enough to prevent spring blooms from occurring altogether.

Miller and Harding (2007) &lt;ref name="MillerWD"&gt;Miller, W.D. and Harding Jr., L.W. (2007). "Climate forcing of the spring bloom in Chesapeake Bay". Marine Ecology Progress Series 331: 11–22&lt;/ref&gt; suggested climate change (influencing winter weather patterns and freshwater influxes) was responsible for shifts in spring bloom patterns in the Chesapeake Bay. They found that during warm, wet years (as opposed to cool, dry years), the spatial extent of blooms was larger and was positioned more seaward. Also, during these same years, biomass was higher and peak biomass occurred later in the spring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7677">'''Test and evaluation master plan''' ('''TEMP''') is a critical aspect of [[project management]] involving complex systems that must satisfy specification requirements. The TEMP is used to support programmatic events called milestone decisions that separate the individual phases of a project. For military systems, the level of funding determines the Acquisition Category and the organization responsible for the milestone decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/dte/docs/Guide-on-Incorporating-TE-into-DoD-Acquisition-Contracts.pdf|title=Incorporating Test and Evaluation into DoD Acquisition Contracts|publisher = Defense Acquisition University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.if.uidaho.edu/~beitgeor/SysE_511/Documents/Test%20and%20Evaluation%20Master%20Plan.pdf|title=Test and Evaluation Master Plan Procedures and Guidelines|publisher=University of Idaho, Idaho Falls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[traceability matrix]] is generally used to link items within the TEMP to items within [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]].

== Definition ==

The Test and Evaluation Master Plan documents the overall structure and objectives of the Test &amp; Evaluation for a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://dap.dau.mil/acquipedia/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=536dd9a1-f4c6-4b10-8485-d324f36d88f5
| title = Test &amp; Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)
| accessdate = 6 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers activities over a program’s life-cycle and identifies evaluation criteria for the testers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.acqnotes.com/acqnote/careerfields/test-and-evaluation-master-plan-temp
| title = Test &amp; Evaluation, Test and Evaluation Master Plan
| accessdate = 6 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test and evaluation master plan consists of individual tests. Each test contains the following.
* Test Scenario
* Data Collection
* Performance Evaluation

===Test scenario===

The ''test scenario'' establishes test conditions. This is typically associated with a specific mission profile. For military systems, this would be a combat scenario, and it may involve Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). For commercial systems, this would involve a specific kind of situation involving the use of the item being developed.

For example, cold weather operation may require operation to be evaluated at temperatures below &lt;math&gt;-40^o&lt;/math&gt;C using an environmental chamber. Evaluation of operation with a vehicle interface may require compatibility evaluation with a [[Vibration#Vibration testing|vibration test]]. Evaluation of an Internet store would require the system to take the user through a product purchase while the system is loaded with other traffic.

The test scenario identifies the following.
* Items required for testing
* Instructions to set up the items that will be used during the test
* General description for how to operate the system under test
* Specific actions and events that will take place during the test

===Data collection===

''Data collection'' identifies information that must be collected during the test. This involves preliminary setup before the test begins. This may involve preparation for any of the following.

* Settings for the system under test
* Separate instrumentation
* Written notes from direct observation
* Sample collection

Systems that incorporate a computer typically require the ability to extract and record specific kinds of data from the system while it is operating normally.

Electronic data collection may be started and stopped as one of the actions described in the test scenario.

When data access is restricted, so the transfer of data between organizations may require a ''Data Collection Plan''. This can occur with [[Classified information|classified military systems]].

Data is analyzed after testing is complete. This analysis is called performance evaluation.

===Performance evaluation===

'''Measures of effectiveness''' are specific metrics that are used to measure results in the overall mission and execution of assigned tasks.

These may have flexible performance limits associated with the outcome of a specific event. For example, the first round fired from a gun aimed using a radar would not impact a specific location, but the position can be measured using the radar, so the system should be able to deliver a round within a specific radius after several rounds have been fired. The number of rounds required to land one inside the limit is the MOE. The radius would be a Measure Of Performance (MOP).

'''Measures of performance''' are specific metrics that have a pass or fail limit that must be satisfied. These are generally identified with the words ''shall'' or ''must'' in the specification.

One type of MOP is the distance that a vehicle with a specific load must travel at a specific speed before running out of fuel.

Another type of MOP is the distance that a radar can detect a 1 square meter reflector.

'''Measures of suitability''' evaluate the ability to be supported in its intended operational environment.

As an example, this may be an evaluation of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) that is evaluated during other testing. A system with excessive failures may satisfy all other requirements and not be suitable for use. A gun that jams when dirty is not suitable for military use.

These requirements are associated with ilities.
* Reliability
* Availability
* Maintainability
* Supportability
* Usability

==Purpose==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The results of the TEMP evaluation are used for multiple purposes.
* Rejection: funding termination decision
* Redesign: modification and re-test funding decision
* Full rate production: acceptance funding decision
* Mission planning

Mission planning involves translation of MOEs, MOPs, and MOSs into the following.

* Required Operational Capability (ROC)
* Projected Operational Environment (POE)
* Diagnostic Testing via [[Built-in self-test|built-in test]] (BIT) or [[planned maintenance]]

ROC and POE are specific expectations evaluated by the TEMP that are used to determine how to deploy assets to satisfy a specific mission requirement. Diagnostic testing ensures these expectations are satisfied for the duration of the mission.

==Other usages==
The term 'test and evaluation master plan' as a distinct overall guide to the Test and Evaluation functions in a development has also been used by the Australian Department of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| ISBN= 0642-80612-8

{{More footnotes|date=February 2009}}
In [[software testing]], '''test automation''' is the use of special [[software]] (separate from the software being tested) to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam |author2=Huizinga, Dorota  | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=74| isbn = 978-0-470-04212-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for [[continuous delivery]] and [[continuous testing]].

==Overview==
Some [[software testing]] tasks, such as extensive low-level interface [[regression testing]], can be laborious and time-consuming to do manually. In addition, a manual approach might not always be effective in finding certain classes of defects. Test automation offers a possibility to perform these types of testing effectively. Once automated tests have been developed, they can be run quickly and repeatedly. Many times, this can be a cost-effective method for regression testing of software products that have a long maintenance life. Even minor patches over the lifetime of the application can cause existing features to break which were working at an earlier point in time.

There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general approaches used widely:

* '''[[Graphical user interface testing]]'''. A testing framework that generates [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the observable behavior of the program is correct.
* '''[[API testing|API driven testing]]'''. A testing framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user interface altogether. It can also be testing [[public interface|public (usually) interfaces]] to classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to validate that the results that are returned are correct.

Test automation tools can be expensive, and are usually employed in combination with manual testing. Test automation can be made cost-effective in the long term, especially when used repeatedly in [[regression testing]]. A good candidate for test automation is a test case for common flow of an application, as it is required to be executed (regression testing) every time an enhancement is made in the application. Test automation reduces the effort associated with manual testing. Manual effort is needed to develop and maintain automated checks, as well as reviewing test results.

In automated testing the test engineer or [[software quality assurance]] person must have software coding ability, since the test cases are written in the form of source code which, when run, produce output according to the [[Assertion (computing)|assertion]]s that are a part of it. Some test automation tools allow for test authoring to be done by keywords instead of coding, which do not require programming.

One way to generate test cases automatically is [[model-based testing]] through use of a model of the system for test case generation, but research continues into a variety of alternative methodologies for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In some cases, the model-based approach enables non-technical users to create automated business test cases in plain English so that no programming of any kind is needed in order to configure them for multiple operating systems, browsers, and smart devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4578383|title=Proceedings from the 5th International Conference on Software Testing and Validation (ICST). Software Competence Center Hagenberg. "Test Design: Lessons Learned and Practical Implications.|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4578383|isbn=978-0-7381-5746-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What to automate, when to automate, or even whether one really needs automation are crucial decisions which the testing (or development) team must make.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=ART&amp;ObjectId=2010| title=When Should a Test Be Automated?| author=Brian Marick| publisher=StickyMinds.com| accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multi-vocal literature review of 52 practitioner and 26 academic sources found that five main factors to consider in test automation decision are: 1) System Under Test (SUT), 2) the types and numbers of tests, 3) test-tool, 4) human and organizational topics, and 5) cross-cutting factors. The most frequent individual factors identified in the study were: need for regression testing, economic factors, and maturity of SUT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garousi|first=Vahid|last2=Mäntylä|first2=Mika V.|date=2016-08-01|title=When and what to automate in software testing? A multi-vocal literature review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584916300702|journal=Information and Software Technology|volume=76|pages=92–117|doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2016.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unit testing ==
A growing trend in software development is the use of [[unit testing]] frameworks such as the [[xUnit]] frameworks (for example, [[JUnit]] and [[NUnit]]) that allow the execution of unit tests to determine whether various sections of the [[code]] are acting as expected under various circumstances. [[Test case]]s describe tests that need to be run on the program to verify that the program runs as expected.

Test automation mostly using unit testing is a key feature of [[extreme programming]] and [[agile software development]], where it is known as [[test-driven development]] (TDD) or test-first development. Unit tests can be written to define the functionality ''before'' the code is written. However, these unit tests evolve and are extended as coding progresses, issues are discovered and the code is subjected to refactoring.&lt;ref name="Learning TDD"&gt;''Learning Test-Driven Development by Counting Lines''; Bas Vodde &amp; Lasse Koskela; IEEE Software Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Only when all the tests for all the demanded features pass is the code considered complete. Proponents argue that it produces software that is both more reliable and less costly than code that is tested by manual exploration.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is considered more reliable because the code coverage is better, and because it is run constantly during development rather than once at the end of a [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] development cycle. The developer discovers defects immediately upon making a change, when it is least expensive to fix. Finally, [[code refactoring]] is safer when unit testing is used; transforming the code into a simpler form with less [[code duplication]], but equivalent behavior, is much less likely to introduce new defects when the refactored code is covered by unit tests.

==Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing==
{{main article|Graphical user interface testing}}

Many test automation tools provide record and playback features that allow users to interactively record user actions and replay them back any number of times, comparing actual results to those expected. The advantage of this approach is that it requires little or no [[software development]]. This approach can be applied to any application that has a [[graphical user interface]]. However, reliance on these features poses major reliability and maintainability problems. Relabelling a button or moving it to another part of the window may require the test to be re-recorded. Record and playback also often adds irrelevant activities or incorrectly records some activities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A variation on this type of tool is for testing of web sites. Here, the "interface" is the web page. However, such a framework utilizes entirely different techniques because it is rendering [[HTML]] and listening to [[DOM Events]] instead of operating system events. [[Headless browser]]s or solutions based on [[Selenium (Software)#Selenium WebDriver|Selenium Web Driver]] are normally used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Headless Testing with Browsers; https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Headless Testing with Browsers"&gt;Headless Testing with PhantomJS;http://phantomjs.org/headless-testing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Automated User Interface Testing; https://www.devbridge.com/articles/automated-user-interface-testing/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of this type of test automation tool is for testing mobile applications. This is very useful given the number of different sizes, resolutions, and operating systems used on mobile phones. For this variation, a framework is used in order to instantiate actions on the mobile device and to gather results of the actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Beginner's Guide to Automated Mobile App Testing {{!}} Testmunk Blog|url = http://blog.testmunk.com/tutorial-for-automated-mobile-app-testing-calabash/|website = blog.testmunk.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17|last = Testmunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2015|reason=this not a reliable source, it's a blog from someone who is not a recognized expert in the field.}}

Another variation is script-less test automation that does not use record and playback, but instead builds a model{{clarify|date=June 2016}} of the application and then enables the tester to create test cases by simply inserting test parameters and conditions, which requires no scripting skills.

==API driven testing==
[[API testing]] is also being widely used by software testers due to the difficulty of creating and maintaining GUI-based automation testing. It involves directly testing [[API]]s as part of [[integration testing]], to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.&lt;ref name="reichart1"&gt;[http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/Testing-APIs-protects-applications-and-reputations Testing APIs protects applications and reputations], by Amy Reichert, SearchSoftwareQuality March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since APIs lack a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], API testing is performed at the [[Communications protocol#Layering|message layer]].&lt;ref name="stickyminds"&gt;[http://www.stickyminds.com/interview/all-about-api-testing-interview-jonathan-cooper All About API Testing: An Interview with Jonathan Cooper], by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; API testing is considered critical when an API serves as the primary interface to [[application logic]] since [[Graphical user interface testing|GUI tests]] can be difficult to maintain with the short release cycles and frequent changes commonly used with [[agile software development]] and [[DevOps]].&lt;ref name="forrblog"&gt;[http://blogs.forrester.com/diego_lo_giudice/15-04-23-the_forrester_wave_evaluation_of_functional_test_automation_fta_is_out_and_its_all_about_going_be?cm_mmc=RSS-_-BT-_-63-_-blog_1769 The Forrester Wave™ Evaluation Of Functional Test Automation (FTA) Is Out And It's All About Going Beyond GUI Testing], by Diego Lo Giudice, [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] April 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layers"&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/document/2645817?ref=QuickSearch Produce Better Software by Using a Layered Testing Strategy], by  Sean Kenefick, [[Gartner]] January 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous testing==
[[Continuous testing]] is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate.&lt;ref name="essential"&gt;[https://www.techwell.com/techwell-insights/2015/08/part-pipeline-why-continuous-testing-essential Part of the Pipeline: Why Continuous Testing Is Essential], by  Adam Auerbach, TechWell Insights August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stickym"&gt;[http://www.stickyminds.com/interview/relationship-between-risk-and-continuous-testing-interview-wayne-ariola The Relationship between Risk and Continuous Testing: An Interview with Wayne Ariola], by Cameron Philipp-Edmonds, Stickyminds December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For Continuous Testing, the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.&lt;ref name="pnsqc"&gt;[http://uploads.pnsqc.org/2015/papers/t-007_Ariola_paper.pdf DevOps: Are You Pushing Bugs to Clients Faster],  by  Wayne Ariola and Cynthia Dunlop, PNSQC October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==What to test==
Testing tools can help automate tasks such as product installation, test data creation, GUI interaction, problem detection (consider parsing or polling agents equipped with [[test oracle]]s), defect logging, etc., without necessarily automating tests in an end-to-end fashion.

One must keep satisfying popular requirements when thinking of test automation:
* [[Computing platform|Platform]] and [[Operating system|OS]] independence
* Data driven capability (Input Data, Output Data, [[Metadata]])
* Customization Reporting (DB [[Data Base]] Access, [[Crystal Reports]]
* Easy debugging and logging
* [[Version control]] friendly – minimal binary files
* Extensible &amp; Customization (Open [[API]]s to be able to integrate with other tools)
* Common Driver (For example, in the Java development ecosystem, that means [[Apache Ant|Ant]] or [[Apache Maven|Maven]] and the popular [[Integrated Development Environment|IDEs]]). This enables tests to integrate with the developers' [[workflows]].
* Support unattended test runs for integration with build processes and batch runs. [[Continuous integration]] servers require this.
* Email Notifications like [[bounce message]]s
* Support distributed execution environment (distributed [[Testbed|test bed]])
* Distributed application support (distributed [[System Under Test|SUT]])

==Framework approach in automation==
A test automation framework is an integrated system that sets the rules of automation of a specific product. This system integrates the function libraries, test data sources, object details and various reusable modules. These components act as small building blocks which need to be assembled to represent a business process. The framework provides the basis of test automation and simplifies the automation effort.

The main advantage of a [[Software framework|framework]] of assumptions, concepts and tools that provide support for automated software testing is the low cost for [[Software maintenance|maintenance]]. If there is change to any [[test case]] then only the test case file needs to be updated and the [[driver Script]] and [[startup script]] will remain the same. Ideally, there is no need to update the scripts in case of changes to the application.

Choosing the right framework/scripting technique helps in maintaining lower costs. The costs associated with test scripting are due to development and maintenance efforts. The approach of scripting used during test automation has effect on costs.

Various framework/scripting techniques are generally used:
# Linear (procedural code, possibly generated by tools like those that use record and playback)
# Structured (uses control structures - typically ‘if-else’, ‘switch’, ‘for’, ‘while’ conditions/ statements)
# [[Data-driven testing|Data-driven]] (data is persisted outside of tests in a database, spreadsheet, or other mechanism)
# [[Keyword-driven testing|Keyword-driven]]
# Hybrid (two or more of the patterns above are used)
# Agile automation framework

The Testing framework is responsible for:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# defining the format in which to express expectations
# creating a mechanism to hook into or drive the application under test
# executing the tests
# reporting results

===Test automation interface===
Test automation interface are platforms that provide a single [[workspace]] for incorporating multiple testing tools and frameworks for [[system testing|System/Integration testing]] of application under test. The goal of Test Automation Interface is to simplify the process of mapping tests to business criteria without coding coming in the way of the process. Test automation interface are expected to improve the efficiency and flexibility of maintaining test scripts.&lt;ref name = "Interface"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Test Automation Interface.png|thumb|Test Automation Interface Model]]

Test Automation Interface consists of the following core modules:
* Interface Engine
* Interface Environment
* Object Repository

===Interface engine===
Interface engines are built on top of Interface Environment. Interface engine consists of a [[parser]] and a test runner. The parser is present to parse the object files coming from the object repository into the test specific scripting language. The test runner executes the test scripts using a [[test harness]].&lt;ref name = "Interface" /&gt;

===Object repository===
Object repositories are a collection of UI/Application object data recorded by the testing tool while exploring the application under test.&lt;ref name = "Interface" /&gt;

==Defining boundaries between automation framework and a testing tool==
Tools are specifically designed to target some particular test environment, such as Windows and web automation tools, etc. Tools serve as a driving agent for an automation process. However, an automation framework is not a tool to perform a specific task, but rather infrastructure that provides the solution where different tools can do their job in a unified manner. This provides a common platform for the automation engineer.

There are various types of frameworks. They are categorized on the basis of the automation component they leverage. These are:
# [[Data-driven testing]]
# [[Modularity-driven testing]]
# [[Keyword-driven testing]]
# [[Hybrid testing]]
# [[Model-based testing]]
# Code-driven testing
# [[Behavior driven development]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aviation]], '''tufts''' are strips of yarn or string, typically around {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}}, attached to an aircraft surface in a grid pattern and imaged during flight. The motion of the tufts during flight can be observed and recorded, to locate flow features such as boundary layer separation and reattachment. Tufting is, therefore, a technique for [[flow visualization]]. They are used in [[aeronautics]] flight testing to study air flow direction, strength, and [[boundary layer]] properties.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''Viral metagenomics''' is the study of viral genetic material sourced directly from the environment rather than from a host or natural reservoir. The goal is to ascertain viral diversity in the environment that is often missed in studies targeting specific potential reservoirs. It reveals important information on [[virus]] evolution and the [[genetic diversity]] of the viral community without the need for isolating [[viral species]] and cultivating them in the laboratory. With the new available techniques that exploit [[Next-generation sequencing|NGS]], it was possible to study the [[virome]] of some ecosystems, even if the analysis has still some issues, in particular for the lack of universal markers. Some of the first metagenomic studies of viruses were done with ocean samples, and revealed that most of the sequences of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] viruses had no matches in databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angly FE, Felts B, Breitbart M, Salamon P, Edwards RA, Carlson C, Chan AM, Haynes M, Kelley S, Liu H, Mahaffy JM, Mueller JE, Nulton J, Olson R, Parsons R, Rayhawk S, Suttle CA, Rohwer F|date=2006|title=The marine viromes of four oceanic regions|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=4|issue=11|page=e368|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040368|pmc=1634881|pmid=17090214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Culley|first1=A.

== The Global Virome Project ==
The aim of the Global Virome Project is to expand the viral discovery to reduce the risk of harm for new viral large-scale outbreak. It is centered on the massive collection and sequencing of the majority of the planet’s unknown viruses. In fact, it was estimated that between 631,000 to 827,000 yet-to-be-discovered viral species in animal reservoirs (as mammal and bird host) are estimated to have a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic potential]]. Total transparency of the data acquired, and the correlated possible development of some medical products (vaccine) are two main benefits of this project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Dennis|last2=Daszak|first2=Peter|last3=Wolfe|first3=Nathan D.|last4=Gao|first4=George F.|last5=Morel|first5=Carlos M.|last6=Morzaria|first6=Subhash|last7=Pablos-Méndez|first7=Ariel|last8=Tomori|first8=Oyewale|last9=Mazet|first9=Jonna A. K.|date=2018-02-23|title=The Global Virome Project|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872|journal=Science|language=en|volume=359|issue=6378|pages=872–874|doi=10.1126/science.aap7463|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29472471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main limit of this project is the cost. To analyse the majority of viruses with a zoonotic potential, the total cost has been estimated around $1.2 billion. Another GVP’s aim is also to improve the possibility to detect with low cost sequencing viruses also in developing countries in order to avoid possible outbreaks''.'' For a worldwide sample collection some network between different agencies and nations must be created. For example, the USAID (agency for international development) EPT (Emerging Pandemic Threats) PREDICT project is included in this plan and it is focused on the study of the biology of some dangerous viruses, such as [[Ebola virus|Ebola]], [[Lassa fever]], [[Rift Valley fever]] and [[avian influenza]]. PREDICT project was founded also to discover new viral species in the animal reservoir host and individuate the main characteristics that can cause the viral transmission to human, to avoid the viral outbreak in the population. Next-generation sequencing can help the massive sequencing of this viral genome samples collected, allowing the increase of speed and efficiency and moreover reducing the cost of sequencing. To validate the possibility for these new-discovered viruses to be transmitted from animal to human, new approaches must be developed for the study of their [[Pathogenicity factor|pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|date=2018-10-11|title=The virome hunters|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4268|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=36|issue=10|pages=916–919|doi=10.1038/nbt.4268|issn=1087-0156|pmid=30307913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Virome Project could help the current pandemic surveillance, diagnosis techniques and prevention strategies, as far as helping for pre-emptive production of vaccine and other countermeasures for candidate high-risk viruses. Another benefit of this research could be a deeper comprehension of the viral biology. Its discovers can be applied not only for medical need, but also in other field as the agricultural and food one, for example to enhance biosecurity of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Methods ==
=== Metagenomic approach ===
It is used to sequence all the microbial genomes in a sample by using the [[Shotgun sequencing|Shotgun]] approach. Its aim is to identify all the genes present in the sample, mainly in order to provide information about drug-resistance. The sensitivity of this method is affected by the presence of contaminating nucleic acids from the host and other microorganisms. This method has been used for the sequencing of viruses like [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) and [[Hepatitis C|HCV]]. It may be used also to inform about cancer evolution and integrated virus genomes in cases of virus-associated cancers. This method requires a low number of [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] cycles, so the consequent risk of contamination is decreased. Although no primers or probes are required, the cost to obtain enough data is high.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houldcroft|first=Charlotte J.|last2=Beale|first2=Mathew A.|last3=Breuer|first3=Judith|date=2017-01-16|title=Clinical and biological insights from viral genome sequencing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.182|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=15|issue=3|pages=183–192|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.182|issn=1740-1526|pmid=28090077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PCR amplicon enrichment ===
Its aim is to identify the organism and in order to do that, it enriches a portion of the genome of the virus before sequencing. For the amplification it uses specific primers for a highly-conserved target sequence. This method has been used to track Ebola virus and [[Zika virus]] during their outbreaks or to sequence the whole genome of [[Human cytomegalovirus|HCMV]]. Another possible application is the monitoring of mutations associated to drug-resistance in order to administer the more efficient drug to the patient. Although this method is cheaper than the metagenomic approach and has a great specificity and sensitivity, it has some limits: it requires many PCR cycles so it can introduce mutations and contaminants and the primers may be subjected to mismatches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target enrichment ===
It is an overlapping PCR method. It doesn’t require a culture step because it sequences the whole viral genome directly from the clinical sample. Small [[Oligonucleotide|oligonucleotides]], complementary to the target, are used as probes for a [[Hybridization assay|hybridization]] reaction. The probes can be bound to a solid phase or to [[Magnetic bead|magnetic beads]] in liquid phase. Capture is followed by a small number of PCR cycles and Shotgun sequencing. This method can be used to compare the genome of healthy cells and of tumoral cells in cases of virus-associated cancer. It has been used to characterize HCV, [[Hsv 1|HSV-1]], HCMV and other viruses. The presence of overlapping probes increases the tolerance for primer mismatches but their design requires high cost and time so a rapid response is limited. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
