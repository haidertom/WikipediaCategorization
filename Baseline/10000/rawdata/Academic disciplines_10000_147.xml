'''30th Central Scientific Research Institute, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]]''' (Name in Russian - 30-й центральный научно-исследовательский институт Министерства обороны Российской Федерации) was a scientific research organization operated by the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]] which was dedicated to leading a wide range of studies in support of enhancing the [[Russian Air Force| Russian Air Force's]] capabilities and development of the aerospace warfighting methods, technologies and complexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.old.mil.ru/releases/2006/01/181527_12003.shtml Website of the Russian Ministry of Defence. 45th Anniversary of the TsNII-30. Air Force press release of 18.01.2006]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed on February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-language sources, the institute is often mentioned by the transliteration of its Russian abbreviation – TsNII-30.   
The institute was located in [[Shchyolkovo]] ({{lang-ru|Щёлково}}), [[Moscow Oblast]] at the [[Chkalovsky Airport]].

In 2010, TsNII-30 was reorganized and became an organizational unit of the {{Interlanguage link multi|4th Central Scientific Research Institute|ru|3=4-й центральный научно-исследовательский институт Министерства обороны Российской Федерации}}, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bazazakonov.ru/doc/index.php?ID=2206728 |title=Minister of Defence order of May 24, 2010 N 551 "On Reorganization of the federal state entities of the Ministry of Defence" |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042720/http://bazazakonov.ru/doc/index.php?ID=2206728 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=EXP;n=488230) из первоисточника 16 января 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

TsNII-30 has operated for exactly 50 years.

== History ==
TsNII-30 was established on January 16, 1961.

Its original name was the Central Scientific Research Institute, Russian Air Force. It was based on the Ministry of Defence Computer Center No. 3 in [[Noginsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]]. The center got the status of one of the TsNII-30 organizational units - Air Force Control Systems Research Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://anatoliy-artemyev.narod.ru/files/hroniki/04/4_0.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125415/http://anatoliy-artemyev.narod.ru/files/hroniki/04/4_0.htm |archive-date=2013-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — {{Interlanguage link multi|Научно-исследовательский центр систем управления ВВС|ru}}.
Later, TsNII-15, Russian Navy research institute, located in [[Leningrad]] was amalgamated with the TsNII-30 and became its subsidiary focused on the Navy aviation.

As of 2006, the institute's workforce had 16 [[Doctor of Science|Doctors of Science]] and 215 Ph.Ds ([[Candidate of Sciences|Candidates of Science]]).

The TsNII-30 has closely cooperated  with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Scientific Council of the Russian Air Force|ru|3=Научно-технический комитет Военно-воздушных сил}}, other Ministry of Defence research institutes (TsNII-46, TsNII-4, TsNII-16, etc.),  defence industry research institutes ([[GosNIIAS]], [[Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development]], [[TsAGI]], etc.), aviation design bureaus ([[Tupolev]], [[Mikoyan]], [[Antonov]], [[Yakovlev]], [[Ilyushin]], and Russian Academy of Sciences’ organizations.

=== Scope of Activities and Projects ===

The fields of the TsNII-30 research included strategic, tactical, technical, economical studies.
Some of areas of the activities were:

*[[Threat assessment]] and forecasting.
*Defining operational and technical requirements.
*Monitoring defence industry progress on the Russian Air Force acquisitions.
*Performance evaluations of the newly developed aerospace technologies and complexes.

[[Systems thinking|Systems approach]] to the development and procurement of the aerospace warfighting means and [[simulation modeling]] were the corner stones of the TsNII-30 research methodology.

TsNII-30 was part of a broad Russian aerospace industry cooperation to build:

'''Automatic and controlled processes''' ('''ACP''') are the two categories of cognitive processing. All cognitive processes fall into one or both of those two categories. The amounts of "processing power", [[attention]], and effort a process requires is the primary factor used to determine whether it's a controlled or an automatic process. An automatic process is capable of occurring without the need for attention, and the awareness of the initiation or operation of the process, and without drawing upon general processing resources or interfering with other concurrent thought processes.&lt;ref name="Bargh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bargh|first=John|title=Unintended Thought|year=1989|publisher=Guilford Publications|author2=James S. Uleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, an automatic process is unintentional, involuntary, effortless (not consumptive of limited processing capacity), and occurring outside awareness. Controlled processes are defined as a process that is under the flexible, intentional control of the individual, that he or she is consciously aware of, and that are effortful and constrained by the amount of attentional resources available at the moment.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Automatic processes===
When examining the label "automatic" in social psychology, we find that some processes are intended, and others require recent conscious and intentional processing of related information. That being said automatic effects fall into three classes: Those that occur prior to conscious awareness (preconscious); those that require some form of conscious processing but that produce an unintended outcome (postconscious); and those that require a specific type of intentional, goal directed processing (goal-dependent).

Preconscious automaticity requires only the triggering [[proximal]] stimulus event, and occur prior to or in the absence of any conscious awareness of that event.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; Because they occur without our conscious awareness they are unnoticeable, uncontrollable, and nearly effortless. Many previous studies suggest that the mere perception of the physical behaviors of others, as well as abstract categories (race, gender, role-related) that occurs passively in person perception results in increased tendencies to behave in the same way oneself.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bargh|first=John|author2=Kay L.

Boothby |title=Automaticity in social-cognitive processes|year=2012|location=Yale University, Department of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; So basically a stimulus may that be person, object, or an action will unconsciously affect one's response and or behavior without one's knowledge. In a study they subliminally exposed one of the participants with an African American face or a Caucasian face before the participants engaged in a verbal game.&lt;ref name="Chen + Bargh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Mark|author2=John Bargh|title=Nonconscious Behavioral Confirmation Processes: The Self-Fulfilling Consequences of Automatic Stereotype Activation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2 January 1997|doi=10.1006/jesp.1997.1329|volume=33|pages=541–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that when participants were subliminally exposed to the African American faces they were significantly more aggressive in the verbal game than those exposed to the Caucasian face.&lt;ref name="Chen + Bargh" /&gt; In a study related to this the participants were required to play a video game that depicted a real-life situation that involved deciding to shoot a man with a gun. Participants were shown pictures of both Caucasian and African American men with or without a gun or another object in hand. The participants had to respond "Shoot" or "Not Shoot" within milliseconds. The results were that participants significantly decided to shoot faster when African Americans had a gun versus Caucasians.&lt;ref name=Correll&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|author2=Charles M. Judd |author3=Bernd Wittenbrink |title=The Police Officer's Dilemma: Using Ethnicity to Disambiguate Potentially Threatening Individuals|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2002|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|volume=83|pages=1314–1329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postconscious automaticity depends on recent conscious experience for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; This postconscious influence on processing can be defined as the non-conscious consequences of conscious thought.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; The conscious experience may be intentional, or it may be unintentional, what is important is that the material be in awareness.&lt;ref name=Bargh /&gt; Most things we are aware of are driven by the environment, and one does not intend or control the flood of these [[perceptual]] experiences, yet they still result in postconscious effects. In other words, we need to consciously engage in something and depending on the experience we will unconsciously think, and or behave a certain way. In the classic [[Bobo doll experiment]] a child watches a video of an adult acting aggressive towards a Bobo doll. Later when the child is put in the room with that same doll, the child was more likely to also engage in that act, versus children who didn't watch the video. In a study participants were [[priming (psychology)|primed]] with the stereotype of professors by being told to imagine a typical professor for 5&amp;nbsp;min and to list (a conscious act) the behaviors, lifestyle, and appearance attributes of this typical professor.&lt;ref name=DJJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijksterhuis|first=AP|author2=Ad van Knippenberg|title=The Relation Between Perception and Behavior, or How to Win a Game of Trivial Pursuit|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|location=University of Nijmegen|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.865|volume=74|pages=865–877|pmid=9569649}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they were primed they had to perform a general knowledge task. The results were that the participants in the professor condition outperformed those in the control conditions (those not primed at all).&lt;ref name=DJJ /&gt;

Goal-dependent automaticity concerns skill and thought processes that require a goal to engage in them. This process is much similar to postconscious in that it requires conscious awareness to be initiated, but after that it can be guided outside of awareness by the [[unconscious mind]]. A good example would be driving a car: in order to drive a car, one needs to consciously have a goal to drive somewhere. When engaged in driving (only with enough practice) one can almost operate the car almost entirely without conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt; However, more attentional control and decision making are needed when introduced to novel (reference) situations like driving through an unfamiliar town. The process needs to be learned enough that it can be automatic, requiring little conscious thought as to how to do it.

===Controlled processes===
One definition of a controlled process is an intentionally-initiated sequence of cognitive activities.&lt;ref name=Scneider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Shiffrin|title=Controlled Automatic Human Information Processing|year=1977|issue=I. Detection, Search, and Attention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when attention is required for a task, we are consciously aware and in control. Controlled processes require us to think about situations, evaluate and make decisions. An example would be reading this article. We are required to read and understand the concepts of these processes and it takes effort to think conceptually. Controlled processes are thought to be slower, since by definition they require effortful control; therefore, they generally cannot be conducted simultaneously with other controlled processes without task-switching or impaired performance. So the drawback of controlled processes is that humans are thought to have a [[Cognitive load|limited capacity]] for overtly controlling behavior. Being tightly capacity-limited, controlled processing imposes considerable limitations on speed and the ability to [[Human multitasking|multitask]]. In a study, participants were randomly assigned into two conditions, one requiring one task (small cognitive load) and one requiring two tasks (heavy cognitive load). In the one-task condition, participants were told that they would hear an anti- or pro-abortion speech and would have to diagnose the speaker's attitude toward abortion. The two-task condition had the same first assignment, but they were required to switch spots with the speaker and take their place after that. Even after being specifically told that they would be given further instructions at the next step, their cognitive load was affected in this study. Participants in the two-task condition performed more poorly than the one-task condition simply because they had the next task on their mind (they had extra cognitive load). Basically, the more tasks someone tries to manage at the same time, the more their performance will suffer.

===Processes with ambiguous categorization===
Some cognitive processes are difficult to categorize as distinctly automatic or controlled, either because they contain components of both types of process or because the phenomena are difficult to define or observe. An example of the former is driving a car. An example of the latter is [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].

===Flow===
{{main|Flow (psychology)}}
Flow has been described as involving highly focused attention on the task at hand, loss of self-consciousness, and distorted time [[perception]], among other cognitive characteristics. Some people report that during flow states they are less aware of [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] responses such as hunger, fatigue, and discomfort. Some researchers hypothesize that because of this, some challenging tasks can counterintuitively require less effort to perform.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt;

Flow has been difficult to study, however, because it is difficult to produce in a controlled laboratory setting. Most experiments have relied heavily on correlating the presence of flow with various attributes of the task and the subjects' reported experiences. Of those correlations, subjects experiencing flow generally report that they perceive a good match between the task requirements and their skills (e.g. a professional basketball player in a professional basketball game.) Task structure and the clarity of the goal of the task are also thought to be related to when flow occurs.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt; All of these aspects of flow imply that there must be an opportunity to suppress other controlled processes, as well as inhibit certain types of automatic processes.

A study involving [[video game]] performance showed that flow in participants (determined based on a self-report survey of flow characteristics) strongly correlated with performance in the game. A related study attempted to inhibit and induce flow by biasing the moods of participants. The experimenters found that flow could be inhibited by a negative mood, but could not be induced by a positive mood.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt;

"A person does not need to be told to pay attention to a stimulus that captures attention quickly and effortlessly.&lt;ref name=Scneider /&gt; In many cases, explicitly directing one's own or another's attention is necessary due to the presence of another stimulus that more easily captures attention. In the case of flow, however, an action that would normally grab one's attention is ignored, and many automatic processes are either suppressed (such as stimulus-driven attention changes) or ignored (such as discomfort.)

On the other hand, situations in which autonomy is encroached upon (for example, if the individual must always control his/her actions to abide by rules imposed by the task) are thought to inhibit flow.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;Moller, A. C., Meier, B. P., &amp; Wall, R. D. 2010. Developing an experimental induction of flow: Effortless action in the lab. In B. Bruya (Ed.), Effortless attention: A new perspective in the cognitive science of attention and action (pp. 191–204). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that another requirement of flow is to be free from constraints that force controlled processes to be used. Additionally, several areas of research indicate that during a state of flow an otherwise-controlled process becomes automatic allowing it to behave dominant over all other automatic processes.

The '''Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|d}}), often referred to as the '''Broad Institute''', is a biomedical and [[genomic]] research center located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The institute is independently governed and supported as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Report for BROAD INSTITUTE INC.|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/26-3428781/broad-institute.aspx|website=GuideStar.org|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute-MIT &amp; Harvard|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmn4bcl/broad-institute-mit-harvard|publisher=Manta Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is partners with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], and the five Harvard [[teaching hospitals]].

== History ==

The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Broad Institute created: Links Harvard, M.I.T., and others in interdisciplinary initiative in genomics and medicine
|url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/07.17/11-broad.html
|publisher = Harvard Gazette
|date = 2003-07-17
|accessdate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of [[Whitehead Institute]] at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the [[Human Genome Project]]. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002–2003 among philanthropists [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edythe Broad]], MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]).

The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Facilities ==

The Broad Institute's facilities at 320 Charles Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], house one of the largest genome [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] centers in the world. As [[WICGR]] (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the [[Human Genome Project]].

In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broad.mit.edu/info/visiting.html|title=Contact - Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seven-story {{convert|231000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Pearle|title=Broad plans extension in Cambridge Center|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N9/broad.html|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square-foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge’s [[Kendall Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute celebrates opening of new building|url=https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/5748|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new facility has 15 floors, 11 of which are occupied, and has [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] gold certification. As of July 2014, it has around 800 occupants.

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015). Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships. LID Publishing Inc. {{ISBN|9780986079337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''.

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017).

''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ansel Adams and camera.jpg|thumb|Ansel Easton Adams (1902–1984), an American [[photographer]] and [[environmentalist]], photo by [[J. Malcolm Greany]]]]

'''Conservation photography''' is the active use of the [[photographic process]] and its products, within the parameters of [[photojournalism]], to [[advocate]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] outcomes.

Conservation photography combines [[nature photography]] with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of [[documentary photography]] as an agent for protecting [[nature]] and improving the [[biosphere]] and [[natural environment]]. Conservation Photography furthers [[environmental conservation]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[habitat conservation]] or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action.

==History==
[[File:Carleton E. Watkins - Mt. Broderick, Nevada Fall - SFM.95.98 01 d02.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Carleton Watkins|Carleton E. Watkins]] (1829–1916) of Mt. Broderick and Nevada Fall (700 ft.) at Yosemite Valley in 1861]]
[[File:Ansel Adams-Half Dome, Apple Orchard, Yosemite.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Ansel Adams]] of Yosemite Half Dome, Apple Orchard, trees with snow on branches in April 1933]]
Photography has developed as a powerful medium to empower conservation. Photography has served this role since the 1860s, although not widely acknowledged as such.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example are the powerful images of [[Carleton Watkins]] which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1864 and [[William Henry Jackson]] and [[Ansel Adams]] who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park.

Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused [[environmental crisis]], recognizing that the global pattern of [[ecosystem]] degradation was not sustainable.

The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] by photographer [[Cristina Mittermeier]], during the 8th [[World Wilderness Congress]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. Prior to 2005 "conservation photography" was not widely recognized as a discipline.

==Definition==
[[File:Seashell vendor.jpeg|thumb|Photo of a vendor in Tanzania in 2000 selling to tourists [[threatened species]] [[seashell]]s which have been taken alive from the sea, killing the animal inside.]]

Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation.

According to the acclaimed photographer, [[Joel Sartore]], “the typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn’t mean there’s no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.”

The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change.

Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable:

*The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort.
*The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture.

Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people’s hearts and minds.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gp-esso.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[Esso]] /[[ExxonMobil in 2003]]]]

In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including [[internet activism]] and sometimes serve as [[Investigative journalism]] evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in [[protected area]]s, can be important as legal evidence against the activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8208">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Dispositio''' is the system used for the organization of arguments in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is [[Latin]], and can be translated as "organization" or "arrangement".

It is the second of five canons of classical rhetoric (the first being [[inventio]], and the remaining being [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing.

The first part of any rhetorical exercise was to discover the proper arguments to use, which was done under the formalized methods of ''inventio''. The next problem facing the orator or writer was to select various arguments and organize them into an effective discourse.

== Aristotle ==
[[Aristotle]] defined two essential parts of a discourse: the statement of the case and the proof of the case. For example, in a legal argument, a prosecutor must first declare the charges against the defendant and provide the relevant facts; then he must present the evidence that proves guilt. Aristotle allowed that in practice most discourse also requires an introduction and a conclusion.

== Latin rhetoric ==
Later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]] refined this organizational scheme even further, so that there were eventually six parts:
* the introduction, or ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''. The term exordium comes from the Latin term meaning "to urge forward." In the exordium, the speaker gives their main argument, and all the relevant information.
* the statement of the case, or ''narratio''. Quintilian explained that in the narratio "we shall for instance represent a person accused of theft as covetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of homicide as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities to these persons if we are defending them; further we must do the same with place, time and the like". 
* the outline of the major points in the argument, or ''divisio'' (sometimes known as ''partitio''). It has two functions: to name the issues in dispute and to list the arguments to be used in the order they will appear.
* the proof of the case, or ''confirmatio''. It confirms or validates the material given in the narratio and partitio.
* the refutation of possible opposing arguments, or ''confutatio''. If the rhetor anticipates that certain people in his audience may disagree with his speech, he must be prepared to refute the argument that could possibly be presented in opposition to his original speech.
* the conclusion, or ''peroratio''. Cicero taught that a rhetor can do three things in this step: sum up his arguments, cast anyone who disagrees with him in a negative light, and arouse sympathy for himself, his clients, or his case.

While this structure might appear to be highly rigid (and certainly some writers on the subject were overly pedantic), it was in practice a flexible model. Cicero and Quintilian, for example, encouraged writers to rearrange the structure when it strengthened their case: for instance, if the opposing arguments were known to be powerful, it might be better to place the refutation before the proof.

Within each major part, there were additional tactics that might be employed. For instance, a prosecutor might sum up his case with forceful repetition of his main points using a technique known as ''[[accumulatio]]''. The defense attorney in the same case might use a different approach in his summation.

Finally, ''dispositio'' was also seen as an iterative process, particularly in conjunction with ''[[inventio]]''. The very process of organizing arguments might lead to the need to discover and research new ones. An orator would refine his arguments and their organization until they were properly arranged. He would then proceed to those areas that we generally associate with rhetoric today&amp;mdash;the development of the style and delivery of the arguments.

===''Exordium''===
The ''exordium'' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɔr|d|i|ə|m}}; meaning "beginning" in [[Latin]]; from ''exordiri'', meaning "to begin") was the introductory portion of an oration. The term is Latin and the Greek equivalent was called the ''[[proem]]'' or ''prooimion''. 

In the ''exordium'', the orator lays out the purpose of the discourse. In doing this, they need to consider several things:

* What kind of cause is he presenting? For instance, is it an honorable cause (defense of a hero) or a dishonorable one (defense of a murderer)?
* Should a direct opening be favoured, or should the opening be more subtle and indirect? 
* In what manner ought the speaker to proceed (e.g., light-heartedly or seriously)?
* The speaker should introduce their own character or credentials, so as to make the audience predisposed to believing their arguments.
* If required, or possible, the speaker might also call into question the character or credentials of his opponent.
* Lastly, the speaker must avoid certain faults in the introduction. For example, this excerpt from the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' lists several faults:

:"In the Introduction of a cause we must make sure that our style is temperate and that the words are in current use, so that the discourse seems unprepared. An Introduction is faulty if it can be applied as well to a number of causes; that is called a banal Introduction. Again, an Introduction which the adversary can use no less well is faulty, and that is called a common Introduction. That Introduction, again, is faulty which the opponent can turn to his own use against you. And again that is faulty which has been composed in too laboured a style, or is too long; and that which does not appear to have grown out of the cause itself in such a way to have an intimate connection with the Statement of Facts; and, finally, that which fails to make the hearer well disposed or receptive or attentive." (''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', I. vii, 11, trans. Harry Caplan, Loeb Classical Library, 1954.)

In short, the ''exordium'' was the portion of the discourse in which the orator would prepare the audience to hear his arguments in a favorable frame of mind. "An exordium can serve different kinds of functions in the differing species of rhetoric, but in all of them some of the major themes of the coming discourse will be announced in advance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters and Homilies For Hellenized Christians Volume II|last=Witherington III|first=Ben|publisher=IVP Academic|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8308-2933-0|location=USA|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Peroratio''===
The ''peroratio'' ("peroration"), as the final part of a speech, had two main purposes in classical rhetoric: to remind the audience of the main points of the speech (''recapitulatio'') and to influence their emotions (''affectus'').  The role of the peroration was defined by Greek writers on rhetoric, who called it ''epilogos''; but it is most often associated with Roman orators, who made frequent use of emotional appeals.  A famous  example was the speech of [[Marcus Antonius Orator|Marcus Antonius]] in defence of [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Aquillius]], during which Antonius tore open the tunic of Aquillius to reveal his battle scars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'', [http://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/cic_web/de_or_2.htm  2.xlvii.194]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century B.C. it was common for two or more speakers to appear on each side in major court cases.  In such cases it was considered a mark of honour to be asked to deliver the peroration.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', [http://www.attalus.org/old/brutus3.html#190  190]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cardym.jpg |thumb|right|200px|Drama students performing on stage.]]
A '''drama school''', '''stage school''' or '''theatre school''' is an undergraduate and/or graduate [[school]] or [[academic department|department]] at a [[college]] or [[university]]; or a free-standing institution (such as the Drama section at the [[Juilliard School]]); which specializes in the pre-professional training in [[drama]] and [[theatre]] arts, such as [[acting]], [[technical theatre|design and technical theatre]], [[arts administration]], and related subjects. If the drama school is part of a degree-granting institution, undergraduates typically take a [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], or, occasionally, [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Design]].  Graduate students may take a [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Doctor of Arts]], [[Doctor of Fine Arts]], or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.

==Entry and application process==
[[File:Dramaclubssst.jpg|thumb|Romanian students (Drama Club Botosani) in "The Taming of the Shrew"]]
Entry to drama school is usually through a competitive [[audition]] process. Some schools make this a two-stage process. Places on an acting course are limited (usually well below 100) so those who fare best at the audition are selected. Most academies state that applicants must be over 18 years of age.
Auditions usually involve the performance of [[monologue]]s and group workshops, and may also include a [[singing]] activity. This varies from academy to academy. If this is the case for an [[acting]] degree, the school looks more at how an applicant can put character into the song rather than how well they can sing. For a [[musical theatre]] degree, the emphasis is on showing one's talent as a [[singer]]. Most colleges offer callback auditions, often in several stages, in which students being considered for entry onto a course are brought back to audition again, demonstrating their talents further. It is also possible to get into a drama school by previous grades. Some auditioners may be under 18.

==Course content==

The courses offered by drama schools focus on practical courses, rather than theoretical classes. Their aim is to train students as professional [[actor]]s for stage (theatre or musical theatre) and camera-based work (film and television shows). Students are required to be enthusiastic and motivated in order to meet the demands of the program. At the beginning of the final year (usually the third), most drama schools stage a series of performances throughout the academic year to which [[Talent agent|agents]] and [[casting director]]s are invited. This helps to build the future of the graduates and serves as a showcase of what the students can do.

==Funding==

===United Kingdom===
In 1833 the actress [[Frances Maria Kelly]] managed the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] where she funded and operated a dramatic school, the earliest record of a drama school in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burwick|first1=Frederick|title=British Drama of the Industrial Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Conference of Drama Schools]] comprises Britain’s 22 leading Drama Schools. CDS exists in order to strengthen the voice of the member schools, to set and maintain the highest standards of training within the vocational drama sector, and to make it easier for prospective students to understand the range of courses on offer and the application process. Founded in 1969, the 22 member schools offer courses in Acting, Musical Theatre, Directing and Technical Theatre training. Graduates of CDS courses are currently working on stage, in front of the camera and behind the scenes in theatres and studios across Britain. In September 2016, Midlands Academy of Musical Theatre opened in Birmingham. Offering West End quality training in Musical Theatre to students aged 18+, and with the same or better opportunities as many London drama schools, they offer a regional option for prospective drama school students. In 2012 it was merged with the [[National Council for Drama Training]] to create a single national authority [[Drama UK]] responsible for both the provision of Drama Training and accreditation of official courses. In 2017 Drama UK was replaced by the [[Federation of Drama Schools]].

In the UK, funding varies from drama school to drama school. Historically drama schools were not part of the mainstream academic system, and therefore were not funded on the same basis as universities. Some drama schools are now part of a university, such as [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]], which is part of the [[City University of London]], and Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance, which is part of the University of Manchester, and these tend to charge similar tuition fees to universities. Student loans, drama awards and scholarships may help to provide students with their funding.
The most prominent funding scheme for performing arts education in the UK are the [[Dance and Drama Awards]].  This is a government scheme which subsidises the training offered at a selection of the leading performing arts schools in the fields of dance, drama, musical theatre and stage management.

===Ireland===

A number of third level institutions provide courses in Drama and Theatre Studies, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from TCD [http://www.tcd.ie/drama-film-music/ Drama Dept, TCD]&lt;/ref&gt; NUI Maynooth,&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from NUIM English Dept [http://english.nuim.ie/madtherapy.shtml Dramatherapy Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin City University.  A decision by Trinity in Jan 2007 to drop its BA in Acting Studies for cost reasons met with disappointment from the theatre sector.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity News report http://www.trinitynews.ie/articles.php?tn=1&amp;issue=2&amp;id=215{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  website&lt;/ref&gt;  A Forum for Acting Training was convened with leading professionals from the industry who recommended in a report published 27 May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Acting Training Report, May 2008, [http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/pdf/forum-on-acting-training-report.pdf Forum Report]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an Academy for Dramatic Arts, independent of a University, but with third level accreditation should be created. The report was submitted to the Irish Government.  On 1 August 2008, [[The Irish Times]] reported that a [[RADA]] graduate, [[Danielle Ryan]], granddaughter of the late [[Tony Ryan]] who founded [[Ryanair]], had announced plans to develop an Irish Academy of Dramatic Arts part-funded from a Trust created by her late father, Captain Cathal Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Smyth, Irish Times, 1 August 2008 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0801/1217368811614.html Acting academy to include theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan went ahead and the academy, known as The Lir, opened in September 2011. The Lir is part of Trinity College and is situated in the Grand Canal Dock area. It is officially associated with [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art |RADA]].

'''Ephraim Avigdor Speiser''' (January 24, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 15, 1965) was a [[Jewish]] [[Poland|Polish]]-born American [[Assyriologist]]. He discovered the ancient site of [[Tepe Gawra]] in 1927 and supervised its excavation between 1931 and 1938.

==Pre-war career==
He was born in [[Skalat]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], (then in Austrian Poland, now Ukraine) and went to school in [[Lwow]]. In 1920, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, eventually becoming a US citizen in 1926.
He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], from which he received his M.A. in 1923, before earning his Ph.D. from [[Dropsie College]] in Philadelphia in 1924.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/speiser_ea.html University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center]&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1924 to 1926 he was Harrison Research Fellow in Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=cdli&gt;[http://cdliwiki.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/doku.php/speiser_ephraim_avigdor Speiser, Ephraim Avigdor]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, UCLA Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Speiser won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study remains of the ancient [[Mitanni]] and [[Hurrians]] in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. While there in 1927 he discovered the [[Tepe Gawra]] (or "Great Mound"), one of the world's earliest cradles of civilization. In 1928 he was appointed assistant professor of Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania, and full professor in 1931.
He was field director of the Joint Excavation of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research|ASOR]] and the University Museum, 1930–1932, 1936–1937, undertaking excavations in [[Tepe Gawra]] and Tell Billa.  He also translated the [[Hurrian]] legal texts found at [[Nuzi]].

During [[World War II]], Speiser left academia to become chief of the [[Office of Strategic Services]]' Near East Section of the Research and Analysis Branch in Washington. He established a long tradition of American students and scholars of Orientalistik entering and serving in the intelligence services.

==Post-war==
After the war he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Chairman of the Department of Oriental Studies from 1947 until his death in 1965. He was also appointed Ellis Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages and Literatures there in 1954.

He translated and wrote extensive commentary for the volume on [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]] in the [[Anchor Bible Series]] and was one of the editors of the [[Torah]] in the [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] of the [[Old Testament]].

A noted student of his, (future professor) [[Moshe Greenberg]], became an [[Israel Prize]] laureate in Bible studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">[[File:Lossow4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Facesitting, [[Heinrich Lossow]] (1840–1897).]]
'''Facesitting''', also known as '''queening''' or '''kinging''', is a [[sexual practice]] in which one partner sits on or over the other's face, typically to allow or force [[oral sex|oral–genital]] or [[anilingus|oral–anal]] contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Yvonne K. Fulbright|Fulbright]] | first = Yvonne | title = The Best Oral Sex Ever - His Guide to Going down | publisher = Adams Media | location = Holbrook | year = 2011 | isbn = 1-4405-1080-6 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Thomas | title = The Language of Sadomasochism | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-313-26481-3 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to oral-genital and oral-anal contact, the position also leaves the bottom partner's hands free to stimulate other [[erogenous zones]] (e.g., anus, nipples, etc.).  The top partner may be facing either direction in this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Want to Taste You: Girl to Girl Talk|author=Zoe Jasmine|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for this position to form part of [[BDSM]], involving [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance and submission]], though this need not be the case. Within a BDSM or D/s context, facesitting can be a form of [[erotic humiliation]].

Facesitting is common among [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] and [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] individuals, for demonstrating superiority and for [[sexual gratification]]. Unlike [[erotic asphyxiation|smothering]], in facesitting the bottom partner is not deprived of [[Breathing|air]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The full-weight body-pressure, [[moisture]], [[body odor]]s, and [[darkness]] can be perceived as powerful [[sexual attractions]] or compulsions. The person sat upon may be in [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], sexually [[submissive]], or simply held down by the body-weight of the other person. In some cases, the submissive will consume the dominant's bodily waste(s) ([[urolagnia]] and [[coprophilia]]).

== Furniture ==
[[File:Queening-Stool.jpg|thumb|Face sitting using a Queening Stool. ]]
Sometimes special furniture is used, such as a "queening stool" or "smotherbox".&lt;ref name="Kink"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|author=Eva Christina|isbn=0399536949|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=465|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|author=Michael Makai|isbn=1492775975|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''queening stool'' is a low seat which fits over the [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]]'s face and contains an opening to allow oral-genital and/or oral-anal stimulation of the [[Dominatrix|domme]] while seated. 

The position allows the [[pelvic floor muscles]] (PFM) to relax and therefore partly exposing the [[labia minora]] to intimate touch. The [[gluteus maximus]] and [[levator ani]] muscles, the major muscles of the crotch, can relax and sag allowing easy access to the vagina and anus. Additionally, the stool allows for greater comfort and allows for the activity to be done for a longer period of time. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmv7lhiPpDo&lt;/ref&gt;

A smotherbox (or "smothering box") is a special form of queening stool which also allows the person under the seat to be locked in place, restrained by the [[neck]] as in a set of [[stocks]].&lt;ref name="Kink" /&gt; A smotherbox has two openings. One is in a vertical side of the box for the [[neck]] of the person who has his or her head inside the smotherbox. The other is in the top of the box to expose his or her face. The inside of a smotherbox is often padded to provide support for his or her neck and prevent his or her head from moving. The padding may also muffle noises from the outside, causing a relaxation effect and heightening his or her other senses. Smotherboxes are usually custom made pieces of furniture that may have a special significance for their users. They are sometimes made out of precious woods, with leather used for the seat.

[[File:Smotherbox rendition.jpg|thumb|upright|Different smotherbox designs]]
The smotherbox is placed on a stable surface. The cover (top half of the smotherbox) is open while the submissive lies down on his or her back and places his or her head in the box. When he or she is in position the cover is closed. The cover can have [[hinge]]s or be a separate part. Locks may be used to emphasize the submissive position or the submissive's hands may be fastened above his or her head to the box. Smotherboxes may be more permanently mounted to tables or other stable objects, and the submissive restrained to that surface instead. A Queening Chair or Facesitting Throne is another variation that is popular, designed to emphasize the relative place of the domme and submissive. They can be elegant and more formal than the smotherbox.

==In popular culture of the United Kingdom==
[[File:Michael von Zichy-Liebe,1911-3.jpg|thumb|[[Mihály Zichy]]: ''Making love'' (1911)]]
In 1980, [[Monty Python]] recorded a humorous song, "[[Sit on My Face]]", about the pleasures of facesitting. Written by [[Eric Idle]], the song's lyrics are sung to the [[melody]] of "[[Sing As We Go]]" by [[Gracie Fields]]. The opening gives way to multiple male voices singing "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me." The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]], such as "when I'm between your thighs you blow me away" and "life can be fine if we both [[69 (sex position)|69]]".

In 2014, the British government announced a ban on the production of [[hardcore pornography]] for the Internet. Ostensibly, the bill sought to protect women from sex acts that were violent or unsafe, and banned a wide variety of sex practices, including facesitting, strangulation and fisting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-backs-face-sitting-protesters-over-uk-porn-ban-9925991.html|title=Nick Clegg backs face-sitting protesters|author=Andrew Grice|date=15 December 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/europe/uk-porn-protest/|title='Face-sitting' protest over UK porn censorship law - CNN.com|author=Laura Smith-Spark, CNN|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law impacts only the production of pornographic videos as opposed to acts performed privately.

'''Gary Russell Libby''' (born June 7, 1944) is an American art historian, author, educator and former museum director known for his books and scholarly exhibitions in the visual arts and his work on the history and development of the Florida School of Art.

== Early life and education ==

Libby was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the second of three sons to Sylvia Phillips Libby of Boston and Charles Willard Libby of [[Machias, Maine]]. After graduation from [[Fort Myers Senior High School]], [[Ft. Myers, Florida]], he attended the [[University of Florida]] where he received an Associate of Arts, Bachelor and  Masters of Arts degrees in English Literature. Libby was awarded a post-graduate National Defense Education Act Fellowship to attend [[Tulane University]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he was accepted into the Doctoral Program with an interest in turn of the century art and literature journals published in England such as the Savoy and the Yellow Book.

== Career ==
[[File:Gary Russell Libby at dedication of the Gary R. Libby Gallery located in the UF School of Art and Art History.jpg|thumb|Gary Russell Libby in the Gary R. Libby Gallery]]At [[Stetson University]], [[DeLand, Florida]], Libby developed the curriculum for a number of upper division interdisciplinary courses for a new major in the arts and humanities. He also worked with Fred Messersmith  AWS, chairman of the Department of Art, in developing a series of exhibitions that explored the careers of artists from the United States and abroad who painted in [[Florida]] from post-Civil War to [[World War I]].  While at Stetson, Libby published a number of articles in academic journals including the Italian Quarterly and Paideuma.

He also began his study of Cuban historic artists in the Fulgencio Batista Collection of Cuban art housed at the Cuban Foundation Museum, [[Museum of Arts and Sciences (Daytona Beach)|Museum of Arts and Sciences]], [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. Libby’s “Artistic Taste in Pre-Castro Cuba “ was one of the lead papers presented  at the Southeastern Museum Conference, Charleston, South Carolina, 1975. That paper became the foundation of two books Libby authored. (''Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959'', a soft cover bi-lingual catalog, published by the Ringling Museum of Art, with essays interpreting works of art from the Batista Collection exhibition, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;See Archives John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Libby curated the exhibition at the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]], [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]], with additional works from the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]; [[The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[New York City|New York]], and the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America, [[Washington, DC]]. ''Cuba-A History in Art'', University Press of Florida, 1997, revised edition 2015.)

At [[Stetson University]], Libby served as Secretary of the Faculty Senate and acting University Art Archivist. In 1975, he was elected as a Trustee at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]], and became a Charter Member of the International Society of Fine Art Appraisers, Ltd.

In 1977, Libby was hired as the Executive Director of the Museum of Arts and Sciences which became accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and a Smithsonian Affiliate under Libby’s leadership. The Museum grew from one location of 7,000 sq. ft. to 120,000 sq. ft. with three different locations. Libby was also selected for and completed one of the first classes of the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum Leadership and Management Certification Program directed by Jane Glaser. At the Museum, Libby organized and led the first international museum travel program in [[Florida]]. This annual program introduced cultural treasures in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Scandinavia]], North and Equatorial [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] to thousands of central Floridians who attended these interpreted educational and cultural expeditions.  At his 2002 retirement, the Trustees of the Museum of Arts and Sciences named Libby as the first Director Emeritus and named the Lobby of the Museum as the “Gary R. Libby Entry Court.” A Trustee-led community-wide effort also raised nearly one million dollars to endow the Gary R. Libby Curator of Art position at the Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Libby continues to teach and lecture at Stetson University as a Visiting Professor /Guest Curator and also guest lectures for the Honors College at the [[University of Florida]] as Adjunct Lecturer.

'''The Gatty Marine Laboratory''' is a science facility located in the coastal town of [[St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]. It is part of the [[University of St Andrews]] and home to the [[Scottish Oceans Institute]], an interdisciplinary research institute studying the marine environment, specifically the [[behaviour]], [[ecology]], [[physiology]], [[population biology]] and [[functional genomics]] of marine organisms. The Gatty Marine Laboratory is known as the place where [[Richard G. Morris]] developed the [[Morris water navigation task]] in the early 1980s. 

==History==
The laboratory was paid for by the zoologist [[Charles Henry Gatty]] FRS FRSE FLS FGS (1836-1903) during his later life (1892), having to family to leave his fortune to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid both for an original timber building (1892)and its permanent stone replacement (1896). Its first Director was [[William Carmichael McIntosh]] [[FRSE]]. The permanent building was officially opened on 3 October 1896 by Lord Reay, at which point the timber building was abandoned. The building was badly damaged by fire in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.felbridge.org.uk/index.php/publications/charles-henry-gatty/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gatty Marine Laboratory has been continuously occupied except for the period between 1931 and the end of [[World War II]]. The laboratory has its origins in the government-funded St Andrews Fisheries Laboratory, which was founded in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=438 Scottish Oceans Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The first director, Professor [[William Carmichael McIntosh]] FRS, conducted pioneering work on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[annelids]] and the early life histories of marine fish over more than 50 years. In 1945-46 the Gatty received an operating budget of £50 and was used as a field station by zoologists and botanists based in the [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine|Bute Medical Building]] in the town centre.

From 1969 to 1985 the laboratory was under the Directorship of Prof [[Michael Laverack]].&lt;ref&gt;Independent (newspaper) obituary of M Laverack, 29 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, the "Gatty" (as it is informally known) has been a component Research Institute of the School of Biology (although the name and composition of the School has changed several times). The laboratory built up strong research groupings in fish biology and marine ecology and by the early 1990s received the highest number of research grants in marine biology of any UK department. In 1997, a major £4.3 million extension to the building was financed by the University Court. The new building provided a modern lecture theatre and teaching laboratory, and research laboratories for immunological and muscle research. The major part of the new build was occupied by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) sponsored [[Sea Mammal Research Unit]], which transferred to the site from Cambridge in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/site_docs/GattyHistory.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233232/http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/site_docs/GattyHistory.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} History of the Gatty Marine Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God, A Guide for the Perplexed''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Keith Ward]] arguing the compatibility between [[science]] and [[religion]]. 

In seven chapters [[Keith Ward]] takes the reader through the history of mankind's religious thought. He shows how philosophical questions have always been linked with religious questions, and how religion has never been merely a set of rules or doctrines, but a quest for meaning and a search for the blazing darkness that is God. Ward also discusses [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].  While the academic ground is covered lightly, the mystical, poetic and mysterious side of religion is also given due weight. The content is similar to, though the tone adopted is different from, [[Don Cupitt]]'s ''[[The Sea of Faith]]''.

'''Goodwin Hon Liu''' (born October 19, 1970) is an [[United States|American]] lawyer, educator and an Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Before his appointment by [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]], Liu was Associate Dean and Professor of Law at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] (Boalt Hall).&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=4360 |title=Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles |publisher=[[UC Berkeley School of Law]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu has been recognized for his writing on [[constitutional law]], education policy, [[civil rights]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

On February 24, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Liu to fill a vacancy on the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref name=whgov_20100224&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-nominates-goodwin-liu-united-states-court-appeals-ninth-circuit-jud "President Obama Nominates Goodwin Liu for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Judge Robert N. Chatigny for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit"], whitehouse.gov (February 24, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; For more than a year, Liu's nomination languished, amid significant opposition from Republicans in the U.S. Senate.

Liu and his family moved to [[Clewiston, Florida]], shortly after his birth and then in 1977, they relocated to [[Sacramento, California]], where Liu graduated from [[Rio Americano High School]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in biology at [[Stanford University]]. While there he was active in student politics as a member of the People's Platform, serving on the Council of Presidents of the ASSU. He attended [[Oxford University]] on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and earned a [[Master of Philosophy|M. Phil]] in philosophy and physiology. Liu received his  [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=4360|title=Goodwin Liu - Berkeley Law - Faculty Profiles |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Goodwin Liu.png|thumb|Liu speaking]]
Liu initially worked as an appellate litigator at [[O'Melveny &amp; Myers]] in Washington. He later clerked for Judge [[David S. Tatel]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] and then for [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], where among other things, he contributed a draft to her dissent in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=96546&amp;tsp=1|title=Goodwin Liu had a hand in Bush v.

He is also a former Chair of the Board of Directors of the [[American Constitution Society]].&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

He is currently a professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was elected to the [[American Law Institute]] in May 2008 and was elected to the ALI Council in May 2013. He currently serves as the chair of the ALI's committee on the Young Scholars Medal. He serves on the boards of the [[National Women's Law Center]] and the [[Alliance for Excellent Education]].&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

===Professorship===
He took a job at [[Boalt Hall]] at the UC Berkeley, where he became Associate Dean and Professor of Law.&lt;ref name="law.berkeley.edu" /&gt; In 2009 Liu was awarded the UC Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

On February 24, 2010, President Obama nominated Liu to a new judgeship seat on the Ninth Circuit created by the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007; which became effective on January 21, 2009. His nomination was filibustered by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and expired with the [[sine die|sine die adjournment]] of the 111th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16914047 "Boalt dean Liu's nomination to federal appeals court appears dead -- for now"].&lt;/ref&gt; He was renominated to the same position on the first full day of the 112th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Kurtz |url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2011/01/round_2.php?ref=fpblg |title=Round 2 |publisher=Talking Points Memo |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez|first=Evan|title=Obama Tries Again on Judicial Nominees|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704405704576064313360354954?mod=googlenews_wsj|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2011 the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the floor of the Senate by a 10–8 vote.&lt;ref name="senate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov |title=Senate Judiciary Committee |publisher=Judiciary.senate.gov |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Liu's nomination was harshly criticized by Senate Republicans for allegedly failing to disclose 117 of his more controversial writings and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/06/republicans-slam-obama-nominee-omissions-record/ "Republicans Slam Obama Judicial Nominee Over 117 Omissions From Record"], FOX News, April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, Liu submitted the 117 requested items to the committee as a supplemental to the original questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ben | last=Pershing | title=Senate Democrats defend 9th Circuit Court nominee Liu against GOP criticism | date=April 7, 2010 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/07/AR2010040703034.html?hpid=moreheadlines | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee hearing had been postponed twice particularly due to Republican opposition to Liu's judicial qualifications and record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/91017-leahy-to-forge-ahead-with-liu-hearing-despite-gop-objections "Leahy to forge ahead with Liu hearing despite GOP objections"], ''The Hill'', April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu defended his writings as a scholar by saying that "there's a clear difference between what things people write as scholars and how one would approach the role of a judge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2010-06-15-diversity-lower-courts_N.htm|title=Obama's push for court diversity hits snag|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=Biskupic, Joan|date= 2010-06-15|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2010, a letter was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy by the seven committee Republicans to request a third postponement, which was subsequently rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Leahy won't delay hearing for appeals court pick criticism | date=April 7, 2010 | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j8bJNmgkNXos7jmYkKGzZWbuSe6QD9EUBSK80 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu was also criticized for lack of trial-level experience.

Liu's criticism of Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and especially his statement during [[Samuel Alito]]'s Supreme Court nomination "Judge Alito's record envisions an America where police may shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from running away with a stolen purse; where federal agents may point guns at ordinary citizens during a raid, even after no sign of resistance, where a black man may be sentenced to death by an all-white jury for killing a white man, absent [an] analysis showing discrimination, is not the America we know.

On May 17, 2011, Senator [[Harry Reid]] filed a [[cloture]] motion on Liu's nomination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/B?r112:@FIELD%28FLD003+s%29+@FIELD%28DDATE+20110517%29 |title=Congressional Record May 17, 2011, Senate, Items 17 &amp; 18 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2011, the Senate rejected cloture in a mostly party-line vote of 52–43, with all but one Democrat ([[Ben Nelson]]) voting in favor of cloture and all but one Republican ([[Lisa Murkowski]]) voting against.&lt;ref name="senate2" /&gt; He became the first Obama judicial nominee to be successfully filibustered in the Senate.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/05/19/senate-republicans-may-defeat-obama-pick-bench-uc-/ |title=Obama pick for bench blocked by GOP |author=Larry Margasak |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2011-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519231931/http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/05/19/senate-republicans-may-defeat-obama-pick-bench-uc-/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the makeup of the Senate unlikely to change until after the 2012 election, Liu withdrew his name from consideration on May 25, 2011.

He noted, however, that the problem with the confirmation process is that it has become transformed into requiring 60 votes as opposed to a bare majority, which was not part of the Constitutional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2PcG94Slbg|title=The Honorable Goodwin Liu 2.22.13|date= |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California Supreme Court ===
[[File:Goodwin Liu Confirmation.jpg|thumb|Justice Liu and his wife shaking hands with Governor [[Jerry Brown]] after his swearing-in ceremony.]]
On July 26, 2011, California Gov. [[Jerry Brown]] nominated Liu to a seat on the [[Supreme Court of California]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In submitting his nomination, Brown said that "[Liu] is a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and has experience in private practice, [in] government service and in the academic community. I know that he will be an outstanding addition to our state supreme court."&lt;ref name="Brownnominee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17139|title=Governor Brown Nominates Goodwin Liu for California Supreme Court|publisher=[[Governor of California]]|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu responded to his nomination with a prepared statement: "I'm deeply honored by Governor Brown's nomination and look forward to the opportunity to serve the people of California on our state's highest court."&lt;ref name="Brownnominee" /&gt;

On August 30, the state bar commission that screens all nominees gave Liu a "unanimously well qualified" rating, describing him as "brilliant, impartial, and with a work ethic second to none ... [h]e has an unwavering commitment to equal access to justice and will treat all litigants fairly, without regard to wealth or position in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/08/goodwin-lius-appointment-to-california-supreme-court-expected-to-be-confirmed.html|title=Goodwin Liu expected to be confirmed to California Supreme Court |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] blog |date=2011-08-30|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was confirmed unanimously the next day by Chief Justice [[Tani Cantil-Sakauye]], state Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]], and Presiding Justice Joan Dempsey-Klein, the senior-most presiding justice serving on the California Court of Appeal.

Liu was sworn in on September 1, 2011, and took the bench on September 6, sitting on a procedural issue regarding the controversial ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/goodwin-liu-finally-takes-the-bench/|title=Goodwin Liu Takes the Bench on California Supreme Court|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other justices employ five permanent staff as [[law clerk]]s, Justice Liu has returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks.&lt;ref name="LiuUCLA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justice Goodwin Liu|title=How the California Supreme Court Actually Works|journal=[[UCLA Law Review]]|date=2014|volume=61|page=1246|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/61-5-2.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinions====
In his first year on the bench, Liu authored six decisions, all of them unanimous.

*''Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc.''
*''Dicon Fiberoptics, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Board''
*''United Teachers of Los Angeles v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.''
*''Coito v. Superior Court''
*''National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn., Inc. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.''
*''Parks v. MBNA American Bank''

He also authored the majority opinion in ''Apple v. Superior Court'', where he ruled that online retailers can continue asking for credit card holder's information, such as telephone numbers and home addresses, when completing a transaction with a credit card. The complaint arose from the Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971, which sought to protect [[consumer privacy]] when purchasing products in a store. Liu instead ruled for Apple, concluding that "because we cannot make a square peg fit a round hole, we must conclude that online transactions involving electronically downloadable products fall outside the coverage of the statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202586978248|title=4-3 Ruling Backs Online Retailers Who Collect Cardholder Data|publisher=Law.com|date=February 4, 2013|author=Graham, Scott|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Justice Liu joined in the California Supreme Court's unauthored opinion, ''In re Hong Yen Chang'', which posthumously admitted Chang to the State Bar. Chang was denied admission to the bar by the court in 1890, due to the federal Chinese Exclusion Act. Justice Liu and the rest of the California Supreme Court abrogated the court's previous decision and held that "the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong" that "denied Chang equal protection of the laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S223736.PDF ''In re Hong Yen Chang''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603191226/http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S223736.PDF |date=2015-06-03 }} (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Liu leans socially liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Thomas D.|title=Column: Brown can put his stamp on California Supreme Court|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/07/01/thomas-d-elias-column-brown-can-put-his-stamp-on-california-supreme-court/|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written in favor of [[affirmative action]], abortion rights, and [[same-sex marriage]] and has been critical of [[Water-boarding#Contemporary use and the United States|Bush-era waterboarding policy]] and the [[death penalty]]. In a 2008 article for the ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'', Liu advocated a constitutional right to receive welfare.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rethinking+constitutional+welfare+rights.-a0194620614&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  His positions are predominantly left-leaning; however, Liu has supported charter schools and government-funded vouchers for private schools, particularly if used as a tool to "promote racial diversity."&lt;ref name="SFGate1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-14/news/18835339_1_nomination-of-samuel-alito-federal-appeals-court-goodwin-liu|title=Obama nominee Goodwin Liu an unassuming man|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=March 14, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Liu has defended the California Supreme Court's practice of drafting its opinions before hearing oral arguments.&lt;ref name="LiuUCLA" /&gt;

Gerald Uelman, a professor and former Dean of the [[University of Santa Clara]] School of Law, was impressed with Liu's work, saying "He displays a very independent streak. His opinions are very well thought out and well reasoned." Bob Egelko, a legal affairs reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', agreed, saying that "his dissents come within the ideological boundaries of [the California Supreme Court], which is an institution that in general moves incrementally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/09/08/5708024/court-watchers-view-california.html |title=Goodwin Liu isn't the left winger critics painted him to be |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |date=September 8, 2013 |author=Sward, Susan |accessdate=November 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221750/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/09/08/5708024/court-watchers-view-california.html |archivedate=December 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greywater treatment.jpg|thumb|Left: Greywater sample from an office building. Right: Same greywater after treatment in [[membrane bioreactor]]]]

'''Greywater''' ([[spelling differences|also spelled]] '''graywater''', '''grey water''' and '''gray water''') or '''sullage''' is all [[wastewater]] generated in households or office buildings from streams without fecal contamination, i.e. all streams except for the wastewater from toilets. Sources of greywater include, [[sinks]], [[shower]]s, [[bathtub|baths]], clothes [[washing machines]] or dish washers. As greywater contains fewer [[pathogen]]s than domestic wastewater, it is generally safer to handle and easier to treat and reuse onsite for [[Flush toilet|toilet flushing]], landscape or crop [[irrigation]], and other non-potable uses.

The application of greywater reuse in [[Integrated urban water management|urban water system]]s provides substantial benefits for both the [[water supply]] subsystem by reducing the demand for fresh [[clean water]] as well as the wastewater subsystems by reducing the amount of wastewater required to be conveyed and treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems|last = Behzadian|first = k|date = 2015|journal = Science of the Total Environment|doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kapelan|first2 = Z|publisher = Elsevier|volume = 527–528|pages = 220–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treated greywater has many uses, for example toilet flushing or irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|title=NM State greywater advice|last=Duttle|first=Marsha|date=January 1990|publisher=[[New Mexico State University]]|accessdate=23 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213002120/http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|archivedate=13 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Greywater - from house cleanings (2946418965).jpg|thumb|Example of a source of greywater in the household: dirty water from cleaning the floor]]
[[File:Greywater treatment garden (3212483147).jpg|thumb|Urban decentralized greywater treatment with [[constructed wetland]] in [[Oslo]]]]
[[File:Greywater treatment plant (5729648031).jpg|thumb|Greywater treatment plant with [[membrane bioreactor]] in the basement of an office building in [[Frankfurt]]]]

===Definition===

Greywater is all [[wastewater]] that is generated in household or office building sources without [[fecal]] contamination. Therefore, by definition, greywater does not include the discharge of toilets or highly fecally contaminated wastewater, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and contains [[human waste]].

=== Quality ===
Greywater usually contains some traces of [[excreta]] and is therefore not free of pathogens.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; The excreta comes from washing a person's anal area in the bath and shower, or from the laundry (washing underwear and nappies). The quality of greywater can deteriorate rapidly during storage because it often is warm and contains some nutrients and organic matter (e.g. dead skin cells), as well as pathogens. Stored greywater also leads to odour nuisances for the same reason.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Quantity ===
In households with conventional flush toilets, greywater makes up about 65% of the total wastewater produced by that household.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; It may be a good source of water for reuse, because there is a close relationship between the production of greywater and the potential demand for toilet flushing water.

===Practical aspects===

Misconnections of pipes can cause greywater tanks to contain a percentage of blackwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolksdorf|first=J.|last2=Cornel|first2=P.|date=2017-05-19|title=Separating grey- and blackwater in urban water cycles – sensible in the view of misconnections?|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|pages=wst2017293|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.293|issn=0273-1223|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194343/http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=|volume=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small traces of [[human feces|feces]] that enter the greywater stream via [[effluent]] from the shower, sink, or washing machine do not pose practical hazards under normal conditions, as long as the greywater is used correctly (for example, percolated from a [[dry well]] or used correctly in farming irrigation).

==Treatment processes==

{{Further|Sewage treatment plant| Reclaimed water}}

The separate treatment of greywater falls under the concept of [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] which is one principle commonly applied in [[ecological sanitation]] approaches. The main advantage of keeping greywater separate from toilet wastewater is that the pathogen load is much reduced and the greywater is therefore easier to treat and reuse.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-3-906484-57-0 |url=http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |last1=Tilley |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ulrich |first2=Lukas |last3=Lüthi |first3=Christoph |last4=Reymond |first4=Philippe |last5=Zurbrügg |first5=Chris |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132303024500/http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |archivedate=2017-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When greywater is mixed with toilet wastewater, it is called sewage or [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and should be treated in [[sewage treatment]] plants or onsite sewage facility, which often is a septic system. When it is kept separate, it may open up interesting decentralized treatment and reuse options.

Greywater from kitchen sinks contains [[fat]]s, [[oil]]s and [[Yellow grease|grease]] and high loads of organic matter. It should undergo preliminary treatment to remove these substances before discharge into a grey water tank. If this is difficult to apply, it could be directed to the blackwater system or to an existing [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/~/media/Publications/891%204.pdf |title=Code of practice – on-site wastewater management, EPA-Victoria, Au, Publication 891 4-1|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most greywater is easier to treat and recycle than blackwater (sewage), because of lower levels of contaminants. If collected using a separate plumbing system from blackwater, domestic greywater can be [[water recycling|recycled]] directly within the home, garden or company and used either immediately or processed and stored. If stored, it must be used within a very short time or it will begin to putrefy due to the organic solids in the water. Recycled greywater of this kind is never [[potable|safe to drink]], but a number of treatment steps can be used to provide water for washing or flushing toilets.

The treatment processes that can be used are in principle the same as those used for sewage treatment, except that they are usually installed on a smaller scale (decentralized level), often at household or building level:
* Biological systems such as [[constructed wetland]]s or [[green wall|living walls]] and bioreactors or more compact systems such as [[membrane bioreactor]]s which are a variation of the [[activated sludge]] process and is also used to treat sewage.
* Mechanical systems ([[sand filter|sand filtration]], [[lava filter|lava filter systems]] and systems based on [[UV]] radiation)
In constructed wetlands, the plants use contaminants of greywater, such as food particles, as nutrients in their growth. However, salt and soap residues can be toxic to microbial and plant life alike, but can be absorbed and degraded through [[constructed wetlands]] and aquatic plants such as [[sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], and grasses.

==Reuse==
{{Further|Resource recovery|Integrated urban water management}}
The global water resources are worsening. According to a report from United Nations states that 2.7 billion people will face the problem of water shortage by 2025, which means almost 1/2-1/3 of the total population of the world will be affected by this problem. Reusing the [[wastewater]] has become a good way to solve this problem, and wastewater reuse is also called recycled or [[reclaimed water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Juan |first=Yi-Kai|last2=Chen|first2=Yi|last3=Lin|first3=Jing-Ming|date=19 November 2016|title=Greywater Reuse System Design and Economic Analysis for Residential Buildings in Taiwan|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/546/htm|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Demand on conventional water supplies and pressure on sewage treatment systems is reduced by the use of greywater. Re-using greywater also reduces the volume of sewage effluent entering watercourses which can be ecologically beneficial. In times of drought, especially in urban areas, greywater use in gardens or toilet systems helps to achieve some of the goals of [[ecologically sustainable development]].

The potential ecological benefits of greywater recycling include

* Reduced freshwater extraction from rivers and [[aquifers]]
* Less impact from [[septic tank]] and [[water treatment plant|treatment plant]] infrastructure
* Reduced energy use and chemical pollution from treatment
* [[Groundwater recharge]]
* Reclamation of nutrients
* Greater quality of [[surface water|surface]] and [[ground water]] when preserved by the natural purification in the top layers of soil than generated water treatment processes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html Lets Go Green Practical Alternatives to Sewer and Septic Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130042458/http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. Southwest]] and the Middle East where available water supplies are limited, especially in view of a rapidly growing population, a strong imperative exists for adoption of alternative water technologies.

The potential economic benefits of greywater recycling include

* Can reduce the demand for [[fresh water]], and when people reduce the use of fresh water, the cost of domestic water consumption is significantly reduced, while alleviating the pressure of global water resources.
* Can reduce the amount of wastewater entering the sewer or on-site treatment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainable.com.au/greywater-treatment.html|title=Sustainable Earth Technologies|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
Greywater use for irrigation appears to be a safe practice. A 2015 epidemiological study found no additional burden of disease among greywater users irrigating arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;Busgang A, Friedler E, Ovadia O, Gross A. Epidemiological study for the assessment of health risks associated with greywater reuse for irrigation in arid regions. Science of the Total Environment [serial online]. December 25, 2015;538:230-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of reuse of greywater as potable water has also been studied. A few organic micropollutants including benzene were found in greywater in significant concentrations but most pollutants were in very low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Etchepare R, van der Hoek J. Health risk assessment of organic micropollutants in greywater for potable reuse. Water Research [serial online]. April 2015;72:186-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Faecal contamination, peripheral pathogens (e.g., skin and mucous tissue), and food-derived pathogens are the three major sources of pathogens in greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maimon|first=Adi|last2=Friedler|first2=Eran|last3=Gross|first3=Amit|date=27 March 2014|title=Parameters affecting greywater quality and its safety for reuse|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714004859?via%3Dihub|access-date=28 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.133|volume=487|journal=Science of the Total Environment|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greywater reuse in toilet flushing and garden irrigation may produce [[aerosol]]s. These could transmit [[Legionella|legionella disease]] and bring a potential health risk for people. However, the result of the research shows that the health risk due to reuse of greywater either for garden irrigation or toilet flushing was not significantly higher than the risk associated with using clear water for the same activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanky|first=Marina|last2=Sharaby|first2=Yehonatan|last3=et al.|date=14 June 2017|title=Greywater reuse - Assessment of the health risk induced by Legionella pneumophila|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135417307212?via%3Dihub#sec3|access-date=28 November 2017|work=Sustainable Earth Technologies|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.068|volume=125|pages=410–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrigation===
Most greywater should be assumed to have some blackwater-type components, including [[pathogens]]. Greywater should be applied below the surface where possible (e.g., via drip line on top of the soil, under [[mulch]]; or in mulch-filled trenches) and not sprayed, as there is a danger of inhaling the water as an [[aerosol]].

In any greywater system, it is important to avoid toxic materials such as bleaches, [[bath salts]], artificial dyes, [[chlorine]]-based cleansers, strong [[acids]]/[[alkali]], [[solvents]], and products containing [[boron]], which is toxic to plants at high levels. Most cleaning agents contain [[sodium]] [[salts]], which can cause excessive soil [[alkalinity]], inhibit seed germination, and destroy the structure of soils by dispersing clay. Soils watered with greywater systems can be amended with [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]) to reduce [[pH]]. Cleaning products containing [[ammonia]] are safe to use, as plants can use it to obtain nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.umass.edu/landscape/fact-sheets/recycling-gray-water-home-gardens|title=Recycling Gray Water for Home Gardens|publisher=University of Massachusetts|author1=Dr. Allen V.

Some greywater may be applied directly from the sink to the garden or container field, receiving further treatment from [[soil microbes|soil life]] and plant roots.

The use of non-toxic and low-sodium soap and personal care products is recommended to protect vegetation when reusing greywater for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA.

Retrieved: 21 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor reuse===
Recycled greywater from showers and bathtubs can be used for flushing toilets in most European and Australian jurisdictions and in United States jurisdictions that have adopted the [[International Plumbing Code]].

Such a system could provide an estimated 30% reduction in water use for the average household. The danger of [[biological contamination]] is avoided by using:
* A cleaning tank, to eliminate floating and sinking items
* An intelligent control mechanism that flushes the collected water if it has been stored long enough to be hazardous; this completely avoids the problems of filtration and chemical treatment

Greywater recycling without treatment is used in certain [[dwellings]] for applications where potable water is not required (e.g., garden and land irrigation, [[toilet flushing]]). It may also be used in dwellings when the greywater (e.g., from [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater]]) is already fairly clean to begin with and/or has not been polluted with non-degradable chemicals such as non-natural soaps (thus using natural cleaning products instead). It is not recommended to use water that has been in the greywater filtration system for more than 24 hours as bacteria builds up, affecting the water that is being reused.

Due to the limited treatment technology, the treated greywater still contains some chemicals and bacteria, so some safety issues should be observed when using the treated greywater around the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/water/saving-water/articles/guide-to-greywater-systems| title=choice|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat reclamation===
Devices are currently available that capture heat from residential and industrial greywater, through a process called drainwater heat recovery, greywater heat recovery, or hot [[water heat recycling]].

Rather than flowing directly into a water heating device, incoming cold water flows first through a heat exchanger where it is pre-warmed by heat from greywater flowing out from such activities as dishwashing, or showering. Typical household devices receiving greywater from a shower can recover up to 60% of the heat that would otherwise go to waste.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Regulations==
=== United States ===
[[Government regulation]] governing domestic greywater use for landscape irrigation (diversion for reuse) is still a developing area and continues to gain wider support as the actual risks and benefits are considered and put into clearer perspective.

"Greywater" (by pure legal definition) is considered in some jurisdictions to be "sewage" (all wastewater including greywater and toilet waste), but in the U.S. states that adopt the ''International Plumbing Code'', it can be used for subsurface irrigation and for toilet flushing, and in states that adopt the ''[[Uniform Plumbing Code]]'', it can be used in underground disposal fields that are akin to shallow sewage disposal fields.

[[Wyoming]] allows surface and subsurface irrigation and other non-specific use of greywater under a Department of Environmental Quality policy enacted in March 2010. [[California]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]] and some other states allow true subsurface [[drip irrigation]] with greywater. Where greywater is still considered sewage, it is bound by the same regulatory procedures enacted to ensure properly engineered septic tank and effluent disposal systems are installed for long system life and to control spread of disease and pollution. In such regulatory jurisdictions, this has commonly meant domestic greywater diversion for landscape irrigation was either not permitted or was discouraged by expensive and complex sewage system approval requirements. Wider legitimate community greywater diversion for landscape irrigation has subsequently been handicapped and resulted in greywater reuse continuing to still be widely undertaken by householders outside of and in preference to the legal avenues.

However, with [[water conservation]] becoming a necessity in a growing number of jurisdictions, business, political and community pressure has made regulators seriously reconsider the actual risks against actual benefits.

It is now recognized and accepted by an increasing number of regulators{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that the microbiological risks of greywater reuse at the single dwelling level where inhabitants already had intimate knowledge of that greywater are in reality an insignificant risk, when properly managed without the need for onerous approval processes. This is reflected in the [[New South Wales]] Government Department of Water and Energy's newly released greywater diversion rules, and the recent passage of greywater legislation in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="montanalaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106092106/http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }} 2007 greywater legislation in Montana&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 Legislative Session, the state of Montana passed a bill expanding greywater use into multi-family and commercial buildings. The Department of Environmental Quality has already drafted rules and design guidelines for greywater re-use systems in all these applications. Existing staff would review systems proposed for new subdivisions in conjunction with review of all other wastewater system components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gray water law is a good step forward |newspaper= [[The Montana Standard]] |date= 2009-04-01 |url= http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160407021503/http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |archivedate= 2016-04-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict permit requirements in [[Austin, Texas]], led to issuance of only one residential graywater permit since 2010. A working group formed to streamline the permitting process, and in 2013, the city created new code that has eased the requirements, resulting in four more permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144253/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }} Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, a push has been made in recent years to address greywater in connection with the State's greenhouse gas reduction goals (see [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|AB 32]]). As a large amount of energy (electricity) is used for pumping, treating and transporting potable water within the state, water conservation has been identified as one of several ways California is seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;California Air Resources Board. AB 32 Scoping Plan. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the [[California Building Standards Commission]] (CBSC) approved the addition of Chapter 16A "Non-potable Water Reuse Systems" to the 2007 California Plumbing Code. Emergency regulations allowing greywater reuse systems were subsequently filed with the [[California Secretary of State]] August 2009 and became effective immediately upon filing. Assembly Bill 371 (Goldberg 2006) and Senate Bill 283 (DeSaulnier 2009) directed the [[California Department of Water Resources]] (DWR), in consultation with the State Department of Health Services, to adopt and submit to the CBSC regulations for a State version of Appendix J (renamed Chapter 16 Part 2) of the Uniform Plumbing Code to provide design standards to safely plumb buildings with both potable and recycled water systems. November 2009 the CBSC unanimously voted to approve the California Dual Plumbing Code that establishes statewide standards for potable and recycled water plumbing systems in commercial, retail and office buildings, theaters, auditoriums, condominiums, schools, hotels, apartments, barracks, dormitories, jails, prisons and reformatories. In addition, the [[California Department of Housing and Community Development]] has greywater standards and DWR has also proposed dual plumbing design standards.

In Arizona, greywater is defined as water with a BOD5 less than 380&amp;nbsp;mg/L, TSS&lt;430 and the Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) content should be less than 75&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The Arizona water has issued advice that people should avoid direct contact with grey water. Most greywater use is by underground [[drip irrigation]] since surface irrigation is not permitted.There are three types of use in Arizona: up to a quota of 400 gpd per family (close to 1500 L per day) no permission is required for greywater use, between 400 and 3000 gpd (1500 and 11,355 L per day, respectively) permission is required and above 3000 gpd (&gt;11,355 L per day) it is considered as conventional wastewater venture. 
Other limitations include restrictions on contact, restrictions on use on herbaceous food plants, exclusion of hazardous materials and effective separation from surface water run-off.

The Uniform Plumbing Code, adopted in some U.S. jurisdictions, prohibits greywater use indoors.

=== United Kingdom ===
Greywater recycling is relatively uncommon in the UK, largely because the financial cost and environmental impact of mains water is very low. Greywater systems should comply with BS8525 and the [[Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999|Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations]] in order to avoid risks to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030184123|title=BS 8525-1:2010 - Greywater systems.

Greywater from single sewered premises has the potential to be reused on site for ornamental, garden and lawn irrigation, toilet flushing. The reuse options include Horizontal flow reed bed (HFRB), Vertical flow reed bed (VFRB), Green roof water recycling system (GROW), Membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Membrane chemical reactor (MCR).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oron|first=Gideon|last2=Adel|first2=Mike|last3=Agmon|first3=Vered| last4=Frieder|first4=Eran|last5=Halperin|first5=Rami|last6=Leshem|first6=Ehud| last7=Weinberg|first7=Daniel|date= 14 March 2014|title= Greywater use in Israel and worldwide: Standards and prospects|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541400222X?via%3Dihub|access-date=30 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2014.03.032|volume=58|journal=Water Research|pages=92–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Although Canada is a water-rich country, the center of the country freezes in the winter and droughts happen some summers. There are locations where watering outdoors is restricted in the dry season, some water must be transported from an outside source, or on-site costs are high. At present, the standards for greywater reuse are not strict compared with other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The National Plumbing Code, which is adopted in whole or in part by the provinces, indicates that non-potable water systems should only be used to supply toilets and underground irrigation systems, collecting rainwater with roof gutters is included as a form of greywater.&lt;ref&gt;https://tapsbath.com/wp-content/uploads/Guide-Sustainable-Plumbing-CMHC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Health Canada has published a guideline to use greywater for toilet flushing and British Columbia's building code includes subsurface irrigation with greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/water-quality/household-reclaimed-water-water-quality.html|title=Household Reclaimed Water - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|website=www.canada.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/waste-management/sewage/onsite-sewerage-systems/what_is_grey_water.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta "wastewater from any source cannot be used inside buildings"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/1176|title=Municipal Affairs: Reclaimed Wastewater|first=Jessica|last=Spratt|website=www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saskatchewan also treats greywater as sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowma.ca/home-owners/faqs/|title=FAQs –  Saskatchewan Onsite Wastewater Management Association|website=www.sowma.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Household greywater from a single contaminated site may be reused on-site at the ornamental garden and lawn watering, toilet flushing and laundry uses, depending on the type of greywater and treatment level. Some people wisely re-use the gross weight, but others use it even worse (without any treatment), such as bathing in the bath or simply transferring laundry water to the lawn where children and pets may be exposed directly. The Department of Health and Community Services (DHCS) focuses on protecting public health and then takes action to control and minimize the public health risks associated with greywater reuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cyprus ===
The government of Cyprus has implemented four water-saving subsidies: drilling installations, drilling with lavatories, installation of hot water circulation systems and installation of greywater recycling systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jordan ===
The emphasis on the use of greywater in [[Jordan]] has two main purposes: water conservation and socio-economic aspects. The Amman Islamic Water Development and Management Network (INWRDAM) in Jordan promoted research on gray water reuse in Jordan. At present, greywater research in Jordan is funded mainly by the International Development Research Center (IDRC) in Ottawa, Canada, to install and use greywater systems based on the establishment of small wetland systems in private households. The cost of this system is about 500 US dollars per household.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:2008-08-22 White German Shepherd swimming in algae.jpg|thumb|A dog swimming through an algal bloom.]]

A '''harmful algal bloom''' ('''HAB''') are organisms that can severely lower oxygen levels in natural waters, killing marine life.  Some HABs are associated with algae-produced toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eutrophication and harmful algal blooms: A scientific consensus|authors=J. Heisler, P.M. Glibert, J.M. Burkholder, D.M. Anderson, W. Cochlan, W.C. Dennison b, Q. Dortch, C.J. Gobler, C.A. Heil, E. Humphries, A. Lewitus, R. Magnien, H.G. Marshallm, K. Sellner, D.A. Stockwell, D.K. Stoecker, M. Suddleson|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=8|issue=1|year=2008|pages=3–13|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2008.08.006|pmid=28781587|pmc=5543702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blooms can last from a few days to many months. After the bloom dies, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more of the oxygen, which can create [[fish die-off]]s. When these zones of depleted oxygen cover a large area for an extended period of time, they are referred to as [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.
 
HABs are induced by an [[nutrient pollution|overabundance of nutrients]] in the water. The two most common nutrients are fixed nitrogen (nitrates, ammonia, urea) and phosphate.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/habs/general.html Harmful Algal Blooms], ''Center for Disease Control''&lt;/ref&gt;  These nutrients are emitted by [[Agricultural pollution|agriculture]], other industries, excessive [[fertilizer]] use in urban/suburban areas and associated [[urban runoff]]. Higher water temperature and low circulation are contributing factors. HABs can cause significant harm to animals, the environment and economies. They have been increasing in size and frequency worldwide, a fact that many experts attribute to global climate change. The U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) predicts more harmful blooms in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Chelsea |date=2016-09-29 |title=The Pacific blob caused an "unprecedented" toxic algal bloom — and there’s more to come |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/29/warm-oceans-caused-last-years-toxic-blob-and-more-algae-blooms-may-be-in-store |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and identification==
[[File:Banter See 1348.jpg|thumb|px240|Algae on the coast of northern Germany]]
HABs from [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) can appear as a foam, scum, or mat on or just below the surface of water and can take on various colors depending on their pigments.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes or rivers may appear bright green, often with surface streaks which looks like floating paint.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Similarly, red tides made up of dinoflagellates, also contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from green to brown to red.

Most blooms occur in warm waters that have excessive nutrients.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The harmful effects from such blooms is due to the toxins they produce or from using up oxygen in the water which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/07/algae-blooms-economy-west-coast-toxic-bloom/31222581/ "What you need to know about toxic algae blooms"], ''USA Today'', August 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all algal blooms are harmful, however, with some only discoloring water, producing a smelly odor, or adding a bad taste to the water. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell if a bloom is harmful from just appearances, since sampling and microscopic examination is required.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Blue-gree algae bloom Lake Erie.png|thumb|px240|Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) bloom on [[Lake Erie]] in 2009]]
There are three main types of algae which can form into harmful algal blooms: [[cyanobacteria]], [[dinoflagellates]] and [[diatoms]]. All three are made up of microscopic floating organisms which, like plants, can create their own food from sunlight by means of [[photosynthesis]]. That ability makes them an essential part of the [[food web]] for small fish and other organisms.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black, Jacquelyn G., and Black, Laura J. ''Microbiology: Principles and Explorations'', 8th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Cyanobacteria===
Harmful algal blooms in freshwater lakes and rivers, or at [[estuaries]], where rivers flow into the ocean, are caused by cyanobacteria, also known as "blue-green algae".&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;Peebles, Ernst B. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-us/why-toxic-algae-blooms-li_b_11082734.html "Why toxic algae blooms like Florida’s are so dangerous to people and wildlife"], ''Huffington Post'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; They can produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]],&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; a [[neurotoxin]] which destroys nerve tissue of mammals.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; In high enough concentrations, water treatment plants may be unable to remove the toxin and will advise residents to avoid drinking tap water, as happened in Toledo, Ohio in August 2014.&lt;ref name=Toledo/&gt;

They also cause harm by blocking the sunlight or by using up the oxygen needed by fish or plant life, which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  When such oxygen-depleted water covers a large area for an extended period of time, it can become [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]], commonly called a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. These dead zones can be the result of numerous different factors ranging from natural phenomenon to deliberate human interaction. These dead zones are not just limited to large bodies of fresh water as found in the great lakes, but are also prone to bodies of salt water as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html|title='Dead zone' is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red tides===
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|px240|A red tide off the coast of [[San Diego, California]]]]
{{main|Red tide}}

The other types of algae are [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s, found primarily in marine environments, such as ocean coastlines or bays, where they can also form algal blooms, commonly called [[red tide]]s. Red tides, however, may be a natural phenomenon,&lt;ref name=Red&gt;[http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml FAQs about red tides], Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department&lt;/ref&gt; although when they form close to coastlines or in estuaries. They can occur when warmer water, salinity, and nutrients reach certain levels, which then stimulates their growth.&lt;ref name=Red/&gt; Most red tide algae are dinoflagellates.&lt;ref name=monterey&gt;Ryan, John. [http://montereybay.noaa.gov/sac/2008/081508/081508ryan_ppt.pdf "Red Tide &amp; HAB Studies in Monterey Bay"], Monterey Bay Sanctuary Advisory Council Meeting, August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They are visible in water at a concentration of 1,000 algae cells per milliliter, while in dense blooms they can measure over 200,000 per milliliter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150901144353.htm "Intense, widespread algal blooms reported in Chesapeake Bay"], ''Science Daily'', Sept. 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Diatoms produce [[domoic acid]], another neurotoxin, which can cause seizures in higher vertebrates and birds as it concentrates up the food chain.&lt;ref name=marine&gt;[http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/science/top-research-projects/domoic-acid-toxicity.html "Domoic Acid Toxicity"], ''The Marine Mammal Center''&lt;/ref&gt; Domoic acid readily accumulates in the bodies of [[shellfish]], [[sardines]], and [[anchovies]], which if then eaten by [[sea lions]], [[otters]], [[cetaceans]],  birds or people, can affect the nervous system causing serious injury or death.&lt;ref name=marine/&gt; In the summer of 2015, the state governments closed important shellfish fisheries in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] because of high concentrations of domoic acid in shellfish.&lt;ref name=shellfish&gt;[https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/news/features/west_coast_algal_bloom/index.cfm "NOAA Fisheries mobilizes to gauge unprecedented West Coast toxic algal bloom"], Northwest Fisheries Science Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Among the causes of algal blooms are:
* chemical wastes, primarily nutrients—[[phosphorus]] and [[nitrates]]—from fertilizers or human waste,&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms |title=Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-09 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peebles/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Amin |first=Md Nurul |last2=Kroeze |first2=Carolien |last3=Strokal |first3=Maryna |date=2017 |title=Human waste: An underestimated source of nutrient pollution in coastal seas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025326X17301595 |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1-2 |pages=131–140 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.045 |issn=0025-326X |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* climate change with its resultant [[global warming]],&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;
* [[thermal pollution]] from power plants and factories, and
* low water levels in inland waterways and lakes, which reduces water flow and increases water temperatures.&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;[http://kutv.com/news/local/neurotoxic-algae-bloom-shuts-down-utah-lake "Neurotoxic algae bloom that shuts down Utah Lake can affect brain, liver"], ''KUTV'', July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russian&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5741904-181/russian-river-to-be-closely?artslide=0 "Russian River to be closely monitored this summer to guard against harmful algae blooms"], ''Press Democrat'', June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change, according to NOAA scientists, contributes to warmer waters which makes conditions more favorable for algae growth in more regions and farther north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/algal-blooms-likely-to-flourish-as-temperatures-climb "Algal blooms 'likely to flourish as temperatures climb'"], ''Straits Times'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Global warming is also considered a key factor for algal blooms in the Southern hemisphere, acknowledged by scientists in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sentinelsource.com/features/environment/the-disgusting-uptick-in-the-incidence-of-algae-blooms/article_147ea74e-d028-5191-88e9-c21d02bb7f95.html "The disgusting uptick in the incidence of algae blooms"], ''Washington Post'', August 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In general, still, warm, shallow water, combined with high-nutrient conditions in lakes or rivers, increases the risk of harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt;

Nutrients enter freshwater or marine environments as [[surface runoff]] from [[agricultural pollution]] and [[urban runoff]] from fertilized lawns, golf courses and other landscaped properties; and from [[sewage treatment plants]] that lack nutrient control systems.&lt;ref name="EPA-sources"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional nutrients are introduced from atmospheric pollution.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, G. Tyler Jr., ''Environmental Science'', Thomas Learning (2003) pp. 355{{endash}}357&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal areas worldwide, especially wetlands and estuaries, coral reefs and swamps, are prone to being overloaded with those nutrients.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Most of the large cities along the [[Mediterranean Sea]], for example, discharge all of their sewage into the sea untreated.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; The same is true for most coastal developing countries.

In the U.S., surface runoff is the largest source of nutrients added to rivers and lakes, but is mostly unregulated under the federal [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref name="EPA 319 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2016 |title=National Nonpoint Source Program: A catalyst for water quality improvements |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/319-grant-reports-and-project-summaries |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-16-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} &lt;ref name="NPDES basic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-07-25 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA |quote=By law, agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture are not 'point sources.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.circleofblue.org/2016/united-states/algal-blooms-no-accident-florida-everglades-estuaries/ |title=Algal Blooms Are No Accident For Florida Everglades and Estuaries |last=Kozacek |first=Code |date=2016-07-20 |website=Circle of Blue |location=Traverse City, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally developed initiatives to reduce [[nutrient pollution]] are underway in various areas of the country, such as the [[Great Lakes]] region and the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref name="EPA-Great Lakes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/glwqa |title=Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-08-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-Chesapeake TMDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl |title=Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-09 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help reduce algal blooms in [[Lake Erie]], the State of [[Ohio]] presented a plan in 2016 to reduce phosphorus runoff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/26/states-plan-to-restore-lake-erie-stops-short-of-mandating-farming-changes.html# "Ohio plan to restore Lake Erie won’t mandate farming changes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801131937/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/26/states-plan-to-restore-lake-erie-stops-short-of-mandating-farming-changes.html |date=2016-08-01 }}, ''The Columbus Dispatch'', July 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
====Texas==== 
Natural water reservoirs in [[Texas]] have been threatened by anthropogenic activities due to large petroleum refineries and oil wells (i.e. emission and wastewater discharge), massive agricultural activities (i.e. pesticide release) and mining extractions (i.e. toxic wastewater) as well as natural phe-nomena involving frequent HABs events. For the first time in 1985, the state of Texas documented the presence of the ''p. parvum'' (golden alga) bloom along the [[Pecos River]]. This phenomenon has affected 33 reservoirs in Texas along major river systems, including the Brazos, Canadian, Rio Grande, Colorado, and Red River, and has resulted in the death of more than 27 million fish and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharifan |first=Hamidreza |last2=Ma |first2=Xingmao |date=2017-08-31 |title=Potential Photochemical Interactions of UV Filter Molecules with Multichlorinated Structure of Prymnesins in Harmful Algal Bloom Events |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/152553/article |journal=Mini-Reviews in Organic Chemistry |volume=14 |issue=5 |doi=10.2174/1570193x14666170518124658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chesapeake Bay====
[[File:July 12, 2013 - Sassafras River, VA Algal Bloom (9321804011).jpg|thumb|An algal bloom on the [[Sassafras River]], a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay]]
The [[Chesapeake Bay]], the largest [[estuary]] in the U.S., has suffered from repeated large algal blooms for decades due to chemical runoff from multiple sources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-algae-blooms-20150508-story.html "Scientists eye increase in harmful algae in Chesapeake"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; including 9 large rivers and 141 smaller streams and creeks in parts of six states. In addition, the water is quite shallow and only 1% of the waste entering it gets flushed into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

By weight, 60% of the phosphates entering the bay in 2003 were from sewage treatment plants, while 60% of its nitrates came from fertilizer runoff, farm animal waste, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; About 300 million pounds (140 Gg) of nitrates are added to the bay each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus "Too Much Nitrogen and Phosphorus Are Bad for the Bay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728141032/http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus |date=2016-07-28 }}, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The population increase in the bay [[drainage basin|watershed]], from 3.7 million people in 1940 to 18 million in 2015 is also a major factor,&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; as economic growth leads to the increased use of fertilizers and rising emissions of industrial waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-nitrogen-pollution-accompanies-chinas-growth/ "Massive Nitrogen Pollution Accompanies China's Growth"], ''Scientific American'', Feb. 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e360.yale.edu/feature/on_lake_taihu_china_moves_to_battle_massive_algae_blooms/2429/  "On Lake Taihu, China Moves To Battle Massive Algae Blooms"], ''Environment 360'', Yale University, July 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the six states and the local governments in the Chesapeake watershed have upgraded their sewage treatment plants to control nutrient discharges. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that sewage treatment plant improvements in the Chesapeake region between 1985 and 2015 have prevented the discharge of 900 million pounds (410 Gg) of nutrients, with nitrogen discharges reduced by 57% and phosphorus by 75%.&lt;ref name="EPA-Chesapeake Pollution"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-pollution-reduction-chesapeake-bay-watershed |title=Wastewater Pollution Reduction in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-07-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural and urban runoff pollution continue to be major sources of nutrients in the bay, and efforts to manage those problems are continuing throughout the {{convert|64000|sqmi|km2}} watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/chesapeake-bay-tmdl-fact-sheet |title=Chesapeake Bay TMDL Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lake Erie====
Recent algae blooms in Lake Erie have been fed primarily by agricultural runoff and have led to warnings for some people in Canada and Ohio not to drink their water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/08/toledo_water_crisis_must_spark.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2014/10/toxic_lake_erie_algal_blooms_r.html&lt;/ref&gt; The International Joint Commission has called on United States and Canada to drastically reduce phosphorus loads into Lake Erie to address the threat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijc.org/en_/leep/report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.circleofblue.org/2014/world/joint-u-s-canada-agency-calls-big-phosphorus-reductions-lake-erie/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Green Bay====
Green Bay has a dead zone caused by phosphorus pollution that appears to be getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.twincities.com/2013/08/15/scientists-dead-zone-showing-up-in-waters-of-green-bay/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Okeechobee Waterway ====
[[File:Cropped lake okeechobee oli 2016184 lrg.jpg|thumb|2016 [[NASA]] imagery showing an [[algal bloom]] on [[Lake Okeechobee]]. ]]
[[Lake Okeechobee]] is an ideal habitat for cyanobacteria because it's shallow, sunny, and laden with nutrients from Florida's agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havens|first=Karl|last2=Li|first2=Bai-Lian|last3=Philips|first3=Edward|date=May 1998|title=Light availability as a possible regulator of cyanobacteria species composition in a shallow subtropical lake|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Phlips/publication/249440655_Light_availability_as_a_possible_regulator_of_cyanobacteria_species_composition_in_a_shallow_subtropical_lake/links/59dcace1aca2728e201f979d/Light-availability-as-a-possible-regulator-of-cyanobacteria-species-composition-in-a-shallow-subtropical-lake.pdf|journal=Freshwater Biology|volume=39|pages=547-556|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Okeechobee Waterway]] connects the lake to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] through the [[St. Lucie River]] and the [[Caloosahatchee River|Caloosahatchee]] respectively. This means that harmful algal blooms are carried down the estuaries as water is released during the wet summer months. In July 2018 up to 90% of Lake Okeechobee was covered in algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/algae-blooms-florida-nyt.html|title=Algae bloom in florida prompts fears about harm to health and economy|last=Gomez|first=Melissa|date=9 July 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water draining from the lake filled the region with a noxious odor and caused respiratory problems in some humans during the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/harmful-algal-blooms-linger-parts-southern-florida-july-and-august-2018|title=Harmful algal blooms linger in parts of southern Florida in July and August 2018|last=Di Liberto|first=Tom|date=16 August 2018|website=NOAA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, harmful red tide blooms are historically common on Florida's coasts during these same summer months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=Frank|date=August 2007|title=An assessment of Florida red tide: causes, consequences, and management strategies.|url=https://dspace.mote.org/bitstream/2075/2911/1/Alcock-MPI_RedTide.pdf|journal=Mote Marine Technical Report|volume=1190|pages=|via=Mote Marine Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria in the rivers die as they reach saltwater but their nitrogen fixation feeds the red tide on the coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Areas at the mouth of the estuaries such as [[Cape Coral, Florida|Cape Coral]] and [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] therefore experience the compounded effects of both types of harmful algal bloom. Cleanup crews hired by authorities in [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] - where the Caloosahatchee meets the Gulf of Mexico - removed more than 1700 tons of dead marine life in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/us/red-tide-fishkill-costs-trnd/index.html|title=Florida's red tide has produced 2,000 tons of dead marine life and cost businesses more than $8 million|last=Murphy|first=Paul|date=23 August 2018|work=CNN|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Coastal seas of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan====
[[Open defecation]] is common in south Asia, but human waste is an often overlooked source of nutrient pollution in marine pollution modeling. When nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contributed by human waste was included in models for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, the estimated N and P inputs to bodies of water increased one to two orders of magnitude compared to previous models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; River export of nutrients to coastal seas increases coastal [[eutrophication]] potential (ICEP). The ICEP of the [[Godavari River]] is three times higher when N and P inputs from human waste are included.

==Harmful effects==
As algal blooms grow, they deplete the oxygen in the water and block sunlight from reaching fish and plants. Such blooms can last from a few days to many months.&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; With less light, plants beneath the bloom can die and fish can starve.Furthermore, the dense population of a bloom reduces oxygen saturation during the night by respiration.  And when the algae eventually die off, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more oxygen, which in turn causes more fish to die or leave the area. When oxygen continues to be depleted by blooms it can lead to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/926 "Spreading Dead Zones and Consequences for Marine Ecosystems"], ''Science'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These dead zones in the case of the Chesapeake Bay, where they are a normal occurrence, are also suspected of being a major source of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dietrich |first=Tamara |date=2016-07-19 |title=Study: Chesapeake Bay a bigger methane generator than previously thought |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/science/dp-nws-chesapeake-bay-methane-20160719-story.html |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative impact on fish can be even more severe when they are confined to pens, as they are in fish farms. In 2007 a fish farm in [[British Columbia]] lost 260 tons of salmon as a result of blooms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedanddangerous.org/salmon-farming-problems/environmental-impacts/algae-blooms/ Algae Blooms in fish farming], Farmed and Dangerous.org&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a farm in Chile lost 23 million salmon after an algal bloom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/10/3758642/chile-algal-bloom-salmon/ "One Of The U.S.’s Top Salmon Providers Just Lost Millions Of Salmon"], ''Climate Progress'', March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NOAA, less than one percent of algal blooms produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]].&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/habharm.html "Are all algal blooms harmful?"], ''NOAA'', April 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although blue-green or other algae do not usually pose a direct threat to health, the [[toxins]] (poisons) which they produce are considered dangerous to humans, land animals, sea mammals,  birds&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; and fish when the toxins are ingested.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; The toxins are [[neurotoxins]] which destroy nerve tissue which can affect the nervous system, brain, and liver, and can lead to death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Tests have shown some toxins near blooms can be in the air and thereby be inhaled, which could affect health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://weather.com/science/environment/news/florida-martin-county-algae-toxic-air-particles-marina-rio "Tests Reveal Florida's Toxic Algae is Threatening Not Only The Water Quality but Also the Air"], ''Weather.com'', July 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no treatment available for animals, including livestock cattle, if they drink from algal blooms where such toxins are present. The Florida Department of Health recommends that people and pets be kept away from algal blooms to avoid contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marysvilleonline.net/news/article_49f895a6-4932-11e6-84b9-87884f9cfc1a.html?mode=print "Blue algae problems persist"], ''Marysville Online'', July 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
====Food====
Eating fish or shellfish from lakes with a bloom nearby is not recommended.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; A study has shown that algal toxins may be the cause for as many as 60,000 intoxication cases in the world each year.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoagland P., Anderson D.M., Kaoru Y., White A.W.|first=|date=August 2002|title=The Economic Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms in the United States: Estimates, Assessment Issues, and Information Needs|journal=Estuaries|volume=4b|pages=819|jstor=258443}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the accumulation of potent toxins in shellfish that consume those algae and then these shellfish are later consumed by humans which may result in [[Amnesic shellfish poisoning]], [[Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]], and [[Paralytic shellfish poisoning]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Toxic [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]] in the [[Philippines]] during [[red tide]]s has caused at least 120 deaths over a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ojs.wpro.who.int/ojs/index.php/wpsar/article/view/302/485 "Lethal paralytic shellfish poisoning from consumption of green mussel broth, Western Samar, Philippines, August 2013"], ''World Health Organization'', Issue #2, April–June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; After a HAB in [[Monterey Bay]], California, health officials warned people not to eat certain parts of anchovy, sardines, or crab caught in the bay.&lt;ref name=KSBW&gt;[http://www.ksbw.com/news/toxic-algae-blooms-killing-sea-birds-threaten-humans/25729808 "Toxic algae blooms killing sea birds, threaten humans"], ''KSBW'', April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 a new illness emerged which was called [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].

Agricultural officials in [[Utah]] worried that even crops could become contaminated if irrigated with toxic water, although they admit that they can't measure contamination accurately because of so many variables in farming. They issued warnings to residents, however, out of caution.&lt;ref name=KSL&gt;[https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40725118&amp;nid=148 "Effects of algal blooms continue to spread throughout Wasatch Front"], ''KSL TV'', July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drinking water====
[[File:Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Erie.jpg|thumb|px240|Satellite image of Lake Erie during an algal bloom in 2011]]
Persons are generally warned not to enter or drink water from algal blooms, or let their pets swim in the water since many pets have died from algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt; In at least one case, people began getting sick before warnings were issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgvtribune.com/environment-and-nature/20160718/people-got-sick-at-pyramid-lake-before-the-state-reported-toxic-algae-bloom-could-it-have-been-avoided "People got sick at Pyramid Lake before the state reported toxic algae bloom.

Scientists in Britain, which has seen a huge increase in toxic algae, suspect that drinking water from sources that have blue-green algae may contribute to [[Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson’s]] or [[Lou Gehrig’s Disease]]. Few water treatment plants regularly test for [[cyanobacteria]]l toxins, however.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11438278/British-lakes-see-huge-rise-in-toxic-algae-linked-to-Alzheimers.html "Drinking water could be poisoned with toxic algae linked to Alzheimer’s"], ''The Telegraph'', Feb. 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 the city of [[Toledo, Ohio]] advised its 500,000 residents to not drink tap water as the high toxin level from an algal bloom in western [[Lake Erie]] had affected their water treatment plant's ability to treat the water to a safe level.&lt;ref name=Toledo&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/toxic-algae-bloom-leaves-500-000-without-drinking-water-in-ohio-1881940537.html "Toxic Algae Bloom Leaves 500,000 Without Drinking Water in Ohio"], ''Ecowatch'', August 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency required using bottled water for all normal uses except showering, which seriously affected public services and commercial businesses.

Alan Steinman of [[Grand Valley State University]] has explained that among the major causes for the algal blooms in general, and Lake Erie specifically, is because blue-green algae thrive with high nutrients, along with warm and calm water. Lake Erie is more prone to blooms because it has a high nutrient level and is shallow, which causes it to warm up more quickly during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Video interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2PsjhiZl2Q&amp;t=38s Dr. Alan Steinman on Algal Blooms in Lake Erie] 13 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms from drinking toxic water can show up within a few hours after exposure. They can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, or trigger headaches and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Although rare, liver toxicity can cause death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Those symptoms can then lead to dehydration, another major concern. In high concentrations, the toxins in the algal waters when simply touched can cause skin rashes, irritate the eyes, nose, mouth or throat.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Those with suspected symptoms are told to call a doctor if symptoms persist or they can't hold down fluids after 24 hours.

===Economic impact===
====Recreation and tourism====
The hazards which accompany harmful algal blooms have hindered visitors' enjoyment of beaches and lakes in places in the U.S. such as Florida,&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;[http://wlrn.org/post/summer-heat-could-worsen-algae-blooms-florida-waters "Summer Heat Could Worsen Algae Blooms In Florida Waters"], ''WLRN'', July 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref name=California&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-pyramid-lake-algae-bloom-20160714-snap-story.html "Summer conditions growing toxic algae blooms in two California lakes"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Vt-Beaches-Reopen-After-Algae-Blooms-Clear-386953991.html "Vt.

Similar blooms have become more common in Europe, with France among the countries reporting them.

The economic damage resulting from lost business has become a serious concern. According to one report in 2016, the four main economic impacts from harmful algal blooms come from damage to human health, fisheries, tourism and recreation, and the cost of monitoring and management of area where blooms appear.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt; EPA estimates that algal blooms impact 65 percent of the country's major estuaries, with an annual cost of $2.2 billion.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; In the U.S. there are an estimated 166 coastal dead zones.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; Because data collection has been more difficult and limited from sources outside the U.S., most of the estimates as of 2016 have been primarily for the U.S.&lt;ref name=JRC&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/algal-bloom-and-its-economic-impact "Algal bloom and its economic impact"], ''European Commission Joint Research Centre'', 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In port cities in the [[Shandong Province]] of eastern China, residents are no longer surprised when massive algal blooms arrive each year and inundate beaches. Prior to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, over 10,000 people worked to clear 20,000 tons of dead algae from beaches.&lt;ref name=China&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-yellow-sea-turns-green-qingdao-beaches-are-covered-algae-photos-1509734 "China: Yellow Sea turns green as Qingdao beaches are covered in algae"], ''International Business Times'', July 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 another bloom in China, thought to be its largest ever,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-china-largest-ever-algae-bloom.html "China hit by largest-ever algae bloom"], ''Phys.org'', July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; covered an area of 7,500 square miles,&lt;ref name=China/&gt; and was followed by another in 2015 which blanketed an even greater 13,500 square miles. The blooms in China are thought to be caused by pollution from untreated agricultural and industrial discharges into rivers leading to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/china-has-an-algae-beach-pollution-problem-2015-7?r=UK&amp;IR=T "Slimy green algae is taking over China's beaches for an alarming reason"], ''Business Insider'', July 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fisheries industry====
[[File:NOAA Pacific coast 2015.jpg|thumb|px240|West coast algal bloom of 2015 which led to closing of fisheries]]
As early as 1976 a short-term, relatively small, dead zone off the coasts of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] cost commercial and recreational fisheries over $500 million.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; In 1998 a red tide in Hong Kong killed over $10 million in high-value fish.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

In 2009, the economic impact for the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington's]] coastal counties dependent on its fishing industry was estimated to be $22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miner |first=Colin |date=2009-11-27 |title=Assessing Algal Blooms’ Economic Impact |url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/assessing-algal-blooms-economic-impact/ |work=New York Times |series=Green: Energy, the Environment and the Bottom Line (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the U.S. seafood industry expected future lost revenue could amount to $900 million annually.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt;

NOAA has provided a few cost estimates for various blooms over the past few years:&lt;ref name=NOAA3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaa.gov/what-is-harmful-algal-bloom |title=What is a harmful algal bloom? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-04-27 |website= |publisher=U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; $10.3 million in 2011 due to the red tide at Texas oyster landings; $2.4 million lost income by tribal commerce from 2015 fishery closures in the pacific northwest; $40 million from Washington state's loss of tourism from the same fishery closure.

Along with damage to businesses, the toll from human sickness results in lost wages and damaged health. The costs of medical treatment, investigation by health agencies through water sampling and testing, and the posting of warning signs at effected locations is also costly.&lt;ref name=WHOI&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=24159&amp;pt=10&amp;p=19132 "Estimated Annual Economic Impacts from Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the United States"], Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The closures applied to areas where this algae bloom occurs has a big negative impact of the fishing industries, add to that the high fish mortality that follows, the increase in price due to the shortage of fish available and decrease in the demand for seafood due to the fear of contamination by toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Algae bloom and its economic impact |last=Sanseverino |first=Isabella |publisher=JRC publications |year=2016 |isbn=978-92-79-58101-4 |location=Europe |pages=23, 26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes a big economic loss for the industry.

Economic costs are estimated to rise. In June 2015, for instance, the largest known toxic HAB forced the shutdown of the west coast shellfish industry, the first time that has ever happened. One Seattle NOAA expert commented, "This is unprecedented in terms of the extent and magnitude of this harmful algal bloom and the warm water conditions we're seeing offshore...."&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/06/west_coast_shellfish_industrie.html "Biggest-ever toxic algal bloom hits West Coast, shutting down shellfish industries"], ''Oregon Live'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The bloom covered a range from [[Santa Barbara, California]] northward to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/toxic-algae-bloom-in-pacific-ocean-could-be-largest-ever/ "Toxic algae bloom in Pacific Ocean could be largest ever"], ''CBS News'', June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Global warming and pollution is causing algal blooms to form in places previously considered "impossible" or rare for them to exist, such as under the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/arctic-algal-blooms-060712.html "NASA mission, led by Stanford biologist, finds massive algal blooms under Arctic sea ice"], ''Stanford News'', June 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/18915-antarctic-algae-bloom-nasa.html "Behemoth Antarctic Algae Bloom Seen from Space"], ''Life Science'', March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Himalayan Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/pollution-neglect-and-too-much-love-killing-once-idyllic-himalayan-lake-20111104-1mzw0.html "Pollution, neglect and too much love killing once idyllic Himalayan lake"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Nov. 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://jordanramis.com/water-law-blog/addressing-algal-blooms-in-rocky-mountain-national-park/ "Addressing Algal Blooms in Rocky Mountain National Park"], Jordan Ramis, August 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/emergency/wilderness/Sierra_Algae-pdf10-14-09.pdf " Algae in Sierra Nevada Mountain Wilderness Areas: Potential Health Hazards"], ''Journal of Mountain Medicine and Ecology'', University of California, Davis, Fall 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fish die-offs====
[[File:Atibaia 2014-02-19 - Seca no Rio Atibaia (3) (13587504875).jpg|thumb|px240|Massive fish die-off in Brazil]]
Massive fish die-offs have been caused by HABs.&lt;ref name=WHOI-2&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/science/B/redtide/foodweb/fishkills.html "Fish Kills due to Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 23 million salmon which were being farmed in Chile died from a toxic algae bloom.&lt;ref name=salmon&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/23-million-salmon-dead-due-to-toxic-algal-bloom-in-chile-1882188276.html "23 Million Salmon Dead Due to Toxic Algal Bloom in Chile"], ''EcoWatch'', March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; To get rid of the dead fish, the ones fit for consumption were made into fishmeal and the rest were dumped 60 miles offshore to avoid risks to human health.&lt;ref name=salmon/&gt; The economic cost of that die-off is estimated to have been $800 million.&lt;ref name=salmon/&gt; Environmental expert [[Lester Brown]] has written that the farming of salmon and shrimp in offshore ponds concentrates waste, which contributes to [[eutrophication]] and the creation of dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R.

Other countries have reported similar impacts, with cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil seeing major fish die-offs from blooms becoming a common occurrence.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/21/brazil-removes-50-tons-of-dead-fish-from-olympic-waters.html "Brazil removes 50 tons of dead fish from Olympic waters"], ''Aljazeera'', April 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Rio collected an estimated 50 tons of dead fish from the lagoon where water events in the 2016 Olympics were planned to take place.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;

The [[Monterey Bay]] has suffered from harmful algal blooms, most recently in 2015: "Periodic blooms of toxin-producing ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'' diatoms have been documented for over 25 years in Monterey Bay and elsewhere along the U.S. west coast.

====Land animal deaths====
Land animals, including livestock and pets have been affected.

"Our leading theory at this point is that the harmful algal bloom has contributed to the deaths," said a NOAA spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigerian-news.com/30-dead-whales-wash-ashore-in-alaska-scientists-commence-investigations/ "30 Dead Whales Wash Ashore In Alaska; Scientists Commence Investigations"], ''Nigerian News'', August 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/6223-toxic-algae-blooms-could-be-causing-whale-deaths "Toxic Algae Could Be Killing Dozens of Whales"], ''Inverse'', Sept. 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have died after eating dead fish contaminated with toxic algae. Rotting and decaying fish are eaten by birds such as [[pelicans]], [[seagulls]], [[cormorant]]s, and possibly marine or land mammals, which then become poisoned.&lt;ref name=WHOI-2/&gt; The nervous systems of dead birds were examined and had failed from the toxin's effect.&lt;ref name=KSBW/&gt; On the Oregon and Washington coast, a thousand [[scoter]]s, or sea ducks, were also killed in 2009. ""This is huge," said a University professor.&lt;ref name=Oregon2&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/10/foam_from_ocean_algae_bloom_ki.html "Foam from ocean algae bloom killing thousands of birds"], ''Oregon Live'', October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As dying or dead birds washed up on the shore, wildlife agencies went into "an emergency crisis mode."&lt;ref name=Oregon2/&gt;

It has even been suggested that harmful algal blooms are responsible for the deaths of animals found in fossil troves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gramling C. |year=2017 |title=Toxic algae may be culprit in mysterious dinosaur deaths |journal=Science |volume=357 |issue=6354 |page=857 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6354/857.1 |pmid=28860363 |doi=10.1126/science.357.6354.857-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====More dead zones====
[[File:Gulf dead zone.jpg|thumb|px240|Dead zone in the southern U.S.]]
According to NOAA, blooms can harm the environment even without producing toxins by depleting oxygen from the water when growing and while decaying after they die. Blooms can also block sunlight to organisms living beneath it. A record-breaking number and size of blooms have formed in the Pacific coast, in Lake Erie, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the Gulf of Mexico, where a number of dead zones were created as a result.&lt;ref name=Huffington/&gt; In the 1960s the number of dead zones worldwide was 49; the number rose to over 400 by 2008.&lt;ref name=SciAm2&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oceanic-dead-zones-spread/ "Oceanic Dead Zones Continue to Spread"], ''Scientific American'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. they are especially prevalent along the east and south coasts.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

Various important natural habitats such as rivers, lakes and [[estuaries]] have continued to degrade and has contributed to creating more oxygen-deprived [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], including some in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/49347-lake-erie-dead-zone-drought.html "Lake Erie Dead Zone: Don't Blame the Slime!"], ''Live Science'', January 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Circle2&gt;Kozacek, Codi.

Among the largest dead zones were those in northern Europe’s [[Baltic Sea]] and the Gulf of Mexico, which affects a $2.8 billion U.S. fish industry.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt; Unfortunately, dead zones rarely recover and usually grow in size.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; One of the few dead zones to ever recover was in the [[Black Sea]], which returned to normal fairly quickly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s due to a resulting reduction in fertilizer use.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

==Potential remedies==
===Chemical treatment and dams===
Although a number of [[algaecide]]s have been effective in killing algae, they have been used mostly in small bodies of water. For large algal blooms, however, adding algaecides such as silver nitrate or copper sulfate can have worse effects, such as killing fish outright and harming other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Greensburg&gt;[http://www.greensburgdailynews.com/news/local_news/what-is-creeping-into-our-lakes/article_d77a16fa-ef97-5f5c-bb18-ae7b1acca0fa.html "What is creeping into our lakes?"], ''Greensburg Daily News'', August 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects can therefore be worse than letting the algae die off naturally.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSU/&gt;

Other experts have proposed building reservoirs to prevent the movement of algae downstream. However, that can lead to the growth of algae within the reservoir, which become sediment traps with a resultant buildup of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt; Some researchers found that intensive blooms in reservoirs were the primary source of toxic algae observed downstream, but the movement of algae has so far been less studied, although it is considered a likely cause of algae transport.&lt;ref name=OSU&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/jun/toxic-algal-blooms-behind-klamath-river-dams-create-health-risks-far-downstream "Toxic algal blooms behind Klamath River dams create health risks far downstream"], ''Oregon State University News'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/control-and-treatment |title=Control and Treatment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-02 |website=Nutrient Policy and Data |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of scientists agree that there is an urgent need to protect the public by being able to forecast harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Richtel |first=Matt |date=2016-07-18 |title=A Dreaded Forecast for Our Times: Algae, and Lots of It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/science/a-dreaded-forecast-for-our-times-algae-and-lots-of-it.html?_r=1 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way they hope to do that is with sophisticated sensors which can help warn about potential blooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The same types of sensors can also be used by water treatment facilities to help them prepare for higher toxic levels.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sensors now in use are located in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008 similar sensors in the Gulf forewarned of an increased level of toxins which led to a shutdown of shellfish harvesting in Texas along with a recall of mussels, clams and oysters, possibly saving many lives. With an increase in the size and frequency of HABs, experts state the need for significantly more sensors located around the country.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt; The same kinds of sensors can also be used to detect threats to drinking water from intentional contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/homeland-security-research/water-system-security-and-resilience-homeland-security-research |title=Water System Security and Resilience in Homeland Security Research |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four U.S. federal agencies—EPA, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), NOAA, and the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS)—are working on ways to detect and measure cyanobacteria blooms using satellite data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/us-agencies-creating-algal-bloom-early-warning-system/ "US agencies creating algal bloom early warning system"], ''Algae Industry Magazine'', April 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The data may help develop early-warning indicators of cyanobacteria blooms by monitoring both local and national coverage.&lt;ref name=satellite&gt;[http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/2015-12-21-cyanobacteria_sensing.html "Remote Sensing Provides a National View of Cyanobacteria Blooms"], USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 automated early-warning monitoring systems were successfully tested, and for the first time proven to identify the rapid growth of algae and the subsequent depletion of oxygen in the water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news.virginia.edu/content/scientists-develop-early-warning-system-toxic-algae-blooms "Scientists Develop Early-Warning System for Toxic Algae Blooms"], ''UVA Today'', Univ. of Virginia, Jan. 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the U.S. at least, funding for such warning devices has been shrinking, with approved funding down 45% over the last five years.{{When|date=August 2018}} According to one marine science professor, "We need it more than ever, and we’ve brought ourselves to the precipice of making great forecasts, but we can’t make it happen."&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;

===Reducing chemical runoff===
[[File:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|px240|Soil and fertilizer runoff from a farm after heavy rains]]
The nitrates and phosphorus in fertilizers cause algal blooms when they run off into lakes and rivers after heavy rains. Modifications in farming methods have been suggested, such as only using fertilizer in a targeted way at the appropriate time exactly where it can do the most good for crops to reduce potential runoff.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; A method used successfully is [[drip irrigation]], which instead of widely dispersing fertilizers on fields, drip-irrigates plant roots through a network of tubes and emitters, leaving no traces of fertilizer to be washed away.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Seth M. ''Let There Be Water: Israel’s Solution for a Water-Starved World'', Macmillan (2015) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), drip irrigation also prevents the formation of algal blooms in [[reservoirs]] for drinking water&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/4819/Israel:_Innovations_overcoming_water_scarcity.html "Israel: Innovations overcoming water scarcity"], ''OECD Observer'', April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while saving up to 50% of water typically used by agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jun/16/israel-drought-water-reclamation/ "How Israel survived its devastating drought"], ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of states in the U.S. have tried eliminating [[phosphates in detergent]] and by cleaning{{Vague|date=September 2017}} water treatment plants, which succeeded in reducing the amount that entered Lake Erie by 66%.{{Failed verification|date=September 2017 |reason=No mention of 'cleaned' plants reducing phosphorus in cited article}} However, changes in farming practices during that period increased chemical runoff, thereby offsetting the improvements.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;Biello, David. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-algae-are-everywhere-thanks-to-agriculture/ "Deadly Algae Are Everywhere, Thanks to Agriculture"], ''Scientific American'', August 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been proposals to create buffer zones of foliage and wetlands to help filter out the phosphorus before it reaches water.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Other experts have suggested using conservation tillage, changing crop rotations, and restoring wetlands.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; "The most important thing that can be done is to reduce agricultural runoff," according to a Great Lakes pollution expert. "Prevention is better than treatment."&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Another expert states that it is possible for some dead zones to shrink within a year under proper management.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

There have been a few success stories in controlling chemicals. After Norway's lobster fishery collapsed in 1986 due to low oxygen levels, for instance, the government in neighboring Denmark took action and reduced phosphorus output by 80 percent which brought oxygen levels closer to normal.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;Larsen, Janet. [http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2004/update41 "Dead Zones Increasing in the World's Coastal Waters"], Earth Policy Institute, June 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dead zones in the [[Black Sea]] and along the [[Danube River]] recovered after phosphorus applications by farmers were reduced by 60%.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

In 2008, the U.S. government prepared a report on the problem, "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan".&lt;ref name=US&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152427/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf |date=2013-05-10 }}, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Sept. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The change recognized the seriousness of the problem:
{{quote|It is widely believed that the frequency and geographic distribution of HABs have been increasing worldwide. All U.S. coastal states have experienced HABs over the last decade, and new species have emerged in some locations that were not previously known to cause problems. HAB frequency is also thought to be increasing in freshwater systems.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;}}
The report suggested among other remedies, using improved monitoring methods, trying to improve predictability, and testing new potential methods of controlling HABs.&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Some countries surrounding the Baltic Sea, which has the world's largest dead zone, have considered using massive geoengineering options, such as forcing air into bottom layers to aerate them.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

In 2015, NOAA created 12 new research grants totaling nearly $2.1 million which they would award to national organizations doing research on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, which they consider to be "two of the most scientifically complex and economically damaging coastal issues."&lt;ref name=NOAA4/&gt;

===Monitoring and reporting===
Most countries, states and large cities have departments which will help monitor and report incidents of algal blooms. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the U.S. launched the country's first algal bloom reporting system in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/a0622-algal-blooms.html "CDC launches first national reporting system for harmful algal blooms and associated illnesses"], CDC, June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental agencies in individual U.S. states will accept reports of blooms from citizens and will work with cities to test and report incidents to the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13247">'''Harold D. Roth''' is a professor of [[religious studies]] and the Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown University. Roth is a specialist in Methods of [[Textual Criticism]] and Textual History, Classical Chinese Religious Thought, [[Daoism|Classical Daoism]], the Comparative Study of Mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of Contemplative Studies.

==Biography==
During an academic career spanning over three decades, Roth has done ground- breaking work in three major intellectual fields. In the first, textual criticism, following the lead of the late SOAS professor Paul Thompson, Roth did the first complete textual history of a major Classical Chinese philosophical work, which he published in his first book, ''The Textual History of the Huai-nan Tzu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Textual History of the Huainanzi|date=1992|publisher=Association for Asian Studies Monograph No. 46|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period, Roth developed a distinctive method he called "Filiation Analysis", a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions. This is detailed in his very first publication,  "Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Transactions of the Conference  of Orientalists in Japan|date=1982|volume=27|issue=December|pages=60–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further developed as a model for all classical Chinese philosophical texts in a later publication, "Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 1993|volume=113|issue=2|pages=18–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major area in which Roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late Warring States and early Han dynasty tradition that he dubbed "inner cultivation". It is this tradition that was given the moniker "Daoism" by the Grand Historian [[Sima Tan]] circa 110 BCE.  Beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990s, "Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|date=December 1991|volume=51|issue=2|pages=599–650|doi=10.2307/2719289}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?|editor1-last=Rosemont, Jr.|editor1-first=Henry|title=Chinese Texts and Philosophical Contexts: Essays Dedicated to Angus C. Graham|date=1991|publisher=Open Court Press|location=London|pages=79–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Daoism|journal=Early China|date=1994|volume=19|pages=1–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical Chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories: cosmology, psychology/inner cultivation, and political thought. Expanding the work of [[A.C. Graham]], he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings, "Individualist", Primitivist, and Syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical Daoist tradition. Roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled ''[[Neiye]]'' ("Inward Training"), one of 76 works in the Guanzi 管子 compendium, published in his second book, ''Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Original Tao: Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism|date=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li 理 (Pattern, Principle) made by this classical Daoist tradition in "The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Chinese Cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Daoist Cosmology|journal=Early China|date=2012–2013|volume=35-36|issue=Studies in Honor of Li Xueqin|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition Roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical Chinese religious traditions. In addition to being summarized in Original Tao, his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications: "Evidence for Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Evidence for the Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|date=June 1997|volume=60|issue=2|pages=295–314|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00036405}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Praxis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D. Roth|authorlink1=Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Practice|editor1-last=Csikszentmihalyi|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Ivanhoe|editor2-first=P.J.|title=Essays on Religious and Philosophical Aspects of the Lao Tzu|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=59–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  "Bimodal Mystical Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold D.|title=Bimodal Experience in the 'Qiwulun' of Zhuangzi|journal=Journal of Chinese Religions|date=2000|volume=28|pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting when he entered the Ph.D. program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1975, Roth began a fascination with the early [[Han dynasty]]  (139 BCE) philosophical compendium, the [[Huainanzi]]  淮南子, until recently the last great untranslated work of classical Chinese philosophy. Intended as a comprehensive multi-authored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the Chinese emperor needed to be conversant, the Huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony, astronomy, geography, rulership, and warfare, to name a few of its major topics. Roth has argued that while the Huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions, that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical Daoism. After working on the textual history of this major work in his first book, in the mid 1990s Roth developed a project for the first complete English translation with colleague John Major and, eventually, a small cohort of additional scholars that included, most importantly, Sarah Queen and Andrew Meyer. Together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation, The Huainanzi:  A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Huainanzi: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an abridged translation, The Essential Huainanzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Major|first1=John, et. al.|title=The Essential Huainanzi|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his work on these translations and to his first book, Roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the Huainanzi  in a number of publications, including "The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Harold|title=The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu|journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy|date=April 1985|volume=12|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6253.1985.tb00425.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roth, Harold D.|authorlink1=Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi's 'Original Way'|editor1-last=Chandler|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Littlejohn|editor2-first=Ronnie|title=Polishing the Chinese Mirror: Essays in Honor of Henry Rosemont|date=2007|publisher=Global Scholarly Publications|location=New York|pages=270–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold D.

Roth|authorlink1=Daoism in the Guanzi|editor1-last=Liu|editor1-first=Xiaogan|title=Dao Companion to Daoist Philosophy|date=2014|publisher=Springer Press|location=New York|pages=265–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of "Contemplative Studies", he is also the person who first coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaleem|first1=Jaweed|title=Contemplative Studies Grow at Brown University- And Beyond|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/contemplative-studies-brown_n_6124030.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the disciplines of the relevant Brain Sciences, Humanities, and Creative Arts around the systematic third and first-person study of contemplative experiences, across cultures and across time, this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory. Inspired by the work of scientists such as Francisco Varela, James Austin, and Richard Davidson, philosophers such as William James and Evan Thompson, and educators such as John Dewey and Parker Palmer, Brown Contemplative Studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Emma|title=Contemplating a New Major? Try Contemplative Studies|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/06/03/contemplating-a-new-major-try-contemplative-studies/|website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as "Contemplative Studies: Prospects for a New Field", Columbia Teacher's College Record (2006); "Against Cognitive Imperialism", Religion East and West (2008); "Contemplative Studies:  Can It Flourish in the Religious Studies Classroom?" Meditation and  the Classroom: Contemplative Pedagogy for Religious Studies (2011);  and "A Pedagogy for the New Field of Contemplative Studies", Contemplative Approaches to Learning and Inquiry across Disciplines (2014). In 2014 Brown University became the first major North American Research University to establish a formal undergraduate concentration (major) in Contemplative Studies. This pioneering multi-disciplinary concentration requires 14 courses including a core set of 5 required courses in relevant Brain Sciences and Humanities. Students then choose a Sciences track that features Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience or a Humanities Track that features Philosophy of Mind and Contemplative Religious Traditions. Art concentrations within the Humanities Track are also possible.

Additionally, Roth has served these academic fields in a variety of ways. He served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Study of Chinese Religions for a decade starting in 1993, during which time he has also served on the editorial boards of four international journals of Daoism and Early Chinese Studies. In addition to this he was the founder and Co-Organizer of the New England Symposium on Chinese Thought (1988–93), the organizer of four academic panels at the Association for Asian Studies and American Oriental Society, and the Co-Organizer of the Second American-Japanese Conference on Taoist Studies (1998).  He has been a member of the initial Steering Committees for two groups within the American Academy of Religion, the Daoist Studies Section and the Contemplative Studies Group. He has been on the planning committees for the Mind and Life Institute Summer Research Institutes and the first and second International Symposia on Contemplative Studies (2012 and 2014).

Finally, a long time student of the Rinzai Zen Master Kyozan Joshu Sasaki (1907-2014), Roth was recently named to Chair the Publications Committee for Sasaki's teaching materials.

The '''Institut d'astrophysique de Paris''' (translated: Paris Institute of [[Astrophysics]]) is a research institute in [[Paris]], [[France]].
The Institute is part of the [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] and is associated with the CNRS [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]].  It is located at 98bis, Boulevard Arago Il in the 14th [[arrondissement]] of Paris, adjacent to the [[Paris Observatory]].

== History ==
The IAP was created in 1936 by the French ministry of education under [[Jean Zay]], initially for the purpose of processing data received from the [[observatoire de Haute-Provence|Observatory of Haute-Provence]], which was created at the same time. Construction of the building started on the 6th of January 1938.  On the 15th of June the following year, [[Henri Mineur]] became the institute's first director. IAP scientists were at first  located in Paris Observatory, then in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure de Paris]] before arriving in the current building in 1944 which was finally completed in 1952.

==Current research==
The IAP includes 160 researchers, engineers, technicians, and administrators and regularly welcomes many visitors and students.

The main areas of research at the IAP are:

* [[General relativity]] and [[cosmology]]
* [[Structure formation|Cosmological structure formation]]
* [[High-energy astronomy|High-energy astrophysics]] 	
* Origin and evolution of [[galaxy|galaxies]]
* [[Stellar structure]]
* [[Exoplanets]]

The IAP is one of five laboratories of AERA, the European association for research in astronomy. The laboratory is situated at the interface between two disciplines, astrophysics and theoretical physics. The [[International Astronomical Union]] has its seat at the IAP.

The '''Institute of Space Propulsion''' in [[Lampoldshausen]] is one of the eight research centers of the [[German Aerospace Center|German Aerospace Center (DLR)]].

Approximately 220 people work there in the fields of research and tests of [[rocket engine]]s. The main purpose of the facility is the operation of test stands for space propulsion on behalf of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] and in cooperation with the European space industry.

== Test stands ==
The facility has a surface area of approximately 35 ha, on which are seven test stands.

=== Test stand P1 ===
At the altitude test stand P1 are tested small engines with a thrust up to 600 N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dlr.de/ra/Portaldata/55/Resources/dokumente/StatusReport_Teil_1_lowres_Gesamt.pdf|title = Lampoldshausen status report 2011|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, thrusters for [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control Systems (RCS)]] and [[Apogee kick motor|Apogee Kick Motors (AKM)]] fall in this category.

=== Test stand P2 ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 1.jpg|thumb|Test stand P2]]
The test stand P2 is used for testing [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]] engines with a thrust up to 100&amp;nbsp;kN under ground conditions.

=== Test stand P3 ===
The test stand P3 is a component test stand for [[Cryogenic fuel|cryogenic]] propellants. It was set up mainly for the development and tests of [[combustion chamber]]s, in particular those of the [[Vulcain|Vulcain 1]] and [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] engines for the European launcher [[Ariane 5]].

=== Test stand P4 (P4.1 / P4.2) ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 2.jpg|thumb|Test stand P4]]
The vacuum test stand P4 is composed of two test stands P4.1 and P4.2. Tests with the [[Aestus]] engine can be carried out at the P4.2 test stand, whereas the test stand P4.1 has been used for the [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci]] upper stage engine.

=== Test stand P5 ===
[[File:Lampoldshausen 2009 3.jpg|thumb|Test stand P5]]
The test stand P5 has been used for the development and the qualification of the Vulcain and Vulcain 2 engines. Today, it is mainly used to test engines in the frame of the ESA ARTA program.

=== Test stand P6 ===
The test stand P6 is an altitude test stand for [[cold gas thruster]]s.

=== Test stand P8 ===
In the frame of a German-French cooperation arose the idea to build a common ''European Research and Technology test stand'' P8. The partners [[Snecma|SNECMA]], [[Astrium]], [[CNES]] and [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] made a start on this project in 1992. The main purpose of this test stand is the research about high pressure combustion of hydrogen and oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9879">[[File:International Research Center for Japanese Studies.jpg|thumb|300px|Building of Nichibunken]]
The {{nihongo|'''International Research Center for Japanese Studies'''|国際日本文化研究センター|Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā}}, or '''Nichibunken''' (日文研), is an inter-university research institute in [[Kyoto]].  Along with the [[National Institute of Japanese Literature]], the [[National Museum of Japanese History]], and the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Museum of Ethnology]], it is one of the [[National Institutes for the Humanities]].  The center is devoted to research related to [[Japanese culture]].

==History of the Center==
The official origins of the institute are traced to an early study carried out by the [[Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture]] in 1982 on "methods of comprehensive research on Japanese culture".  After surveying the field of Japanese studies for several years, the ministry, under the administration of Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro]], established the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in 1987 in [[Kyoto]] with the prominent philosopher [[Umehara Takeshi]] as its first Director-General.  Prominent Kyoto academics [[Umesao Nobuo]] and [[Kuwabara Takeo]] also played key roles in the founding of the center. 

In 1990 the center moved to its current site in Oeyama-chō, Nishikyō-ku.  In 1995 [[Kawai Hayao]], a [[Jungian]] analyst of Japanese psychology and religion, was inaugurated as the second director-general of Nichibunken.  In 2001, [[Yamaori Tetsuo]], professor of Japanese religion and folklore, became the center's third director-general.  The current director-general, [[Motoko Katakura|Katakura Motoko]], was inaugurated in 2005.  She is Nichibunken's first female director-general and, as a cultural-anthropologist who specializes in Middle-Eastern Studies, she is also the center's first director-general who is not a Japan specialist.

==Criticisms of the Center==
Nichibunken was established against the backdrop of an increasing trade surplus with the United States in the 1980s.  One of the ostensible impulses behind the founding of the center was a desire to change overseas perceptions of Japan that viewed the country as a faceless economic power.  The cultural-anthropologist [[Ueno Chizuko]] sharply criticized the center as a calculated attempt at national branding.  Ueno claimed that, despite the center's academic pretensions, the real purpose of Nichibunken was to improve the image of Japan in order to prevent criticism of Japanese trading practices and improve sales of Japanese goods abroad.  [[Ian Buruma]] caused considerable outrage at the time for arguing in influential newspapers abroad that the establishment of the Center was part of a project designed to revamp the kind of nationalist ideology current in pre-war Japan. The center has also been criticized for promoting theories of Japanese particularism. 

The appointment of [[Katakura Motoko]] as Nichibunken's fourth director-general may be seen as an attempt by the center to revamp its conservative image and distance itself from associations with theories of Japanese particularism.  Katakura, a specialist in the anthropology of the Middle-East, is a relative outsider to the field of Japanese studies.

==The Nichibunken Library==
A library of Japanese Studies is attached to the center.  The collection primarily consists of books and bibliographic materials pertinent to the academic study of Japan.  As of 2014, the library contains approximately 400,000 volumes of books in Japanese and 97,000 volumes in other languages.  It also houses approximately 4,400 Japanese periodicals and about 1,000 foreign language periodicals. The library has also a significant storage of media materials in form of records, video and other digital forms.

==Publications==
Nichibunken publishes two periodicals in the field of Japanese studies: Japan Review in English and Nihon Kenkyū (in Japanese). Japan Review is a peer-reviewed journal available on JSTOR and on the Nichibunken website. Japan Review, which is published annually, accepts outstanding essays on Japanese culture from scholars across the globe, as well as research notes. It carries reviews of important books on Japanese studies. Japan Review also publishes Special Issues, the first of which was published in 2013 as "Shunga: Sex and Humor in Japanese Art and Literature." The bi-annual Nihon Kenkyū is also peer reviewed and invites contributions from scholars everywhere.

'''LULI : Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation des Lasers Intenses'' ('''LULI''') &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luli.polytechnique.fr LULI webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientific research laboratory specialised in the study of plasmas generated by [[laser]]-matter interaction at high intensities and their applications. The main missions of LULI include: (i) Research in [[Plasma Physics]], (ii) Development and operation of high-power high-energy lasers and experimental facilities, (iii) student formation in Plasma Physics, Optics and Laser Physics.

==Research in Plasma Physics==

Focusing the extreme power of pulsed lasers (up to the petawatt level, 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;W) onto tiny spots, µm to mm in diameter, leads to ultrahigh intensities reaching today 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more. Targets irradiated at such intensities can reach temperatures of the order of hundred million degrees and pressures of tens of megabars.  Moreover, the electric and magnetic fields associated with the laser beam itself or the fields produced in the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] are responsible for the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies and to the production of intense radiation from THz to x-rays and γ-rays.

The main subjects studied by LULI's scientists include [[Inertial confinement fusion|laser inertial fusion]] and all its physical components (e.g. laser-plasma interaction), fundamental physics of hot and dense plasmas and its applications in [[astrophysics]] and [[geophysics]]. In the short-pulse picosecond regime, the main developments concern the fast-igniter scheme for inertial fusion, and the production of brief and intense sources of radiation and relativistic particles.

==National and International Facility==

LULI is the French national civilian facility dedicated to research using high-energy high-power lasers and their applications. French and foreign users have access to the two most energetic French academic laser chains: 100TW and [[LULI2000]].

The main beam of the 100TW facility delivers 30 J in 300 fs at 1.06&amp;nbsp;µm. It is coupled with additional nanosecond and picosecond beams. Nano2000, the nanosecond version of [[LULI2000]] consists in two laser beams delivering each 1 kJ in nanosecond pulses at 1.06&amp;nbsp;µm. PICO2000 couples one of these nanosecond beams with a 200 J picosecond beam. Each of these facilities is coupled to a dedicated experimental area.

The development of the laser sources is supported by an important R&amp;D programme in high-power laser related optics and laser technology.

==Student Training==

LULI trains French and foreign undergraduate and graduate students in plasma physics and laser physics and technology  [http://www.ecoledoctorale.polytechnique.fr].

'''Language delay''' is a failure in [[children]] to develop [[language]] abilities on the usual [[age-appropriate]] for their [[developmental timetable]]. It is most common during the ages of 2 to 7 years and can sometimes continue into late childhood.  Language delay is distinct from [[speech delay]], in which the development of the [[Manner of articulation|mechanical and motor aspects of speech production]] is delayed.

Communication is a two-stage process.  The first stage is to encode the message into a set of words (or signs in the case of Sign Languages) and sentence structures that convey the required meaning, i.e. into language. In the second stage, language is translated into motor commands that control the articulators (hands, face, body, lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc.), thereby creating language.

Because language and speech are independent, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech
(i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language because they use a Sign Language or other means of communication.

{{anchor|receptive|expressive}}Language delay is commonly divided into ''receptive'' and ''expressive'' categories. [[Receptive language]] refers to the process of understanding language.  [[Expressive language]] refers to the use of sentences (made of words or signs) to communicate messages to others.  Both categories are essential to effective communication.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Language delay is a [[risk factor]] for other types of developmental delay, including social, emotional, and cognitive delay. Even though speech and language delays may affect a smaller portion of the population in children, it still can have an incredible impact on their life and their accomplishments in the future. Some of these include problems with behavior, difficulty with reading, and other issues related to spelling and low IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Screening for speech and language delay in preschool children: Recommendation statement|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-in-preschool-children-screening|journal=Pediatrics|volume=117|issue=2|pages=497-501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children may grow out of these deficits, even coming to excel where they once lagged, while others do not. One particularly common result of language delay is delayed or inadequate acquisition of [[reading (activity)|reading]] skills. Reading depends upon an ability to code and decode script (i.e., match speech sounds with symbols, and vice versa). If a child is still struggling to master language and speech, it is very difficult to learn another level of complexity (writing). Thus, it is crucial that children have facility with language to be successful readers.

Neuroscientist [[Steven Pinker]] postulates that a certain form of language delay may be associated with exceptional and innate analytical prowess in some individuals, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Steven| last=Pinker| title=His Brain Measured Up| url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=24 June 1999| accessdate=2006-12-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| archivedate=11 December 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Language delays are the most frequent [[developmental delay]]s, and can occur for many reasons. A delay can be due to being a “[[late bloomer]]”, “[[late talker]]”, or a more serious problem. The most common causes of speech delay include
* Hearing loss
* Slow development
* [[Intellectual disability]]

Such delays can occur in conjunction with a lack of mirroring of [[facial response]]s, unresponsiveness or unawareness of certain [[noise]]s, a lack of interest in playing with other children or toys, or no pain response to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |title=Language Learning Styles |date=August 2013 |publisher=TLG |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823095038/http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |archivedate=23 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Autism_Resource_Center/FAQ.aspx| publisher=American Academy of Children &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry| accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes include:
* [[Psychosocial deprivation]] - The child doesn't spend enough time communicating with adults, such as babbling and joint attention. Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Committee on Public Education |title=Media education |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=341–3 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10429023 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/2/341.long |doi=10.1542/peds.104.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Television]] viewing is associated with delayed language development. Children who watched television alone were 8.47 times more likely to have language delay when compared to children who interacted with their caregivers during television viewing.&lt;ref name="Chonchaiya 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chonchaiya| first1=W| last2=Pruksananonda| first2=C |title=Television viewing associates with delayed language development |journal=[[Acta Paediatrica]] |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=977–82 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18460044 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00831.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some educational television shows, such as Blue's Clues, have been found to enhance a child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], children under the age of 2 should watch no television at all, and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged, especially television shows with no educational value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance. However, in a study conducted by Dr. Birken of the Hospital for Sick Children, it was found that watching television while interacting with a parent of caregiver is actually beneficial for children who are bilingual. The study spanned four years, from 2011 to 2015, and was based on parent report and clinician observation. Over the four years it was found that if a bilingual child had interaction with an adult while watching television they did not suffer language delay and it in fact helped them develop English, their second language. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Akpan |first1=N |title=Toddler's Screen Time Linked to Slower Speech Development |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/toddlers-screen-time-linked-slower-speech-development-study-finds |website=PBS |publisher=PBS |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gender and how each gender uses technology can also impact a child's language development. The use of handheld electronics in addition to television differs between boys and girls. A survey done in 2014 in the UK by Ofcom showed that 21% of girls ages 3-4 used handheld electronics whereas 30% of boys ages 3-4 used handheld electronics. From this study, the results show that gender provides a gap between the usage of electronics when comparing boys and girls, even though they are the same age. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kucirkova|first=Natalia|last2=Littleton|first2=Karen|last3=Kyparissiadis|first3=Antonios|date=2017-01-03|title=The influence of children's gender and age on children's use of digital media at home|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12543|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=545–559|doi=10.1111/bjet.12543|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stress during pregnancy is associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid17355398"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talge| first1=NM| last2=Neal| first2=C| last3=Glover| first3=V |title=Antenatal maternal stress and long-term effects on child neurodevelopment: how and why? |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=48 |issue=3-4 |pages=245–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17355398 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01714.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being a twin or a younger sibling increases the chance of speech and language delays. Reasons for this are thought to include less one-on-one time with parents, premature birth with twins, and the companionship of their twin sibling reducing their motivation to talk to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twinpickle.com/2017/11/07/do-twins-talk-to-each-other/|title=Do Twins Talk to Each Other in a Secret Language?|date=2017-11-07|work=Twin Pickle|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With being a younger sibling, it can also be linked to less one on one time with their parents or guardians. Older siblings also tend to talk for their younger siblings, giving them less opportunities to grow their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turnbull |first1=Khara |last2=Justice |first2=Laura |title=Language Development from Theory to Practice |date=2017 |publisher=Pearson |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]{{fact|date=December 2016}}
* [[Autism]] (a developmental disorder) - There is strong evidence that autism is commonly associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid16608544"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miniscalco| first1=C| last2=Nygren| first2=G| last3=Hagberg| first3=B| last4=Kadesjö| first4=B| last5=Gillberg| first5=C |title=Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at age 6 and 7 years who screened positive for language problems at 30 months |journal=[[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |date=May 2006 |doi=10.1017/S0012162206000788| pmid=16608544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19713073"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagberg BS, Miniscalco C, Gillberg C |title=Clinic attenders with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: cognitive profile at school age and its relationship to preschool indicators of language delay |journal=[[Research in Developmental Disabilities]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19713073 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asperger syndrome]], which is on the autistic spectrum, however, is not associated with language delay.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selective mutism]] (an anxiety disorder that is expressed by loss of speech)
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (a movement disorder caused by brain damage)
* Genetic abnormalities - In 2005, researchers found a connection between expressive language delay and a genetic abnormality: a duplicate set of the same genes that are missing in sufferers of [[Williams-Beuren syndrome]]. Also so called [[XYY syndrome]] can often cause speech delay.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/47xyy-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;
* Correlation with male sex, previous family history, and maternal education has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell| first1=T F| last2=Dollaghan| first2=C A| last3=Rockette| first3=H E| last4=Paradise| first4=J L| last5=Feldman| first5=H M| last6=Shriberg| first6=L D| last7=Sabo| first7=D L| last8=Kurs-Lasky| first8=M| title=Risk factors for speech delay of unknown origin in 3-year-old children| journal=[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]| date=2002| volume=74| issue=2| pages=346–57| pmid=12705559| url=http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/phonology/pubs/PUB18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Studies have failed to find clear evidence that a language delay can be prevented by training or educating health care professionals in the subject. Overall, some of the reviews show positive results regarding interventions in language delay, but are not curative.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary - Early Identification of Language Delays, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
To treat an already existing language delay a child would need Speech and Language Therapy to correct any deficits. These therapists can be found in schools, clinics, through home care agencies, and also colleges where Communication Sciences and Disorders are studied. Aside from these, it is still encouraged for the child's parent to get involved. A few ways that a parent could get involved with helping to  improve a child’s language and speech skills includes speaking to their child with enthusiasm, engaging in conversations revolving what the child is focusing on, and reading to their child frequently. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/|title=When to worry if a child has too few words|last1=Klass|first1=Perri|date=2010|website=The Hamilton Spectator|publisher=The Hamilton Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social and play skills appear to be more difficult for children with language delays due to their decreased experience in conversation. [[Speech pathologist|Speech Pathologists]] utilize methods such as prompting to improve a child's social skills through play intervention. While recent studies have consistently found play intervention to be helpful, further research is required in order to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sualy|first=Abbey|last2=Yount|first2=Sara|last3=Kelly-Vance|first3=Lisa|last4=Ryalls|first4=Brigette|date=2011|title=Using a play intervention to improve the play skills of children with a language delay|url=https://web-a-ebscohost-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=d05a7084-3661-4cd4-bbde-065956fef94a%40sessionmgr4009|journal=International Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=105-122|via=PsychINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'' defines '''music criticism''' as 'the intellectual activity of formulating judgements on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres'.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is a branch of [[musical aesthetics]]. With the concurrent expansion of interest in music and information media over the past century, the term has come to acquire the conventional meaning of journalistic reporting on musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of music criticism==

The musicologist [[Winton Dean]] has suggested that "music is probably the most difficult of the arts to criticize."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 44&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[plastic arts|plastic]] or literary arts, the 'language' of music does not specifically relate to human sensory experience - Dean's words, "the word 'love' is common coin in life and literature: the note C has nothing to do with breakfast or railway journeys or marital harmony."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Like dramatic art, music is recreated at every performance, and criticism may therefore be directed both at the text (musical score) and the performance. More specifically, as music has a temporal dimension that requires repetition or development of its material "problems of balance, contrast, expectation and fulfilment ... are more central to music than to other arts, supported as these are by verbal or representational content."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a clearly evolved or consensual musical aesthetics has also tended to make music criticism a highly subjective issue. "There is no counter-check outside the critic's own personality."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===To end of 18th century===
Critical references to music (often deprecating performers or styles) can be found in early literature, including, for example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' and in the writings of medieval music theorists.

According to [[Richard Taruskin]], the active concert life of late 18th-century London meant that "the role and the function of arts criticism as we know it today were the creations of the English public."&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 571.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first magazines specifically devoted to music criticism seem to have developed in Germany, for example [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]'s ''Der getreue Music-Meister'' (1728), which included publications of new compositions, and ''Der critische Musikus'' which appeared in [[Hamburg]] between 1737 and 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in the 1750s, the [[Querelle des Bouffons]] (the dispute between supporters of French and Italian opera styles as represented by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] respectively) generated essays from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, including [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010), 441-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The English composer [[Charles Avison]] (1709–1770) published the first work on musical criticism in the English language - an ''Essay on Musical Expression'' published in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Bujic (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Avison claims that since the time of [[Palestrina]] and [[Raphael]], music had improved in status whilst pictorial art had declined.&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he believes that [[George Frideric Handel]] is too much concerned with naturalistic imitation than with expression,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 37&lt;/ref&gt; and criticises the habit, in [[Italian opera]]s, of &lt;blockquote&gt;'that egregious absurdity of repeating, and finishing many songs with the first part; when it often happens, after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed, that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second, and, therefore, should conclude the performance.'&lt;ref&gt;Avison (1752), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Typically until the late eighteenth century music criticism centred on vocal rather than instrumental music - "vocal music ... was the apex of [the] aesthetic hierarchy. One knew what music was expressing."&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2003) 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Romanticism===
The last years of the eighteenth century reflected both a change of patronage of music from the aristocracy to the rising middle-classes&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012), 11-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Romanticism]] in the arts. Both of these had consequences for the practice of music criticism; "the tone of the critic was lowered as his audience expanded: he began to approach the reader as a colleague rather than a pedagogue,"&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and a new generation of critics began to widen their consideration to other aspects of music than its pure representative aspects, becoming increasingly interested in instrumental music. Prominent amongst these was [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], who wrote in 1809&lt;blockquote&gt;That instrumental music has now risen to a level of which one probably had no inkling not long ago, and that the [[symphony]], especially following...Haydn and Mozart, has become the ultimate form of instrumental music - the ''opera'' of instruments, as it were - all this is well-known to every music-lover.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann (2003) 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further impetus to the direction of music criticism was given by the changing nature of concert programming with the establishment of the European classical music canon; indeed it is at this period that the word 'classical' is first applied to a received musical tradition. At the same time, the proportion of new music to 'canonic' music in concert programming began to decline, meaning that living composers were increasingly in competition with their dead predecessors. This was particularly the case in respect of the rise of [[Beethoven]]'s reputation in his last year and posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2012) 50-1; Weber (2001); Weber (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise both to writings on the value of the 'canon' and also to writings by composers and their supporters defending newer music.

In 1798 the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', edited by [[Friedrich Rochlitz]] (1769-1842), began publication in [[Leipzig]], and this is often regarded as the precursor of a new genre of criticism aimed at a wider readership than qualified connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (2010) 673.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years a number of regular journals dedicated to music criticism and reviews began to appear in major European centres, including ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' (London 1823-33), ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (London, 1844-date), the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' (Paris 1827-1880, founded by [[François-Joseph Fétis]]), the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' founded in 1825 by [[Adolf Martin Schlesinger|A.M. Schlesinger]] and edited by [[Adolf Bernhard Marx|A. B. Marx]], and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded in 1834 in Leipzig by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Friedrich Wieck]], and later edited by [[Franz Brendel]]. Other journals at this period also began to carry extensive writings on music: [[Hector Berlioz]] wrote for the Parisian ''[[Journal des débats]]'', [[Heinrich Heine]] reported on music and literature in Paris for the Stuttgart ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the young [[Richard Wagner]] wrote articles for [[Heinrich Laube]]'s magazine ''Zeitung für die elegante Welt'' and during his 1839-42 stay in Paris for Schlesinger's publishing house and for German newspapers. In 1835 [[James William Davison]] (1813–85) began his lifelong career as a music critic, writing 40 years for ''[[The Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;Davison (1912) v.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music lessons''' are a type of formal instruction in playing a [[musical instrument]] or [[singing]]. Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-on-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years. For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head, chest, and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills. While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar. Since the widespread availability of high speed. low latency [[Internet]], private lessons can also take place through live video chat using [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s and [[videotelephony]] online.

Music lessons are part of both amateur music instruction and professional training. In amateur and recreational music contexts, children and adults take music lessons to improve their singing or instrumental playing skills and learn basic to intermediate techniques. In professional training contexts, such as music conservatories, university music performance programs (e.g., [[Bachelor of music]], [[Master of music]], [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]], etc.), students aiming for a career as professional musicians take a music lesson once a week for an hour or more with a music professor over a period of years to learn advanced playing or singing techniques. Many instrumental performers and singers, including a number of [[pop music]] celebrities, have learned music "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]", especially in [[folk music]] styles such as [[blues]] and popular styles such as [[rock music]]. Nevertheless, even in folk and popular styles, a number of performers have had some type of music lessons, such as meeting with a [[vocal coach]] or getting childhood instruction in an instrument such as piano.

For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. For wind and brass instruments, the teacher shows the student how to use their lips, tongue, and breath to produce tones and sounds. For some instruments, teachers also train students in the use of the feet, as in the case of piano or other keyboard instruments that have damper or sustain pedals on the piano, the [[pedal keyboard]] on a [[pipe organ]], and some drums and cymbals in the [[drum kit]] such as the bass drum pedal and the hi-hat cymbal pedal. In addition to teaching fingering, teachers also provide other types of instruction. A [[guitar]] player learns how to strum and pluck strings; players of [[wind instrument]]s learn about breath control and [[embouchure]], and [[singer]]s learn how to make the most of their [[vocal cords]] without hurting the throat or vocal cords.

Teachers also show students how to achieve the correct posture for most efficient playing results. For all instruments, the best way to move the fingers and arms to achieve a desired effect is to learn to play with the least tension in your hands and body.  This also prevents forming habits that can injure the skeletal frame and muscles.  For example, when playing the [[piano]], ''fingering''—which fingers to put on which keys—is a skill slowly learned as the student advances, and there are many standard techniques a teacher can pass on.

There are many myths and misconceptions among music teachers, especially in the Western classical tradition, about "good" posture and "bad" posture. Students who find that playing their instruments causes them physical pain should bring this to their teachers' attention. It could be a potentially serious health risk, but it is often overlooked when learning to play an instrument. Learning to use one's body in a manner consistent with the way their anatomy is designed to work can mean the difference between a crippling injury and a lifetime of enjoyment. Many music teachers would caution students about taking "no pain, no gain" as an acceptable response from their music teacher regarding a complaint of physical pain.  Concerns about use-related injury and the [[ergonomics]] of musicianship have gained more mainstream acceptance in recent years. Musicians have increasingly been turning to medical professionals, physical therapists, and specialized techniques seeking relief from pain and prevention of serious injury. There exists a plurality of special techniques for an even greater plurality of potential difficulties. The [[Alexander Technique]] is just one example of these specialized approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/musichaz.txt Occupational Hazards In Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and history ==
To fully understand [[music]] being played, the student must learn the basics of the underlying [[music theory]]. Along with [[musical notation]], students learn rhythmic techniques—like controlling [[tempo]], recognizing [[time signature]]s, and the theory of [[harmony]], including [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[key signature]]s. In addition to basic theory, a good teacher stresses ''musicality'', or how to make the music sound good. This includes how to create good, pleasing tone, how to do musical phrasing, and how to use [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness) to make the piece or song more expressive.

Most music lessons include some instruction in the history of the type of music that the student is learning. When a student is taking Western [[classical music]] lessons, music teachers often spend some time explaining the different eras of western classical music, such as the [[Baroque Era]], the [[Classical period music|Classical]] era, the [[Romantic Era]], and the [[contemporary classical music era]], because each era is associated with different styles of music and different [[performance practice]] techniques. Instrumental music from the Baroque era is often played in the 2000s as teaching pieces for piano students, string instrument players, and wind instrument players. If students just try to play these Baroque pieces by reading the notes from the score, they might not get the right type of interpretation. However, once a student learns that most Baroque instrumental music was associated with dances, such as the [[gavotte]] and the [[sarabande]], and keyboard music from the Baroque era was played on the [[harpsichord]] or the pipe organ, a modern-day student is better able to understand how the piece should be played. If, for example, a [[cello]] player is assigned a gavotte that was originally written for harpsichord, this gives the student insight in how to play the piece. Since it is a dance, it should have a regular, clear pulse, rather than a Romantic era-style shifting [[tempo rubato]]. As well, since it was originally written for the harpsichord, a light-sounding keyboard instrument in which the strings are plucked with quills, this suggests that the notes should be played relatively lightly, and with spaces between each note, rather than in a full-bodied, sustained [[legato]].

== Technical exercises ==
Although not universally accepted, many teachers drill students with the repetitive playing of certain patterns, such as [[scale (music)|scales]], [[arpeggio]]s, and [[rhythm]]s. Scales are often taught because they are the building blocks of melody in most Western art music. In addition, there are flexibility studies, which make it physically easier to play the instrument. 
Percussion instruments use rudiments that help in the development of sticking patterns, roll techniques and other little nuances such as flams and drags.

There are sets of exercises for piano designed to stretch the connection between fourth and fifth fingers, making them more independent. Brass players practice ''lip slurs'', which are unarticulated changes in [[embouchure]] between [[Harmonic series (music)#Terminology|partial]]s.  Woodwind players (Saxophone, Clarinet, and Flute) have a multitude of exercises to help with tonguing techniques, finger dexterity, and tone development. Entire books of [[etude]]s have been written to this purpose.

== Pieces ==
Teachers typically assign the student pieces (or songs for vocal students) of slowly increasing difficulty. Besides using pieces to teach various musical rudiments (rhythm, harmony, pitch, etc.) and teach the elements of good playing (or singing) style, a good teacher also inspires more intangible qualities—such as expressiveness and musicianship. Pieces (or songs) are more enjoyable for most students than theory or scale exercises, and an emphasis on learning new pieces is usually required to maintain students' motivation. However, the teacher must not over-accommodate a student's desire for "fun" pieces.  Often the student's idea of fun music is popular vocal selections, movie soundtracks, and [[TV show]] theme songs, etc. While some of these "fun" pieces can be performed, pieces should also be selected for pedagogical reasons, such as challenging the student and honing their skills. Student should learn something from every piece they play.  In addition, for students to be well rounded they must play many types of pieces by composers and songwriters from different eras, ranging from [[Renaissance music]] to pieces from the 20th and 21st century.  A varied repertoire increases the student's musical understanding and skill.

== Examinations ==
A popular measure of progress, especially for children, is external assessment of the progress of the pupil by a regular [[music examination|examination]].  A number of exam boards assess pupils on music theory or practice.  These are available for almost every musical instrument. A common method to mark progress is graded examinations—for example from grade 1 (beginner) to grade 8 (ready to enter higher study at music school).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiceducationmadness.org/lesson_plans-shtml/ Lesson Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers prefer other methods of target-setting for their pupils.  The most common is the pupil's concert, which gives experience in playing in public and under a certain degree of pressure, without outright criticism or a more or less arbitrary marking system.  Another is the graded system of books followed by teachers of the [[Suzuki method]], in which the completion of each book is celebrated, without a system of marking or ranking of pupils.

== Extra-musical benefits ==
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, La Leçon de musique (1710).jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Jean-Marc Nattier]], ''The music lesson'', (1711)]]

Some studies suggests that music lessons provide children with important developmental benefits beyond simply the knowledge or skill of playing a musical instrument. Research suggests that musical lessons may enhance intelligence and academic achievement, build self-esteem and improve discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Dianne|title=The Positives of Learning About Music|url=http://www.justmusiclessons.com.au/the-positives-of-learning-about-music/|publisher=Shine Music|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Study found that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical schools, followed by biochemistry and the humanities.  On [[SAT]] tests, the national average scores were 427 on the verbal and 476 on math.  At the same time, music students averaged 465 on the verbal and 497 on the math -  38 and 21 points higher, respectively.{{cn|date=January 2015}}  However, the observed correlation between musical and mathematical ability may be inherent rather than acquired.  Furthermore, it is possible that the correlation between taking music lessons and academic ability exists because both are strongly correlated with parental income and education.  Even if music lessons had no impact on academic ability, one would expect to see a correlation between music lessons and academic ability.

Skills learned through the discipline of music may transfer to [[study skills]], communication skills, and cognitive skills useful in every part of a child's studies at school, though.  An in-depth [[Harvard University]] study found evidence that spatial-temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music, and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music, including Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|title=Music and spatial task performance|journal=Nature|date=14 October 1993|volume=365|issue=611|doi=10.1038/365611a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6447/abs/365611a0.html|accessdate=20 January 2015|pmid=8413624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding (named ''The [[Mozart effect]]'') suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well. However, there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher (e.g. Steele, Bass &amp; Crook, 1999), questioned both theory and methodology of the original study (Fudis &amp; Lembesis 2004) and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal (Thompson, Schellenberg &amp; Husain, 2001).

A relationship between music and the strengthening of [[math]], [[dance]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], creative thinking and visual arts skills has also been reported in [[literature]]. (Winner, Hetland, Sanni, as reported in ''The Arts and Academic Achievement - What the Evidence Shows'', 2000) However recent findings by Dr. Levitin of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], undermines the suggested connection between musical ability and higher math skills. In a study conducted on patients with [[Williams syndrome]] (a genetic disorder causing low intelligence), he found that even though their [[intelligence]] was that of young children, they still possessed an unusually high level of musical ability.

The '''National Institute for Environmental Studies''' (''NIES'':国立環境研究所, Kokuritsu-Kankyō kenkyūsho) was established in 1974 as a focal point for environmental research in Japan. In 2001 it became an [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. 
NIES is organised into eight centers, each of which is subdivided into a further number of sections responsible for different specializations within the broader field to which they belong.
The eight centers are responsible for research in eight different fields, with programs dedicated to these research areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nies.go.jp/fields/index-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Neurath's boat''' is a [[simile]] used in [[anti-foundationalism|anti-foundational]] accounts of [[knowledge]], especially in the [[philosophy of science]], which was first formulated by [[Otto Neurath]]. It is based in part on the [[Ship of Theseus]] which, however, is standardly used to illustrate other philosophical questions, to do with problems of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960).

==Different versions==
Neurath used the simile in several occasions,&lt;ref name=ONPSP/&gt;&lt;ref name=antispengler&gt;{{cite book |last=Neurath |first=Otto |title=Anti-Spengler |year=1921 |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-2525-6_6 |isbn=978-90-277-0259-3 |at=Vienna Circle Collection vol. 1: ''Empiricism and Sociology'' (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being in Neurath's text ''Problems in War Economics''.

{{quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.}}

[[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]], in his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', refers to it as a '''Neurathian bootstrap''' and uses it as an analogy to the [[recursion|recursive]] nature of revising one's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). ''The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin'' (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A "rotten plank" on the ship, for instance, might refer to a [[meme|meme virus]] or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals). It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

{{quote|"We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [[memeplex]]es (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware..." (p. 181)}}

In this way, one might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more rational.

Smith rebels by entering a forbidden relationship with fellow employee [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]].

As literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[doublethink]]'', ''[[thoughtcrime]]'', ''[[Newspeak]]'', ''[[Room 101]]'', ''[[telescreen]]'', ''[[2 + 2 = 5]]'', and ''[[memory hole]]'', have entered into common usage since its publication in 1949. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' popularised the adjective ''[[Orwellian]]'', which connotes official deception, secret surveillance, brazenly misleading terminology and manipulation of recorded history by a [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[[Lev Grossman|Grossman, Lev]]; Lacayo, Richard (6 October 2005).

==History and title==
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four manuscript.jpg|thumb|A 1947 draft manuscript of the first page of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', showing the editorial development.]]

Orwell "encapsulate[d] the thesis at the heart of his unforgiving novel" in 1944, the implications of dividing the world up into zones of influence, which had been conjured by the [[Tehran Conference]]. Three years later, he wrote most of it on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] from 1947 to 1948 despite being seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Roger Senhouse, 26 December 1948, reprinted in ''Collected Works:It Is What I Think, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, Chapter 18. "thesis": pp. 368–69&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December 1948, he sent the final manuscript to the publisher [[Secker and Warburg]], and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was published on 8 June 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowker|2003|pp=383, 399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|title=Charles' George Orwell Links|publisher=Netcharles.com|accessdate=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093026/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, it had been translated into 65 languages, more than any other novel in English until then.&lt;ref name=translations&gt;John Rodden. ''The Politics of Literary Reputation: The Making and Claiming of "St. George" Orwell''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the novel, its themes, the ''[[Newspeak]]'' language and the author's surname are often invoked against control and intrusion by the state, and the adjective ''[[wikt:Orwellian|Orwellian]]'' describes a totalitarian dystopia that is characterised by government control and subjugation of the people.

Orwell's invented language, Newspeak, satirises hypocrisy and evasion by the state: the [[Ministry of Love]] (Miniluv) oversees torture and brainwashing, the [[Ministry of Plenty]] (Miniplenty) oversees shortage and rationing, the [[Ministry of Peace]] (Minipax) oversees war and atrocity and the [[Ministry of Truth]] (Minitrue) oversees propaganda and historical revisionism.

''The Last Man in Europe'' was an early title for the novel, but in a letter dated 22 October 1948 to his publisher [[Fredric Warburg]], eight months before publication, Orwell wrote about hesitating between that title and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref&gt;CEJL, iv, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Warburg suggested choosing the main title to be the latter, a more commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. Introduction to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1978 novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', English author [[Anthony Burgess]] suggests that Orwell, disillusioned by the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–91), intended to call the book ''1948''. The introduction to the [[Penguin Books]] Modern Classics edition of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' reports that Orwell originally set the novel in 1980 but that he later shifted the date to 1982 and then to 1984. The introduction to the [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] edition of ''Animal Farm and 1984'' (2003) reports that the title ''1984'' was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed, and that the date was meant to give an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;Introduction to ''Animal Farm and 1984'' by Christopher Hitchens, {{ISBN|978-0-15-101026-4}}; p. x (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its publication history, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' has been either banned or legally [[challenge (literature)|challenged]], as subversive or ideologically corrupting, like the [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novels ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1924) by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]], ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) by [[Arthur Koestler]], ''[[Kallocain]]'' (1940) by [[Karin Boye]] and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953) by [[Ray Bradbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcus |first1=Laura |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |year=2005 |title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century English Literature |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-82077-4 |page=226 |quote=Brave New World [is] traditionally bracketed with Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' as a dystopia&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers consider the Russian dystopian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by Zamyatin to have influenced ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/freedom-and-happiness-review-of-we-by-yevgeny-zamyatin "Freedom and Happiness"] (a review of ''We'' by Yevgeny Zamyatin) by Orwell, ''The Express Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/08/george-orwell-1984-zamyatin-we "1984 thoughtcrime?

==Background==
[[File:Ingsoc logo from 1984.svg|thumb|The banner of the Party in the 1984 film adaptation of the book. Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.

Smith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] became involved in a war fought in [[Europe]], [[European Russia|western Russia]], and [[North America]] during the early 1950s. [[Nuclear weapons]] were used during the war, leading to the destruction of [[Colchester]]. [[London]] would also suffer widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell to civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] was absorbed by the [[United States]] to become Oceania. Eventually Ingsoc emerged to form a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in the country.

Simultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]]. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] would emerge in the [[Far East]] after several decades of fighting. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in "a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and [[Hong Kong]]" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues in order to maintain ideological control over the people.

However, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of history, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unclear. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, airplanes and trains, while Julia theorizes that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring "confused street fighting in London itself" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls "the Revolution".

Most of the plot takes place in London, the "chief city of [[Airstrip One]]", the Oceanic province that "had once been called England or Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while the ubiquitous ''telescreen'' ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitors the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.

The class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:
* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.
* (II) the middle-class [[Outer Party]], who make up 13% of the population.
* (III) the lower-class [[Proles|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the uneducated working class.
As the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries:
* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defense.
* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (rationing and starvation).
* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).
* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).

The protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising historical records]], to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'', people who have been "vaporised", i.e., not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory.

The story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen." Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.&lt;ref&gt;"striking thirteen" (1:00&amp;nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1984, civilization has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the "Party" under the ideology of "[[Ingsoc]]" and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).

Winston Smith is a member of the middle class [[Outer Party]]. He works at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become "unpersons", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a "[[memory hole]]". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion. He realizes that he is already a "[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]" and likely to be caught one day.

While in a proletarian neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]].

The next day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note confessing her love for him, which simply reads, ''"I love you."'' Winston and Julia begin a torrid affair, an act of the rebellion as the Party insists that sex may only be used for reproduction. Winston realizes that she shares his loathing of the Party. They first meet in the country, and later in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his ex-wife Katharine. Winston also interacts with his colleague Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the [[English language]] called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme admits that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston speculates that Syme will disappear. Not long after, Syme disappears and no one acknowledges his absence.

Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who offers Winston a chance to join the Brotherhood. They arrange a meeting at O'Brien's luxurious flat where both Winston and Julia swear allegiance to the Brotherhood. He sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if "proles" (proletarians) rise up against it.

Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are captured in the shop and imprisoned in the [[Ministry of Love]]. O'Brien reveals that he is actually loyal to the Party, and was simply part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch "thoughtcriminals". Over many months, Winston is tortured and forced to "cure" himself of his "insanity" by changing his own perception to fit the Party line, even if it requires believing that "[[2 + 2 = 5]]". O'Brien openly admits that the Party "is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power." He says that once Winston is brainwashed into loyalty, he will be released back into society for a period of time, before they execute him. O'Brien states that Winston and others who do not love the party will be shot in the back of the head after being released.  Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia.

O'Brien then takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear, in Winston's case rats. As a wire cage holding hungry rats is fitted onto his face, Winston shouts "Do it to Julia!", thus betraying her. After being released, Winston meets Julia in a park. She says that she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. Winston realizes that he and Julia no longer feel for one another and that the Party has even managed to take away their love. Later, Winston sits alone in a café as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasian]] armies in Africa, and, successfully brainwashed, realizes that "He loved Big Brother."

==Characters==
===Main characters===
[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]
* [[Winston Smith]]&amp;nbsp;– the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.
*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&amp;nbsp;– Winston's lover who is a covert "[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.
* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&amp;nbsp;– a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, in order to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.

===Secondary characters===
* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&amp;nbsp;– former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.
* Ampleforth&amp;nbsp;– Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word "God" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for "rod";{{refn|This may be a reference to "[[McAndrew's Hymn]]", which includes the lines "From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God— / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs In on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.
* Charrington&amp;nbsp;– an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.
* Katharine Smith&amp;nbsp;– the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston "can't get rid of". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their "duty to the Party". Although she was a "goodthinkful" ideologue, they separated because she could not have children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be "got rid of" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.
* Tom Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Winston's naïve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, hearing him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do "good work" in the hard labour camps.
* Mrs. Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.
** The Parsons children&amp;nbsp;– members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.
* Syme&amp;nbsp;– Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that "He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly." Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.

===Unseen characters===
Whether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:
* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&amp;nbsp;– the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.
* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&amp;nbsp;– ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]—the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.

==World in novel==
===Ingsoc===
{{Main article|Ingsoc}}
Ingsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents.

===Ministries of Oceania===
{{Main article|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
In London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the façades of which display the Party's three slogans. The ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: "The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation." (Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')

====Ministry of Peace====
The [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ministry of Plenty====
The [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability, and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current, "increased rations".

====Ministry of Truth====
The [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), "rectifying" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.

====Ministry of Love====
The [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests, and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face "the worst thing in the world"—until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.

===Doublethink===
{{Main article|Doublethink}}
{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}

===Political geography===
{{Main article|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]
Three perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"&gt;Part II, Ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. [[English Socialism]]), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and [[Southern Africa]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and [[Russia]], including [[Siberia]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]

The perpetual war is fought for control of the "disputed area" lying "between the frontiers of the super-states", which forms "a rough parallelogram with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Hong Kong]]",&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"/&gt; and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.

Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that the superstates' ideologies are alike and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing in the detestability of the opposing ideologies. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in "the war".

===The Revolution===
{{Main article|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}
Winston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after "a decade of confused fighting". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.

The annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.

While the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganization occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack "thirty years" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the "fourth quarter of 1983" was "also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.

===The War===
{{See also|Perpetual war}}
In 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].

That alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from "Eurasia" to "Eastasia" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured Africa.

Goldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).

===Living standards===
The society of Airstrip One and, according to "The Book", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality "luxuries" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the "Victory" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made "Victory" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[War of the Atlantic]].)

Winston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.

In contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and "The Book" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, "The Book" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only "relatively" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary élite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. "The Book" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or "reintegration" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that "the future belonged to the proles".&lt;ref&gt;Lines 29–35, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: "The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill".&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and "The Book" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Themes==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===Nationalism===
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay "[[Notes on Nationalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: "Notes on Nationalism"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces. In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the Party's artificial, minimalist language 'Newspeak' addresses the matter.
* Positive nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual love for Big Brother; Neo-Toryism and [[Celtic nationalism]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by love.
* Negative nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual hatred for Emmanuel Goldstein; [[Stalinism]] and  [[Anglophobia]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by hatred.
* Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.

O'Brien concludes: "The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power."

===Futurology===
In the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.|Part III, Chapter III, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''}}

===Censorship===
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four cover by Penguin.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 21st-century printing by [[Penguin Books]] with an intentionally censored cover]]
A major theme of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is censorship, especially in the Ministry of Truth, where photographs are modified and public archives rewritten to rid them of "unpersons" (persons who are erased from history by the Party). On the telescreens, figures for all types of production are grossly exaggerated or simply invented to indicate an ever-growing economy, when the reality is the opposite. One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about Comrade Ogilvy, a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.

===Surveillance===
The inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.

==Newspeak appendix==
{{Main article|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}
"The Principles of Newspeak" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making "all other modes of thought impossible". (A linguistic theory about how language may direct thought is the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].)

Whether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: "Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised" p.&amp;nbsp;422). Some critics (Atwood,&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Atwood]]: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/16/georgeorwell.artsfeatures "Orwell and me"]. ''The Guardian'' 16 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Benstead,&lt;ref&gt;Benstead, James (26 June 2005).

==Sources for literary motifs==
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' uses themes from life in the Soviet Union and wartime life in Great Britain as sources for many of its motifs. Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement "[[2 + 2 = 5]]", used to torment Winston Smith during his interrogation, was a communist party slogan from the second [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]], which encouraged fulfillment of the five-year plan in four years. The slogan was seen in electric lights on Moscow house-fronts, billboards and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The Forsaken"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia | publisher=Penguin Press | last=Tzouliadis |first=Tim | year=2008 | location=New York | isbn=978-1-59420-168-4 | pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch of Oceania's allegiance from Eastasia to Eurasia and the subsequent rewriting of history ("Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped—including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). "The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Matt.

The description of Emmanuel Goldstein, with a "small, goatee beard", evokes the image of [[Leon Trotsky]]. The film of Goldstein during the Two Minutes Hate is described as showing him being transformed into a bleating sheep. This image was used in a propaganda film during the [[Kinoks|Kino-eye]] period of Soviet film, which showed Trotsky transforming into a goat.&lt;ref name="Kino-eye"&gt;{{cite book | title=Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov | publisher=University of California Press | last=Vertov |first=Dziga | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-520-05630-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein's book is similar to Trotsky's highly critical analysis of the USSR, ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'', published in 1936.

The omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up around [[Joseph Stalin]].

The news in Oceania emphasised production figures, just as it did in the Soviet Union, where record-setting in factories (by "[[Hero of Socialist Labour|Heroes of Socialist Labor]]") was especially glorified. The best known of these was [[Alexey Stakhanov]], who purportedly set a record for coal mining in 1935.

The tortures of the Ministry of Love evoke the procedures used by the [[NKVD]] in their interrogations,&lt;ref name="NKVD tortures"&gt;{{cite book | last=Senyonovna |first=Eugenia | title=Journey into the Whirlwind | year=1967 | publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of rubber truncheons, being forbidden to put your hands in your pockets, remaining in brightly lit rooms for days, torture through the use of their greatest fear, and the victim being shown a mirror after their physical collapse.

The random bombing of Airstrip One is based on the [[V-1 flying bomb|Buzz bombs]] and the [[V-2 rocket]], which struck England at random in 1944–1945.

The [[Thought Police]] is based on the [[NKVD]], which arrested people for random "anti-soviet" remarks.&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Sheila |title=Everyday Stalinism |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thought Crime motif is drawn from [[Kempeitai]], the Japanese wartime secret police, who arrested people for "unpatriotic" thoughts.

The confessions of the "Thought Criminals" Rutherford, Aaronson and Jones are based on the [[show trial]]s of the 1930s, which included fabricated confessions by prominent Bolsheviks [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] to the effect that they were being paid by the Nazi government to undermine the Soviet regime under [[Leon Trotsky]]'s direction.

The song "[[Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree]]" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me") was based on an old English song called "Go no more a-rushing" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing "chest", and touching your head when you sing "nut"). [[Glenn Miller]] recorded the song in 1939.&lt;ref name="go-no-more--a-rushing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiGONORUSH;ttGONORUSH.html |title=Go No More a-Rushing (Riddle Song) |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hates" (Two Minutes Hate and Hate Week) were inspired by the constant rallies sponsored by party organs throughout the Stalinist period. These were often short pep-talks given to workers before their shifts began (Two Minutes Hate), but could also last for days, as in the annual celebrations of the anniversary of the [[October revolution]] (Hate Week).

Orwell fictionalized "newspeak", "doublethink", and "Ministry of Truth" as evinced by both the Soviet press and that of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUl3Od-xWn8C&amp;pg=PA9|title=Thank you, comrade Stalin!

Winston Smith's job, "revising history" (and the "unperson" motif) are based on the Stalinist habit of airbrushing images of 'fallen' people from group photographs and removing references to them in books and newspapers.&lt;ref name="commisar_vanishes"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=David |title=The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan / Holt |year=1997 |isbn=0-8050-5294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one well-known example, the Soviet encyclopaedia had an article about [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

Big Brother's "Orders of the Day" were inspired by Stalin's regular wartime orders, called by the same name. A small collection of the more political of these have been published (together with his wartime speeches) in English as "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union" By Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref name="on_the_patriotic_war"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Languages Press |last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1944 | location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sample_Order_of_the_day"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1942/05/01.htm | title=Order of the Day, No. 130, May 1st, 1942 | accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Big Brother's Orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals,&lt;ref name="Beijing_edition"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Language Press&amp;nbsp;– Peking | last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to 'rectify' (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day.

The Ingsoc slogan "Our new, happy life", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became a [[CPSU]] slogan, "Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful."&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"/&gt;

In 1940 Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] published [[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]] which described the invention by a "benevolent secret society" of a world that would seek to remake human language and reality along human-invented lines. The story concludes with an appendix describing the success of the project. Borges' story addresses similar themes of [[epistemology]], language and history to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHnFubqgiyoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206|title=Twentieth-century Spanish American Literature to 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
During [[World War II]], Orwell believed that [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British democracy]] as it existed before 1939 would not survive the war. The question being "Would it end via Fascist ''coup d'état'' from above or via Socialist revolution from below"?{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, he admitted that events proved him wrong: "What really matters is that I fell into the trap of assuming that 'the war and the revolution are inseparable'."&lt;ref&gt;"London Letter to Partisan Review, December 1944, quoted from vol. 3 of the Penguin edition of the ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) share themes of the betrayed revolution, the person's subordination to the collective, rigorously enforced class distinctions (Inner Party, Outer Party, Proles), the [[cult of personality]], [[concentration camp]]s, [[Thought Police]], compulsory regimented daily exercise, and youth leagues. [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] resulted from the US annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand. It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses, from which battle is given to recapturing India, the "Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire. Much of Oceanic society is based upon the USSR under [[Joseph Stalin]]—[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. The televised [[Two Minutes Hate]] is ritual demonisation of the [[enemy of the state|enemies of the State]], especially [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] (''viz'' [[Leon Trotsky]]). Altered photographs and newspaper articles create [[unperson]]s deleted from the national historical record, including even founding members of the regime (Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford) in the 1960s purges (''viz'' the [[Great Purges|Soviet Purges]] of the 1930s, in which [[Old Bolshevik|leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution]] were [[Moscow Trials|similarly treated]]). A similar thing also happened during the French Revolution in which many of the original leaders of the Revolution were later put to death, for example [[Georges Danton|Danton]] who was put to death by [[Robespierre]], and then later Robespierre himself met the same fate.

In his 1946 essay "[[Why I Write]]", Orwell explains that the serious works he wrote since the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39) were "written, directly or indirectly, against [[totalitarianism]] and for [[democratic socialism]]".&lt;ref name=aaron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html|title=George Orwell: Why I Write|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a [[cautionary tale]] about revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), while ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'' (1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949). Biographer Michael Shelden notes Orwell's [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] childhood at [[Henley-on-Thames]] as the golden country; being bullied at [[St Cyprian's School]] as his empathy with victims; his life in the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in the [[BBC]] as capricious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelden|first=Michael|year=1991|title=Orwell&amp;nbsp;– The Authorized Biography|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092161-7|pages=430–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influences include ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) and ''The Yogi and the Commissar'' (1945) by [[Arthur Koestler]]; ''[[The Iron Heel]] ''(1908) by [[Jack London]]; ''1920: Dips into the Near Future''&lt;ref&gt;John A. Hobson, [http://ariwatch.com/VS/1920.htm ''1920: Dips into the Near Future'']&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John A. Hobson]]; ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]]; ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1921) by Yevgeny Zamyatin which he reviewed in 1946;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml "Review"], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;br /&gt; paraphrasing [[Rayner Heppenstall]], he reportedly said "that he was taking it as the model for his next novel". Bowker, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Managerial Revolution'' (1940) by [[James Burnham]] predicting perpetual war among three totalitarian superstates. Orwell told [[Jacintha Buddicom]] that he would write a novel stylistically like ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905) by [[H. G. Wells]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Extrapolating from World War II, the novel's [[pastiche]] parallels the politics and rhetoric at war's end—the changed alliances at the "[[Cold War]]'s" (1945–91) beginning; the [[Ministry of Truth]] derives from the BBC's overseas service, controlled by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]; [[Room 101]] derives from a conference room at BBC [[Broadcasting House]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The real room 101|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105132434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archivedate=5 January 2007|accessdate=9 December 2006}}&lt;br /&gt;[[#References|Meyers (2000)]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] of the University of London, containing the Ministry of Information is the architectural inspiration for the Minitrue; the post-war decrepitude derives from the socio-political life of the UK and the US, i.e., the impoverished Britain of 1948 losing its Empire despite newspaper-reported imperial triumph; and war ally but peace-time foe, Soviet Russia became [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]].

The term "English Socialism" has precedents in his wartime writings; in the essay "[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]" (1941), he said that "the war and the revolution are inseparable...&amp;nbsp;the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy"&amp;nbsp;– because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat [[Adolf Hitler]]. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which "will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds). ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Volume 2: "My Country Right or Left" (1940–43; Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', "English Socialism"&amp;nbsp;(or "[[Ingsoc]]" in [[Newspeak]]) is a [[totalitarian]] ideology unlike the English revolution he foresaw. Comparison of the wartime essay "The Lion and the Unicorn" with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' shows that he perceived a Big Brother regime as a perversion of his cherished socialist ideals and English Socialism. Thus Oceania is a corruption of the British Empire he believed would evolve "into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orwell |first=George |authorlink=George Orwell |editor1-last=Orwell |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Angus |editor2-first=Ian |title=George Orwell: the Collected Essays, Journalism &amp; Letters |year=2000 |publisher=Nonpareil Books |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-56792-134-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEgxAJr1REUC&amp;lpg=PA91 |edition=1st Nonpareil |page=91 |quote=The third was to develop a ''positive'' imperial policy, and aim at transforming the Empire into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2013}}

==Critical reception==
When it was first published, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' received critical acclaim. [[V. S. Pritchett]], reviewing the novel for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' stated: "I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Howe]],  ''Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four : Text, Sources, Criticism''. New York : Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982. {{ISBN|0-15-565811-5}} pp.&amp;nbsp;290–93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. H. Newby]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' magazine, described it as "the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since [[Rex Warner]]'s ''The Aerodrome.''"&lt;ref name="nf"&gt;"First Bites: ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.'' Nigel Fountain, ''The Guardian'', June 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was also praised by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Harold Nicolson]].&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Edward Shanks]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', was dismissive; Shanks claimed ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' "breaks all records for gloomy vaticination".&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was "odious rather than tragic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Clive Staples|title=''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature.''

The effect of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' on the English language is extensive; the concepts of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)#Response to Big Brother today|Big Brother]], [[Room 101]], the [[Thought Police]], [[thoughtcrime]], [[unperson]], [[memory hole]] (oblivion), [[doublethink]] (simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) and [[Newspeak]] (ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. [[Doublespeak]] and [[groupthink]] are both deliberate elaborations of ''doublethink'', and the adjective "Orwellian" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. The practice of ending words with {{nowrap|"-speak"}} (such as ''mediaspeak'') is drawn from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keyes |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Keyes (author) |title=I Love It When You Talk Retro |year=2009 |publisher=St Martins |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, [[11020 Orwell|an asteroid]] was discovered by [[Antonín Mrkos]] and named after Orwell.

==''Brave New World'' comparisons==
In the decades since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', there have been numerous comparisons to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/11859761/1984-Brave-New-World-Why-I-love-a-little-dystopia.html|title=1984?

However, members of the ruling class of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' use brutal force, torture and [[mind control]] to keep individuals in line, while rulers in ''Brave New World'' keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.

In October 1949, after reading ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', Huxley sent a letter to Orwell and wrote that it would be more efficient for rulers to stay in power by the softer touch by allowing citizens to self-seek pleasure to control them rather than brute force and to allow a false sense of freedom:

{{quote|
Within the next generation I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html Letter from Aldous Huxley to George Orwell]. Retrieved 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Elements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own ''Brave New World Revisited''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/ Aldous Huxley;s ''Brave New World Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/which-dystopian-novel-got-it-right-orwells-1984-or-huxleys-brave-new-world.html|title=Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell’s ‘1984’ or Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’?|date=2017-02-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/orwells-1984-and-trumps-america|title=Orwell’s “1984” and Trump’s America|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway" /&gt;

{{History of war}}
In the field of [[military theory]], the '''operational level of war''' (also called the '''operational art''', as derived from {{lang-ru|оперативное искусство}}, or the '''operational warfare''') represents the level of command that connects the details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the goals of [[strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Simpkin&lt;/ref&gt;

In Joint U.S. military [[Military doctrine|doctrine]], '''operational art''' is "the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs—supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces by integrating ends, ways, and means."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp5_0.pdf|title=Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 5-0, The Operations Process|last=Department of the Army|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=May 2012|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correlates political needs and military power. Operational art is defined by its military-political scope, not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Background==

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the synonymous term '''grand tactics''' (or, less frequently, ''maneuver tactics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Earl |title=Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness |date=2015 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=978-0-8071-5937-8 |page=xxi |edition=fourth }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was often used to describe the manoeuvres of troops not tactically [[engagement (military)|engaged]], while in the late 19th century to the [[First World War]] and through the Second World War, the term '''minor strategy''' was used by some military commentators.&lt;ref&gt;p.218, Jablonsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p.28, Whitman&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications, that sought to identify "...slightly different shades of meaning, such as tactics, major tactics, minor tactics, grand strategy, major strategy, and minor strategy".&lt;ref&gt;p.3, Bundel&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not widely used in the United States or Britain before 1980–1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hLBANX5rTIsC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in the Operational Level of War |isbn=9781134252251 |author1=Zabecki |first1=David T |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QTFLUTXixXEC |publisher=DIANE Publishing |page=v |title=The Operational Level of War |isbn=9781428915749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKGK_t8mYKAC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;pg=PA175 |page=175 |title=Strategy and History |isbn=9780887380655 |author1=Luttwak |first1=Edward |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it became much discussed and started to enter military doctrines and officer combat training courses.&lt;ref&gt;p. 111, Stone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===Mission analysis===
The operational-level strategist possesses numerous tools to frame and guide their thinking, but chief among these are mission analysis and end state. Mission analysis answers the question "What is to be accomplished?" Through mission analysis, the operational-level planner fuses political aims and military objectives. In so doing, the planner determines what application of military force will create military power to achieve the political purpose. Subordinate processes here include defining objectives and centers of gravity, but excessive dependence on analytical mechanisms can create false security. The final test rewards success, not the quality of the argument. Conversely, the planner cannot hope to "feel" a way to victory—complexity demands an integration of thought and effort.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===End state===
End state answers the question "What will constitute success?" The campaign end state is not merely a desired status quo of the military goal. It also establishes a touchstone for the tactical, operational and strategic levels. The end state manifests the intended results of military power and exposes any limitations. Indeed, an achievable end state may require the employment of nonmilitary elements of national power. As such, it recognizes that military power alone may not be capable of attaining political success.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Skills required==
An operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and likelihood. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and real-world practicum.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

== Role in historiography ==

While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of a specifically operational level of war are relatively new, in practice operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Peoples and commanders have long pursued political goals through military actions, and one can examine campaigns of any period from the [[existential]] perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus historians can analyze any war in terms of operational art.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

In the case of [[World War II]] analysis, the [[Wehrmacht]] did not use the operational level as a formal doctrinal concept during the campaigns of 1939–1945. While personnel within the German forces knew of operational art, awareness and practice was limited principally to [[German General Staff | general-staff]] trained officers. Nevertheless, the existential nature of operational art means that examining a campaign or an operation against political aims is valid irrespective of the doctrine or structures of the period. Thus the elements of operational art—time, space, means and purpose—can illuminate thoughts and actions of any era, regardless of the prevailing contemporary doctrine or structure.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

{{Islamic culture}}

An '''oriental rug''' is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in “[[Orient|Oriental countries]]” for home use, local sale, and export.

Oriental carpets can be [[knotted-pile carpet|pile]] woven or [[Kilim|flat woven]] without pile, using various materials such as silk, wool, and cotton. Examples range in size from pillow to large, room-sized carpets, and include carrier bags, floor coverings, decorations for animals, Islamic [[prayer rug]]s (''sajjadah''), Jewish Torah ark covers (''[[parochet]]''), and Christian altar covers. Since the [[High Middle Ages]], oriental rugs have been an integral part of their cultures of origin, as well as of the European and, later on, the North American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|pages=9–10|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, oriental rugs are made in an area referred to as the “Rug Belt”, which stretches from Morocco across North Africa, the Middle East, and into Central Asia and northern India. It includes countries such as northern [[China]], [[Tibet]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], the [[Maghreb]] in the west, the [[Caucasus]] in the north, and [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the south. People from different cultures, countries, racial groups and religious faiths are involved in the production of oriental rugs. Since many of these countries lie in an area which today is referred to as the [[Islamic world]], oriental rugs are often also called “'''Islamic Carpets'''”,&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term “oriental rug” is used mainly for convenience. The carpets from Iran are known as “'''[[Persian Carpets]]'''”.&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origin of the knotted pile rug ==
[[File:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|Border of the [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]], circa 400 BC.]]
The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory about the origin of the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of [[felt]], or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emery|first1=Irene|title=The primary structures of fabrics : an illustrated classification|date=2009|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0500288023|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces [[Soumak rug|soumak]], and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cootner|first1=Cathryn|editor1-last=Cootner|editor1-first=Cathryn|editor1-link=Flat woven textiles|title=Flat-weaves and knotted-pile: An historical and structural overview|date=1981|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A.|isbn=9780874050189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, hand-woven [[pile rug]]s are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wertime|first1=J|title=A new approach to the structural analysis of pile rugs.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=3|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical evidence from ancient sources ===
Probably the oldest existing texts referring to carpets are preserved in [[cuneiform]] writing on [[clay tablet]]s from the royal archives of the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], from the 2nd millennium BC. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for rug is ''mardatu'', and specialist rug weavers referred to as ''kāşiru'' are distinguished from other specialized professions like sack-makers (''sabsu'' or ''sabsinnu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Soden|first1=Wolfram|last2=Schley (transl.)|first2=Donald G.|title=The ancient Orient: an introduction to the study of the ancient Near East|date=1993|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=978-0802801425|page=107|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), I've requested a rug from my lord, and they did not give me (one). [...]" (letter 16 8)
&lt;br&gt;
"To my Lord speak! Your servant Ašqudum (says), About the woman who is staying by herself in the palace of Hişamta—The matter does not meet the eye. It would be good if 5 women who weave carpets&lt;ref&gt;lit.: "''mahrĩşa i-pe-şa''", "to do wool work", the interpretation proposed by [[Benno Landsberger]]&lt;/ref&gt; were staying with her."

&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Palace inventories from the archives of [[Nuzi]], from the 15th/14th century BC, record 20 large and 20 small ''mardatu'' to cover the chairs of [[Idrimi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer-Opificius|first1=Ruth|title=Rekonstruktion des Thrones des Fürsten Idrimi von Alalah = Reconstruction of the throne of Prince Idrimi of Alalah|journal=Ugarit Forschungen|date=1983|volume=15|pages=119–126|url=http://biblio.ebaf.edu/cgi-bin/koha/opac-ISBDdetail.pl?biblionumber=146759|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]] writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a “splendid carpet”. In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X “carpets” are mentioned.

Around 400 BC, the Greek author [[Xenophon]] mentions “carpets” in his book “[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]”:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς" [Xen. anab. VII.3.18]
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''|Xenophon, Anabasis, 400 BC&lt;ref&gt;https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%9A%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82/%CE%96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote in ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets (“polymita”) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the texts. Already the earliest known written sources refer to carpets as gifts given to, or required from, high-ranking persons.

=== Pazyryk: The first surviving pile rug ===

The oldest known hand knotted rug which is nearly completely preserved, and can, therefore, be fully evaluated in every technical and design aspect is the [[Pazyryk carpet]], dated to the 5th century BC. It was discovered in the late 1940s by the Russian archeologist Sergei Rudenko and his team.&lt;ref name="Frozen Tombs of Siberia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W.

Hermitagemuseum.org. Retrieved on 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The provenience of the Pazyryk carpet is under debate, as many carpet weaving countries claim to be its country of origin.&lt;ref name="The debate on the origin of carpets and rugs"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA357 The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art: The debate on the origin of rugs and carpets]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2015-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The carpet had been dyed with plant and insect dyes from the Mongolian steppes.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.212rugcleaners.com/blog/the-history-of-rugs/]&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever it was produced, its fine weaving in symmetric knots and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.

=== Fragments from Turkestan, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan ===
[[File:Textile fragment from Loulan Xinjiang China.jpg|thumb|Carpet fragment, [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], Xinjiang province, China, dated to 3rd-4th century AD. [[British Museum]], London]]
The explorer [[Mark Aurel Stein]] found flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD in [[Turpan]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet fragments dated to the third or fourth century BC were excavated from burial mounds at Bashadar in the [[Ongudai|Ongudai District]], [[Altai Republic]], [[Russia]] by S. Rudenko, the discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet. They show a fine weave of about 4650 asymmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] square decimeter&lt;ref name="Rudenko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W.  (transl.)|title=Frozen Tombs of Siberia|date=1970|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0460077156|pages=302–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfister|first1=R.|last2=Bellinger|first2=L.|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos; IV Vol. 2 The Textiles|date=1945|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the At-Tar caves in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="At-Tar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujii|first1=Hideo|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kazuko|editor1-last=Eiland|editor1-first=M.L.|title=The marked characteristics of carpets unearthed from the At-Tar caves, Iraq|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=35–40|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|pages=14–19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments are now in the [[House of Sabah|Al-Sabah]] Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamyya, [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="darmuseum.org.kw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Dar al-Athar al-Islamyya rugs and textiles collection|url=http://darmuseum.org.kw/the-collections/rugs-textiles/|website=http://darmuseum.org.kw/|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spuhler, Pre-Islamic carpets 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Pre-Islamic carpets and textiles from eastern lands.|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=Farnborough|isbn=9780500970546|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 13th–14th century: The Konya and Fostat fragments; findings from Tibetan monasteries ===

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the account of his [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travels]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming from Persia, Polo travelled from Sivas to Kayseri. [[Abu'l-Fida]], citing [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] refers to carpet export from Anatolian cities in the lte 13th century: “That's where Turkoman carpets are made, which are exported to all other countries”. He and the Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] mention Aksaray as a major rug weaving center in the early-to-mid-14th century.

Pile woven Turkish carpets were found in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] Period (1243–1302). Eight fragments were found in 1905 by F.R. Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R. State and Court Print|location=Vienna|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in Konya, four in the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]] in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925.&lt;ref name="Beyshehir fragments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riefstahl|first1=Rudolf Meyer|title=Primitive Rugs of the "Konya" type in the Mosque of Beyshehir|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1931|volume=13|issue=4|pages=177–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; More fragments were found in [[Fustat|Fostat]], today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By their original size (Riefstahl reports a carpet up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} long), the Konya carpets must have been produced in town manufactories, as looms of this size cannot be set up in a nomadic or village home. Where exactly these carpets were woven is unknown. The field patterns of the Konya carpets are mostly geometric, and small in relation to the carpet size. Similar patterns are arranged in diagonal rows: Hexagons with plain, or hooked outlines; squares filled with stars, with interposed kufic-like ornaments; hexagons in diamonds composed of rhomboids, rhomboids filed with stylized flowers and leaves. Their main borders often contain kufic ornaments. The corners are not “resolved”, which means that the border design is cut off, and does not continue around the corners. The colours (blue, red, green, to a lesser extent also white, brown, yellow) are subdued, frequently two shades of the same colour are opposed to each other. Nearly all carpet fragments show different patterns and ornaments.

The Beyşehir carpets are closely related to the Konya carpets in design and colour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the "animal carpets" of the following period, depictings of animals are rarely seen in the Seljuq carpet fragments. Rows of horned quadrupeds placed opposite to each other, or birds beside a tree can be recognized on some fragments. A near-complete carpet of this kind is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]]. It has survived in a Tibetan monastery and was removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]].

The style of the Seljuq carpets finds parallels amongst the architectural decoration of contemporaneous mosques such as those at [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği]], [[Sivas]], and [[Erzurum]], and may be related to Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich = The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are today at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya, and at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in Istanbul.

=== Current understanding of the origin of pile-woven carpets ===
Knotted pile woven carpets were likely produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debated whether pile-knotted carpets were initially woven by nomads who tried to imitate animal pelts as tent-floor coverings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were a product of settled peoples. A number of knives was found in the graves of women of a settled community in southwest [[Turkestan]]. The knives are remarkably similar to those used by Turkmen weavers for trimming the pile of a carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=Jungbronzezeitliche Gräberfelder im Sumbar-Tal, Südwest-Turkmenistan = Early Bronze age cemeteries in the Sumbar valley, East Turkestan|date=1986|publisher=Beck|location=München|isbn=978-3406315398|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/29303067?q&amp;versionId=35641318|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=The manufacture of pile carpets in Bronze Age Central Asia.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient motifs on Turkmen carpets closely resemble the ornaments seen on early pottery from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|title=Decorative designs on prehistoric Turkmenian ceramics.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings suggest that Turkestan may be among the first places we know of where pile-woven carpets were produced, but this does not mean it was the only place.

In the light of ancient sources and archaeological discoveries, it seems highly likely that the pile-woven carpet developed from one of the extra-weft wrapping weaving techniques, and was first woven by settled people. The technique has probably evolved separately at different places and times. During the migrations of nomadic groups from Central Asia, the technique and designs may have spread throughout the area which was to become the “rug belt” in later times. With the emergence of Islam, the westward migration of nomadic groups began to change Near Eastern history. After this period, knotted-pile carpets became an important form of art under the influence of Islam, and where the nomadic tribes spread, and began to be known as “Oriental” or “Islamic” carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U.

An oriental rug is woven by hand on a loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made mainly of natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In representative carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.

=== Materials ===

Materials used in carpet weaving and the way they are combined vary in different rug weaving areas. Mainly, animal [[wool]] from sheep and goats is used, occasionally also from camels. Yak and horse hair have been used in Far Eastern, but rarely in Middle Eastern rugs. [[Cotton]] is used for the foundation of the rug, but also in the pile. [[Silk]] from [[Bombyx mori|silk worms]] is used for representational rugs.

==== Wool ====

In most oriental rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=32|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, rug wools come mainly from the [[Fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed]] and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of [[Baluch rug|Baluchi]] and [[Turkmen rug]]s, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|page=25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cotton ====

[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Silk ====

[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets of the Mamluk, Ottoman, and Safavid courts. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design in [[Turkmen rug]]s, but more expensive carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan in Persia, and Istanbul and Hereke in Turkey, have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillow tapestry. Silk is more often used in rugs of Eastern Turkestan and Northwestern China, but these rugs tend to be more coarsely woven.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}

[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. With the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all the rugs produced in the countries of the rug belt use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===

[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5 |Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Vegetal dyes ====

[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used for oriental rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented in oriental rugs since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s, and later on, in Iran.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyzes, natural dyes used in Turkish carpets include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. In some instances, the analysis of the dye has provided information about the provenience of a rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enez|first1=N.|editor1-last=Eiland jr.|editor1-first=M.L.|title=Dye research on the prayer rugs of the Topkapi Collection|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=191–204|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur (perhaps identical with the ''isparek'' plant), or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=54|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insect reds ====

[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=33–34|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====

With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====

The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a pre-planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tools ===
{{see also|Weaving}}
A variety of tools are needed for the construction of a handmade rug. A [[loom]], a horizontal or upright framework, is needed to mount the vertical [[Warp (weaving)|warps]] into which the pile nodes are knotted. One or more shoots of horizontal [[Warp and woof|wefts]] are woven (“shot”) in after each row of knots in order to further stabilize the fabric.

==== Horizontal looms ====

Nomads usually use a horizontal loom. In its simplest form, two loom beams are fastened, and kept apart by stakes which are driven into the ground. The tension of the warps is maintained by driving wedges between the loom beams and the stakes. If the nomad journey goes on, the stakes are pulled out, and the unfinished rug is rolled up on the beams. The size of the loom beams is limited by the need to be easily transportable, thus, genuine nomad rugs are often small in size. In Persia, loom beams were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=22–28|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer the warps are spanned, the more dense the rug can be woven. The width of a rug is always determined by the length of the loom beams. Weaving starts at the lower end of the loom, and proceeds towards the upper end.

Traditionally, horizontal looms were used by the
* [[Kurds]], [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Lurs]], [[Beluch]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] in Persia,
* [[Beluch]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] in Afghanistan and Turkmenistan
* Kurds and nomads ([[Yörük]]) in Anatolia.

==== Vertical looms ====

The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams. While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical loom longer carpets can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved to the back of the loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released, the finished section of the carpet is pulled around the lower beam and upwards on the back of the loom. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, it is wound up on the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.
The vertical loom enables weaving of larger rug formats. The most simple vertical loom, usually used in villages, has fixed beams. The length of the loom determines the length of the rug. As the weaving proceeds, the weavers' benches must be moved upwards, and fixed again at the new working height. Another type of loom is used in manufactures. The wefts are fixed and spanned on the beams, or, in more advanced types of looms, the wefts are spanned on a roller beam, which allows for any length of carpet to be woven, as the finished part of the carpet is rolled up on the roller beam. Thus, the weavers' benches always remain at the same height.

==== Other tools ====

Few essential tools are needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, and a pair of scissors for trimming off the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects from the end of the blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=24–25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Warp, weft, pile ===

[[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] and [[Warp and woof|wefts]] form the foundation of the carpet, the pile accounts for the design. Warps, wefts and pile may consist of any of these materials:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! warp
! weft
! pile
! often found in
|-
|wool ||wool ||wool ||nomad and village rugs
|-
|cotton ||cotton ||wool ||manufacture rugs
|-
|silk ||silk ||silk ||manufacture rugs
|-
|cotton ||cotton ||silk ||manufacture rugs
|}

Rugs can be woven with their warp strings held back on different levels, termed sheds. This is done by pulling the wefts of one shed tight, separating the warps on two different levels, which leaves one warp on a lower level. The technical term is “one warp is depressed”. Warps can be depressed slightly, ore more tightly, which will cause a more or less pronounced rippling or “ridging” on the back of the rug. A rug woven with depressed warps is described as “double warped”. Central Iranian city rugs such as Kashan, Isfahan, Qom, and Nain have deeply depressed warps, which make the pile more dense, the rug is heavier than a more loosely woven specimen, and the rug lies more firmly on the floor. Kurdish [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar carpets]] make most pronounced use of warp depression. Often their pile is further compacted by the use of a metal rod which is driven between the warps and hammered down on, which produces a dense and rigid fabric.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knots ===

}}

The pile knots are usually knotted by hand. Most rugs from Anatolia utilize the symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish double knot]]. With this form of knotting, each end of the pile thread is twisted around two warp threads at regular intervals, so that both ends of the knot come up between two warp strings on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The thread is then pulled downwards and cut with a knife.

Most rugs from other provenances use the asymmetric, or [[Persian knot]]. This knot is tied by winding a piece of thread around one warp, and halfway around the next warp, so that both ends of the thread come up at the same side of two adjacent strings of warp on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The pile, i.e., the loose end of the thread, can appear on the left or right side of the warps, thus defining the terms “open to the left” or “open to the right”. Variances in the type of knots are significant, as the type of knot used in a carpet may vary on a regional, or tribal, basis. Whether the knots are open to the left or to the right can be determined by passing one's hands over the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-85669-132-2|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant knot is the so-called jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps. Jufti can be knotted symmetrically or asymmetrically, open to the left or right.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"/&gt;  A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn than traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=366–7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of knot is known from early Spanish rugs. The Spanish knot or single-warp knot, is tied around one single warp. Some of the rug fragments excavated by A. Stein in Turfan seem to be woven with a single knot. Single knot weavings are also known from [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts|Coptic]] pile rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=37–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular knots sometimes occur, and include missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, both symmetric and asymmetric. They are frequently found in Turkmen rugs, and contribute to the dense and regular structure of these rugs.

Diagonal, or offset knotting has knots in successive rows occupy alternate pairs of warps. This feature allows for changes from one half knot to the next, and creates diagonal pattern lines at different angles. It is sometimes found in Kurdish or Turkmen rugs, particularly in Yomuds. It is mostly tied symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The upright pile of oriental rugs usually inclines in one direction, as knots are always pulled downwards before the string of pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling row after row of knots on top of each other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. [[Prayer rug]]s are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends in the direction of the worshipper's prostration).

==== Knot count ====
{{Main|Knot count}}
[[File:Knoopdichtheid ghom.jpg|thumb|Back side of a [[Qom rug]] with very high knot density]]
The knot count is expressed in knots per square inch (''kpsi'') or per square decimeter. Knot count per square decimeter can be converted to square inch by division by 15.5. Knot counts are best performed on the back of the rug. If the warps are not too deeply depressed, the two loops of one knot will remain visible, and will have to be counted as one knot. If one warp is deeply depressed, only one loop of the knot may be visible, which has to be considered when the knots are counted.

Compared to the kpsi counts, additional structural information is obtained when the horizontal and vertical knots are counted separately. In Turkmen carpets, the ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Considerable technical skill is required to achieve this knot ratio. Rugs which are woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Knot counts bear evidence of the fineness of the weaving, and of the amount of labour needed to complete the rug. However, the artistic and utilitarian value of a rug hardly depends on knot counts, but rather on the execution of the design and the colours. For example, Persian Heriz or some Anatolian carpets may have low knot counts as compared to the extremely fine-woven Qom or Nain rugs, but provide artistic designs, and are resistant to wear.

=== Finishing ===
Once the weaving is finished, the rug is cut from the loom. Additional work has to be done before the rug is ready for use.

==== Edges and ends ====

The edges of a rug need additional protection, as they are exposed to particular mechanical stress. The last warps on each side of the rug are often thicker than the inner warps, or doubled. The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by weft shoots looping over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called selvedges, or ''shirazeh'' from the Persian word.

The remaining ends of the warp threads form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in some other manner.  Especially Anatolian village and nomadic rugs have flat-woven [[kilim]] ends, made by shooting in wefts without pile at the beginning and end of the weaving process. They provide further protection against wear, and sometimes include pile-woven tribal signs or village crests.

==== Pile ====

The pile of the carpet is shorn with special knives (or carefully burned down) in order to remove excess pile and obtain an equal surface. In parts of Central Asia, a small sickle-shaped knife with the outside edge sharpened is used for pile shearing. Knives of this shape have been excavated from [[Bronze Age]] sites in Turkmenistan (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=31|isbn=978-0821225486|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In some carpets, a relief effect is obtained by clipping the pile unevenly following the contours of the design. This feature is often seen in [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs.

==== Washing ====

Most carpets are washed before they are used or go to the market. The washing may be done with water and soap only, but more often chemicals are added to modify the colours. Various chemical washings were invented in New York, London, and other European centers. The washing often included chlorine bleach or sodium hydrosulfite. Chemical washings not only damage the wool fibers, but change the colours to an extent that some rugs had to be re-painted with different colours after the washing, as is exemplified by the so-called "American Sarouk" carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

== Design ==

Oriental rugs are known for their richly varied designs, but common traditional characteristics identify the design of a carpet as “oriental”.  With the exception of pile relief obtained by clipping the pile unevenly, rug design originates from a two-dimensional arrangement of knots in various colours. Each knot tied into a rug can be regarded as one "[[pixel]]" of a picture, which is composed by the arrangement of knot after knot. The more skilled the weaver or, as in manufactured rugs, the designer, the more elaborate the design.

=== Rectilinear and curvilinear design ===

{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = ''Left image'': Silk Tabriz Persian rug with a predominantly curvilinear design&lt;br&gt; ''Right image'': Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| footer_align = left | image1 =|Silk Tabriz Persian Rug 7991 with a predominantly curvilinear design| width1 = 185 | caption1  = | image2 =Antique Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, 9ft 11in x 12ft 10in, circa 1875,.jpg|Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| width2 = 200 | caption2 = }}

A rug design is described either as '''rectilinear''' (or “geometric”), or '''curvilinear''' (or “floral”). Curvilinear rugs show floral figures in a realistic manner. The drawing is more fluid, and the weaving is often more complicated. Rectilinear patterns tend to be bolder and more angular. Floral patterns can be woven in rectilinear design, but they tend to be more abstract, or more highly stylized. Rectilinear design is associated with nomadic or village weaving, whereas the intricate curvilinear designs require pre-planning, as is done in factories. Workshop rugs are usually woven according to a plan designed by an artist and handed over to the weaver to execute it on the loom.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|page=170|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This feature is typical for [[Turkish carpet|rugs made in Anatolia]].]]

Rug design can also be described by how the surface of the rug is arranged and organized. One single, basic design may cover the entire field (“all-over design”). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Islamic rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments in a manner called "infinite repeat".&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common “Lechek Torūnj” (medallion and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In Persian rugs, the medallion represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinated, creating an impression of the medallion “floating” on the field. Anatolian rugs often use the infinite repeat as the primary pattern, and integrate the medallion as secondary. Its size is often adapted to fit into the infinite repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Oriental rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines or reciprocal trefoils. The latter are frequently found in Caucasian and some Turkish rugs, and are related to the Chinese “cloud collar” (yun chien) motif.&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. Seen in Kerman rugs and Turkish rugs from the late eighteenth century "mecidi" period, this feature was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs. Additional end borders called ''elem'', or skirts, are seen in Turkmen and some Turkish rugs. Their design often differs from the rest of the borders. Elem are used to protect the lower borders of tent door rugs ("ensi"). [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs sometimes do not have any borders.

Designing the carpet borders becomes particularly challenging when it comes to the corner articulations. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be “resolved”. In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver has discontinued the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolutions helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===

The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the ''[[Paisley (design)|boteh]]'' is used throughout the “carpet belt”. Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=36–51|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=51–168|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called “fish”.  Herati patterns are used throughout the “carpet belt”; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Sefavi period, and the “claws” of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.
* The '''[[Gül|Gul]]''' design is frequently found in [[Turkmen rug]]s. Small round or octagonal medallions are repeated in rows all over the field. Although the Gül medallion itself can be very elaborate and colourful, their arrangement within the monochrome field often generates a stern and somber impression. Güls are often ascribed a heraldic function, as it is possible to identify the tribal provenience of a Turkmen rug by its güls.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Turkmen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ian|title=Turkmen.

=== Special designs ===
A different type of field design in a specific Islamic design tradition is used in [[prayer rug]]s. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]], an architectural element in [[mosque]]s intended to direct the worshippers towards the [[Qibla]].  Prayer rugs also show highly symbolic smaller design elements like one or more [[mosque lamp]]s, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]], or water jugs, potentially as a reminder towards ritual cleanliness. Sometimes stylized hands or feet appear in the field to indicate where the worshipper should stand, or to represent the praying person's prostration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=127–143|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other special types include garden, compartment, vase, animal, or pictorial designs

=== The 15th century "design revolution" ===

During the 15th century, a fundamental change appeared in carpet design. Because no carpets survived from this period, research has focused on [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. Earlier Timurid paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with “kufic” border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially the “[[Holbein carpet]]s” that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier “kufic” border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. The resulting change in carpet design was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''“carpet design revolution”'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=30–32|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intra- and intercultural contexts ==
[[File:TownVillageNomads.jpg|thumb|Cultural interactions in traditional carpet production]]

Four "social layers" of carpet production can be distinguished: Rugs were woven simultaneously by and for nomads, rural villages, towns, and the royal court. Rural village, and nomad carpet designs represent independent artistic traditions.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Elaborate rug designs from court and town were integrated into village and nomadic design traditions by means of a process termed stylization.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; When rugs are woven for the market, the weavers adapt their production in order to meet the customers' demands, and to maximize their profit. As is the case with Oriental rugs, adaptation to the export market has brought forth both devastating effects on the culture of rug weaving, but has also led to a revival of old traditions in more recent years.

=== Representative ("court") carpets ===
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature by Mir Sayyid Ali, circa 1540. [[British Museum]], London]]

Representative "court" rugs were woven by special workshops, often founded and supervised by the sovereign, with the intention to represent power and status:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=273–275|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman (Byzantine)]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] Empires have coexisted for more than 400 years. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabularies, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Anatolian carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|“Paele Madonna”]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs were produced in the court manufactures as special commissions or gifts (some carpets included inwoven European coats of arms). Their elaborate design required a division of work between an artist who created a design plan (termed “cartoon”) on paper, and a weaver who was given the plan for execution on the loom. Thus, artist and weaver were separated.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"/&gt; Their appearance in Persian book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniatures]] as well as in European paintings provides material for their dating by using the [[Terminus post quem|''“terminus ante quem”'']] approach.

=== Town, village, nomadic rugs ===

High-status examples like Safavid or Ottoman court carpets are not the only foundation of the historical and social framework. The reality of carpet production does not reflect this selection: Carpets were simultaneously produced by and for the three different social levels. Patterns and ornaments from court manufactory rugs have been reproduced by smaller (town or village) workshops. This process is well documented for Ottoman prayer rugs.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; As prototypical court designs were passed on to smaller workshops, and from one generation to the next, the design underwent a process termed stylization, comprising series of small, incremental changes either in the overall design, or in details of smaller patterns and ornaments, over time. As a result, the prototype may be modified to an extent as to barely being recognizable. A mihrab column may change into a detached row of ornaments, a Chinese dragon may undergo stylization until it becomes unrecognizable in a Caucasian dragon carpet.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Stylization in Turkish prayer rug design ====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Pile rugs and flat weaves were essential items in all rural households and nomadic tents. They were part of a tradition that was at times influenced, but essentially distinct from the invented designs of the workshop production. Frequently, mosques had acquired rural carpets as [[Waqf|charitable gifts]], which provided material for studies.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, Vakiflar Museum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpinar|first1=Belkis|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel, Germany|isbn=9783923185047|edition=German/English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural carpets rarely include cotton for warps and wefts, and almost never silk, as these materials had to be purchased on the market.

With the end of the traditional [[Transhumance|nomadic lifestyle]] in large parts of the rug belt area, and the consequent loss of specific traditions, it has become difficult to identify a genuine “nomadic rug”. Tribes known for their nomadic lifestyle like the [[Yürük]] in Anatolia, or the [[Kurds]] and [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] in contemporary Turkey and Southwestern Iran have voluntarily or by force acquired sedentary lifestyles. Migration of peoples and tribes, in peace or warfare, has frequently happened throughout the history of [[Turkic peoples]], as well as Persian and Caucasian tribes. Some designs may have been preserved, which can be identified as specifically nomadic or tribal.&lt;ref name="Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Housego|first1=Jenny|title=Tribal Rugs|date=1998|publisher=Olive Branch Press|location=London|isbn=9781566562188|edition=1998 reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Black Oriental Carpets"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=David|last2=Loveless|first2=Clive|title=Woven Gardens: Nomad and Village Rugs of the Fars Province of Southern Persia|date=1979|publisher=David Black Oriental Carpets|location=London|isbn=9780950501833|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mackie|editor1-first=Louise|editor2-last=Thompson|editor2-first=Jon|title=Turkmen: Tribal Carpets and Traditions|date=1980|publisher=The Textile Museum|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=9780295965956|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Nomadic” rugs can be identified by their material, construction, and colours.

Criteria for nomadic production include:&lt;ref name="Brueggemann/Boehmer, 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann, W., and Boehmer, H.|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unusual materials like warps made of goat's hair, or camel wool in the pile;
* high quality wool with long pile (Anatolian and Turkmen nomads);
* small format fitting for a horizontal loom;
* irregular format due to frequent re-assembly of the loom, resulting in irregular tension of the warps;
* pronounced abrash (irregularities within the same colour due to dyeing of yarn in small batches);
* inclusion of flat weaves at the ends.

Within the genre of carpet weaving, the most authentic village and nomadic products were those woven to serve the needs of the community, which were not intended for export or trade other than local. This includes specialized bags and bolster covers (''yastik'') in Anatolia, which show designs adapted from the earliest weaving traditions.&lt;ref name="Steiner, Heybe ve Torba"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Pinkwart|first2=Doris|last3=Ammermann|first3=Eberhart|title=Bergama Heybe ve Torba: Traditional bags of the Yürüks in Northwest Anatolia, Observations from 1970 to 2007 / Traditionelle Taschen der Yürüken Nordwest-Anatoliens.

Smaller (''torba'') and midsize (''mafrash'') and a variety of special bags to keep bread or salt were woven. They are usually made of two sides, one or both of them pile or flat-woven, and then sewn together. Long tent bands woven in mixed pile and flat weave adorned the tents, and carpets known as ''ensi'' covered the entrance of the tent, while the door was decorated with a pile-woven door surround. Turkmen, and also tribes like the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] nomads of western Iran, or the [[Qashqai people]] wove animal trappings like saddle covers, or special decorations for weddings like ''asmalyk'', pentagonally shaped camel coverings used for wedding decorations. Tribal signs like the Turkmen [[Gül]] can support the assessment of provenience.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

{{Quotation|The symbolism of Oriental rug designs has recently been made the subject of a number of articles. Many of the ideas put forward are of great interest, but to attempt to discuss such a subject without a profound knowledge of the philosophies of the East would be unwise, and could easily provide unreliable food for unbridled imaginations. One may believe implicitly in certain things, but especially if they have an ancient religious basis, it may not always be possible to prove them. Such ideas merit attention.|May H. Beattie, ''Carpets of central Persia'', 1976, p. 19}}

Oriental rugs from various proveniences often share common motifs. Various attempts have been made to determine the potential origin of these ornaments. Woven motifs of folk art undergo changes through processes depending on human creativity, trial and error, and unpredictable mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vavilov's theory of origins|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also through the more active process of stylization. The latter process is well documented, as the integration into the work of rural village and nomad weavers of patterns designed in town manufactures can be followed on carpets which still exist. In the more archaic motifs, the process of pattern migration and evolution cannot be documented, because the material evidence does not exist any more. This has led to various speculations about the origins and “meanings” of patterns, often resulting in unsubstantiated claims.

==== Prehistoric symbolism ====

In 1967, the British archaeologist James Mellaart claimed to have found the oldest records of flat woven [[kilim]]s on wall paintings he discovered in the [[Çatalhöyük]] excavations, dated to circa 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=R. H.|title=Catal Huyuk. A Neolithic Town in Anatolia. James Mellaart. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967. 232 pp., illus. $9.95|journal=Science|date=22 September 1967|volume=157|issue=3795|pages=1419–1420|doi=10.1126/science.157.3795.1419}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drawings Mellaart claimed to have made before the wall paintings disappeared after their exposure showed clear similarities to nineteenth century designs of Turkish flatweaves. He interpreted the forms, which evoked a female figure, as evidence of a Mother Goddess cult in Çatalhöyük. A well-known pattern in Anatolian kilims, sometimes referred to as ''[[Elibelinde]]'' (lit.: “hands on hips”), was therefore determined to depict the Mother Goddess herself. This theory had to be abandoned after Mellaarts claims were denounced as fraudulent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlamallett.com/ch.htm Oriental Rug Review, August/September 1990 (Vol. 10, No. 6)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his claims refuted by other archaeologists. The elibelinde motif lost its divine meaning and prehistoric origin. It is today understood as a design of stylized carnation flowers, and its development can be traced back in a detailed and unbroken line to Ottoman court carpets of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

''Variations of the [[Elibelinde]] motif''

==== Apotropaic symbols ====

[[File:Amulet Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|[[Amulet]] (Muska) [[kilim motifs|kilim motif]], for protection (3 examples)]]

Symbols of protection against evil are frequently found on Ottoman and later Anatolian carpets. The Turkish name for these symbols is ''nazarlık'' (lit.: "[protection from] the evil eye"). [[Apotropaic magic|Apotropaic]] symbols include the [[Cintamani]] motif, often depicted on white ground [[Ushak carpet|Selendi]] carpets, which consists of three balls and a pair of wavy stripes. It serves the same purpose as protective inscriptions like "May God protect", which are seen woven into rugs. Another protective [[Kilim motifs|symbol often woven into carpets]] is the triangular talisman pendant, or "''muska''". This symbol is found in Anatolian, Persian, Caucasian and Central Asian carpets.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Tribal symbols ====
Some carpets include symbols which serve as a tribal crest and sometimes allow for the identification of the weaver's tribe. This is especially true for Turkmen pile woven textiles, which depict a variety of different medallion-like polygonal patterns called [[Gul (design)|Gul]], arranged in rows all over the field. While the origin of the pattern can be traced back to Buddhist depictions of the lotus blossom,&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"/&gt; it remains questionable if the weaver of such a tribal symbol was aware of its origins.

==== "Kufic" borders ====

Early Anatolian carpets often show a geometric border design with two arrowhead-like extensions in a sequence of tall-short-tall. By its similarity to the [[kufic]] letters of alif and lām, borders with this ornament are called "kufic" borders. The letters are thought to represent the word “[[Allah]]”. Another theory relates the tall-short-tall ornament to split-palmette motifs. The "alif-lām" motif is already seen on early Anatolian carpets from the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]].&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

==== Symbolism of the prayer rug ====
[[File:Shirvan 01.jpg|thumb|Shirvan Prayer rug with a rectangular niche, depicting inwoven hands and an ornament representing the mosque lamp]]

The symbolism of the Islamic [[Prayer rug]] is more easily understandable. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]] in every mosque, a directional point to direct the [[worship]]per towards [[Mecca]]. Often one or more [[mosque lamp]]s hang from the point of the arch, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]]. Sometimes a comb and pitcher are depicted, which is a reminder for Muslims to wash their hands and for men to comb their hair before performing prayer. Stylized hands are woven in the rug pile, indicating where the hands should be placed when performing prayer, often also interpreted as the [[Hamsa]], or “Hand of Fatima”, a protective amulet against the [[evil eye]].

=== Cultural effects of commercialization ===

Since the beginning of the Oriental rug trade in the High Middle Ages, Western market demand has influenced the rug manufacturers producing for export, who had to adapt their production in order to accommodate Western market demands. The commercial success of oriental rugs, and the [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]] thinking which arose during the sixteenth century, led European sovereigns to initiate and promote carpet manufactories in their European home countries. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Western companies set up weaving facilities in the rug-producing countries, and commissioned designs specifically invented according to Western taste.

Rugs exist which are known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the technique and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Sweden]], flat and pile woven rugs (called “''[[Rya (rug)|rya]]''”, or “''rollakan''”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster carpets]] were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the [[Savonnerie manufactory]] began weaving pile carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “''mecidi''”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company [[Ziegler &amp; Co.]] maintained workshops in [[Tabriz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Sultanabad]] (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as [[Liberty &amp; Company]] and [[Harvey Nichols]]. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansel|first1=Antony Wynn ; with a foreword by Philip|title=Three camels to Smyrna: times of war and peace in Turkey, Persia, India, Afghanistan &amp; Nepal, 1907-1986 : the story of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Company|date=2008|publisher=Hali|location=London|isbn=9781898113676}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A.

In the late nineteenth century, the Western invention of synthetic [[dye]]s had a devastating effect on the traditional way of carpet production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bode|first1=Wilhelm von|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche aus alter Zeit|date=1902|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|page=158 ff|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neugebauer, R |author2=Orendi, J|title=Handbuch der Orientalischen Teppichkunde|date=1920|publisher=Karl W.

The traditional design of the Saruk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=141–142|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its home countries, the ancient art and craft of carpet weaving has been revived. Since the early 1980s, initiatives were ongoing like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative|DOBAG project]] in Turkey, in Iran,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and by various social projects in Afghanistan and amongst Tibetan refugees in Northern India. Naturally dyed, traditionally woven rugs are available on the Western market again.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique carpets sold at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

=== Forgery ===
Oriental rugs have always attracted collectors' interest, and sold at high prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/persian-rug-carpet-sells-world-record-price-475630 |title=Persian Rug Sells For World Record $33.7m |publisher=International Business Times |first=Hannah |last=Osborne |work=ibtimes.co.uk |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been an incentive for fraudulent behaviour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Techniques used traditionally in rug restoration, like replacing knots, or re-weaving parts of a rug, can also be used to modify a rug so as to appear older or more valuable than it actually is. Old flatweaves can be unravelled to obtain longer threads of yarn which can then be re-knitted into rugs. These forgeries are able to overcome [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] dye analysis and [[radiocarbon dating]], since they make use of period material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hebborn|first1=Eric|title=The Art Forger's Handbook|date=1997|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0304349143|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romanian artisan Teodor Tuduc has become famous for his fake oriental rugs, and the stories which he delivered in order to gain credibility. The quality of his forgeries was such that some of his rugs found their way into museum collections, and “Tuduc rugs” have themselves become collectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Handbook of Fakes by Tuduc (world's most famous rug forger), published on the occasion of the Volkmann-Treffen Symposium, Berlin, October, 2012|date=2012|publisher=Stefano Ionescu|location=Rome|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugs by regions ==
Oriental rugs can be classified by their region of origin, each of which represents different strands of tradition: [[Persian rug]]s, [[Pakistani rug]]s, [[Arabian carpet|Arabian rug]]s, [[Turkish carpet|Anatolian rug]]s, [[Kurdish rug]]s, [[Caucasian carpets and rugs|Caucasian rugs]], Central Asian rugs, [[Turkish rug|Turkestanian (Turkmen, Turkoman) rugs]], [[Chinese rug]]s, [[Tibetan rug]]s and Indian rugs.

=== Persian (Iranian) rugs ===

{{main article|Persian carpet}}
The Persian carpet or Persian rug is an essential and distinguished part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Persian art|art]], and dates back to [[Persian Empire|ancient Persia]].
Persian carpets are classified by the social setting in which they were woven (nomads, villages, town and court manufactories), by ethnic groups (e.g. [[Kurds]], nomadic tribes such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] or [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]]; [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmens]]) and others, or by the town or province where carpets are woven, such as [[Heriz]], [[Hamadan]], [[Senneh]], [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] (Sultanabad), [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Kashan]], [[Qom]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]], and others. A technical classification for Persian carpets is based on material used for warps, wefts, and pile, spinning and plying of the yarn, dyeing, weaving technique, and aspects of finishing including the ways how the sides (selvedges) and ends are reinforced against wear.

=== Anatolian (Turkish) rugs ===
{{main article|Turkish carpet}}
Turkish carpets are produced mainly in [[Anatolia]], including neighbouring areas. Carpet weaving is a traditional art in Anatolia, dating back to pre-Islamic times, and integrates different cultural traditions reflecting the history of [[Turkic peoples]]. Turkish carpets form an essential part of the Turkish culture.

Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is distinguished by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]], or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets date from the thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, as well as in villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets ([[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.
Following a decline which began in the second half of the nineteenth century, initiatives like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative]] in 1982, or the [[Turkish Cultural Foundation]] in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.&lt;ref name="TCF Natural Dyes Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Cultural Foundation|url=http://www.tcfdatu.org/en/home/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish carpet is distinct from carpets of other provenience in that it makes more pronounced use of primary colours. Western Anatolian carpets prefer red and blue colours, whereas Central Anatolian use more red and yellow, with sharp contrasts set in white. With the exceptions of representative court and town manufacture designs, Turkish carpets make more pronounced use of bold geometric, and highly stylized floral patterns, generally in rectilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMullan|first1=Joseph V.|title=Islamic Carpets|date=1965|publisher=Near Eastern Art Research Center|location=New York|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian Mamluk rugs ===
[[File:The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet.jpg|thumb|The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet]]

Under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], a distinctive carpet was produced in Egypt. Called "Damascene" carpets by previous centuries, there is no doubt now that the center of production was [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

European and Islamic Sources from the 15.-18. Century|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to nearly all other oriental rugs, Mamluk carpets used “S” (clockwise) spun and “Z” (anti-clockwise)-plied wool. Their palette of colours and shades is limited to bright red, pale blue, and light green, blue and yellow are rarely found. The field design is characterized by polygonal medallions and stars and stylized floral patterns, arranged in a linear way along their central axis, or centralized. The borders contain rosettes, often alternating with cartouches. As [[Edmund de Unger]] pointed out, the design is similar to other products of Mamluk manufacture, like wood- and metal work, and book bindings, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] and floor mosaics.&lt;ref name="de Unger, Mamluk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Unger|first1=Edmund|title=The Origin of the Mamluk Carpet Design|journal=Hali|date=1980|volume=2|issue=4|pages=321–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamluk carpets were made for the court, and for export, Venice being the most important market place for Mamluk rugs in Europe.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

After the 1517 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. The Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt, and probably also in Anatolia, into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caucasian rugs ===
{{main article|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}
{{See also|Armenian carpet|Azerbaijani rug}}
[[File:Azeri carpet-maker.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani woman makes a carpet. Early 20th century]]
The Caucasian provinces of [[Karabagh]], Moghan, [[Shirvan]], [[Daghestan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] formed the northern territories of the [[Safavid Empire]]. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], 1813, the provinces were finally ceded to Russia. Russian rule was further extended to [[Baku]], [[Genje]], the [[Derbent]] khanate, and the region of [[Talish]]. In the 19th century the main weaving zone of the Caucasus was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, in a region which today comprises [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1990, Richard E. Wright claimed that ethnicities other than the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri population]] "also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Carpets xv. Caucasian Carpets – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian population surveys from 1886 and 1897&lt;ref&gt;cited in Eiland &amp; Eiland, 1998, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the ethnic distribution of the population is extremely complex in the southern Caucasus. With regard to antique carpets and rugs, the weavers' identity or ethnicity remains unknown. Eiland &amp; Eiland stated in 1998 that "it should not be taken for granted that the majority population in a particular area was also responsible for the weaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eiland|first2=Murray|title=Oriental rugs : a complete guide|date=2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|isbn=9781856691321|page=263|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a variety of theories about the ethnic origin of carpet patterns, and a variety of classifications have been put forward, sometimes attributing one and the same carpet to different ethnic groups. The debate is still ongoing, and remains unresolved.

In 1728 the Polish Jesuit Thaddaeus Krusinski wrote that at the beginning of the seventeenth century Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] had established carpet manufactories in Shirvan and Karabagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tadeusz Jan Krusiński |first1=T.

Characteristic motifs include stylized Chinese dragons in the so-called '''“Dragon carpets”''', combat scenes of tigers and stags, or floral motifs. The style is highly abstract to an extent that the animal forms become unrecognizable, unless compared to earlier Safavid animals and 16th century "vase style" carpets depicting the same motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Bode |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Kühnel |first2=Ernst |title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra.

Among the most popular groups of Caucasian rugs are the '''“Star Kazak”'''&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=D. |last2=Franses |first2=M. |last3=Pinner |first3=R. |title=Caucasian Carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum |journal=Hali |date=1980 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirchheim |first1=H. |title=Orient Stars.

A precise classification of Caucasian rugs is particularly difficult, even compared to other types of oriental rugs. Virtually no information is available from before the end of the nineteenth century, when Caucasian rugs began to be exported in larger numbers. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] socialistic economy, carpet production was organized in industrial lines in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Daghestan and Georgia, which used standardized designs based on traditional motifs, provided on scalepaper cartoons by specialized artists.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In 1927, the Azerbaijani Carpet Association was founded as a division of the Azerbaijani Art Association. At their factories, wool and cotton were processed and handed out to the weavers, who had to join the association.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zollinger|first1=Werner|last2=Kerimov|first2=Latif|last3=Azadi|first3=Siawosh U.|title=Azerbaijani-Caucasian rugs|date=2001|publisher=Ulmke Collection|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-3925813108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azerbaijani scholar [[Latif Karimov]] wrote&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; that between 1961 and 1963, a technical college devoted to teaching carpet weaving was built, in 1961, the National Azerbaijan M.A. Aliev Institute of Art opened a department headed by Karimov, which specialized on the training of carpet designers.

Detailed ethnographic information is available from the works of ethnologists like [[Vsevolod Miller]] and Soviet Russian surveys conducted by the [[Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography]] (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Field|first1=H.|title=Contributions to the Anthropology of the Caucasus.|journal=Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology|date=1953|volume=1|issue=48|publisher=Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, during the long period of industrial production, the connection between specific designs and their ethnic and geographic origins may have been lost. Research was published mainly in Russian language, and still is not fully available to non-Russian speaking scientists.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; From a Western perspective, when scientific interest started to develop in Oriental rugs by the end of the nineteenth century, the Caucasian regions, being part of the Soviet Union, closed up to the West. Thus, Western information about carpet weaving in the Caucasian countries was not as detailed as from other regions of the "carpet belt".&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"/&gt;

Different classifications have been proposed, however, many trade names and labels have been kept merely as terms of convenience, and future research may allow for more precise classification.&lt;ref name="Schurmann, Caucasian 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schurmann|first1=Ulrich|title=Caucasian Rugs.|date=1974|publisher=Crosby|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0903580151|edition=3rd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright, Caucasus 1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Rugs and flatweaves of the Transcaucasus : a commentary|date=1980|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|isbn=978-0960421008|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, archival research from earlier Russian and Soviet sources has been included,&lt;ref name="Wright and Wertime, Caucasian 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wertime|first2=John T.|title=Caucasian carpets &amp; covers : the weaving culture|date=1995|publisher=Hali Publ. in ass. with King|location=London|isbn=978-1856690775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperations were initiated between Western and Azerbaijani experts.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; They propose the study of flatweaves as the major indigenous folk art of the Caucasus, and worked on more specific and detailed classifications.

==== Classification by Zollinger, Karimov, and Azadi ====

Zollinger, Kerimov and Azadi propose a classification for Caucasian rugs woven from the late 19th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; Essentially, they focus on six provenances:

* '''Kuba''' relates to a district and its town, located between Baku and Derbent, the Samur river constituting its northern, the southern crest of the Caucasus its southern border.Kuba borders the Baku district in the southeast, and the Caspian Sea n the east. Kuba rugs are classified as town rugs, with dense ornamentation, high knot density, and short pile. Warps are made of wool, not dyed and dark ivory. Wefts are of wool, wool and cotton, or cotton. One of two wefts is often deeply depressed. Knots are symmetrical. Plain-woven Soumakh ends of dark wool or light blue cotton are frequent, white cotton soumakhs are rare. The fringes are braided, pleated, or artistically knotted. The selvedges are mainly round (in that case, in dark blue wool) or 0.3–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide and made of light blue wool, reinforced over two ribs by figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The colours are dark and the rugs look hardly polychrome despite the fact that they use 10–12 different colours, because their ornaments are small and arranged densely on the rug. The majority of Kuba rugs have a dark blue background. Red or dark red rarely occur, sometimes ivory, rarely yellow and hardly any green.
* '''Shirvan''' is the name of the town and province, located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, east of the Kura river, between the southern part of the river and the city of Derbent in the north. Kerimov distinguished six districts, which weave different types of rugs. Some Shirvan rugs come with a high knot density and short pile. More coarsely woven carpets have a higher pile. Symmetrical knots are used, woven with alternate warps depressed. The weft is generally of wool, in dark ivory to brown. The ends are flat-woven, light cotton or wool sumakh. The fringes are sometimes artistically knotted. The selvedges are either round, or 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide, in white cotton, with 2–3 ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. White cotton selvedges are the most common in Shirvan rugs. Shirvan rugs may have town, or village designs, but less densely ornamented as compared to Kuba rugs, and the drawing is more sparse. Compared to Kuba rugs, Shirvan rugs are lighter, and more colourful, with a dark blue background. The borders often have a light background which is more sparsely ornamented compared to the central field. Light ivory, red or yellow rarely occur. Ivory is mainly used for prayer rugs.
* '''Gyanya''' (Genje) is a large city, located ca. {{convert|360|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku.In contrast to the more urban design of Kuba and Shirvan, rugs from other provenances have longer piles. On average, the pile of Gyanya rugs is 6–15&amp;nbsp;mm high. The warp is generally darker, mainly wool, not dyed dark or light brown. Camel hair is said to be used for warps as well. Wefts are commonly dyed light to dark brownish red. Three wefts are often shot in after each row of knots, but warps are not depressed. The upper end is often {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} long brownish-red tapestry weave, turned over and sewn on. The lower end is frequently red woolen tapestry weave, with the warp loops uncut. Selvedges are rarely round, but flat and wide, mainly dark brownish red, and consist of three ribs with figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The second most common shape is similar, but includes only two ribs. Gyanya rugs are more generously and sparsely ornamented, as compared to Kuba and Shirvan weavings. Large square, rectangular, hexagonal and octagonal patterns are set within more open space. Medallions (gul) are often hooked. The colour palette is more restricted than in Kuba and Shirvan rugs, but distributed over larger areas, so that the overall impression is more colourful.
* '''Kazak''' according to Latimov refers to a district and its center town located between the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic towards the northwest into the Republic of Georgia and towards the southwest into the Republic of Armenia. The city of Kasak lies {{convert|460|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku. The warp of Kazak rugs is of sheep wool, not dyed, rather dark ivory, sometimes camel hair is said to be used. The weft is of wool, or a blend of wool and camel hair. Sometimes wool and cotton threads are only slightly plied together to form the warp thread. Wefts are dyed mostly in light red, wefts in dark blue distinguish the Kazak from Karabakh rugs. 2–6 wefts are shot in after each row of knots. The pile is wool, sometimes undyed camel hair, the knots being symmetrical, the warps not depressed. Kazak rugs are woven more coarsely, their pile being 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm high. The upper end is fastened with a 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm wide woolen tapestry weave in red colours. The lower end is often finished like the upper end, but uncut warp loops are often seen protruding from the flat-woven end. Selvedges are nearly always flat nd between 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm wide, consisting of two ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads, these often in different colours. In most cases, two double warps are wrapped three times. Kazak rugs have a limited colour palette of 5–7 colours. In general, the field has a red background, less frequently also ivory, green, blue, or yellow, the colour of the main border often in contrasting colours. The colour of the main borders is often difficult to identify due to the dense ornamentation. Kazak rugs woven before ca. 1910 have more intense and bright colours than rugs woven after this year.
* '''Karabagh''' extends between the rivers Kura and Araz up to the mountains of the small Caucasus. The rugs woven in the different regions of the Karabagh area differ substantially from each other. Rugs from the easternmost parts of the Karabagh area have cotton wefts and light blue cotton or wool selvedges. In some regions (Mokan, Talysh, Lenkoran) the rugs have runner formats, approximately three times as long as wide. Apart from manufacture rugs, Karabagh rugs have a high pile, up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. According to Karimov, some types of rugs like the "Eagle Kazak", Cloud band Kazak, or Kasymushak Kazaks, have actually been woven in Karabagh. Their upper and lower ends are often fllat-woven, folded towards the back, and sewn on.

[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two Turkmen men standing on a ''Halı'' main carpet with Tekke göl, in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]

[[Turkmen people|Turkmen tribes]] inhabited the area between the [[Amu Darya]] river, the [[Caspian Sea]], [[Aral Sea]] and towards the borders of modern-time Iran and Afghanistan. They produced rugs and smaller pile woven textiles in various sizes, including main carpets (''halı''), tent door hangings (''ensi''), and other household items like tent door decorations (''khalyk'' or ''kapunuk''), tent bags (''torba''), large bags (''chuval''), smaller bags (''mafrash''), saddle bags (''Khordjin''), animal covers (''[[asmalyk]]''), and tent bands.

Many archaic components of Turkmen representative arts have survived into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsareva|first1=Elena|title=Turkmen Carpets: Masterpieces of Steppe Art, from 16th to 19th Centuries: The Hoffmeister Collection|date=2011|publisher=Arnoldsche Art Publishers|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783897903425|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Turkmen were an ancient, Iranian-speaking ethnicity in the western Central Asian steppes and oases. Their military administrative organization in tribes was traced back to the influence of the [[Huns]].(&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atayev|first1=K.|title=Nekotorye dannye po etnografii turkmen shikov|journal=Studies of the Institute of Ethnography and Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the TSSR|volume=VII|trans-title=Some ethnographic data on the Turkmen shikhs|location=Ashkabad|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited in&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Akbar S.|title=Islam in tribal societies : from the Atlas to the Indus|date=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Paul|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0710093202|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Turkish influence came with the [[Hephthalite Empire]] in the sixth century AD, and, to a larger extent, by the immigration of the [[Oghuz Turks]] in the ninth and tenth century AD. The Oghuz assimilated the local population, who converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"/&gt; The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the thirteenth century AD led to the destruction of the cities and agricultural irrigation systems, and reduced the Turkmen people to a nomadic lifestyle which they have kept throughout their later history, living at the borders of more powerful states like the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. Less amenable to assimilation than their neighbours, they were able to preserve much of their traditional culture. During the nineteenth century, the Turkmen came under the influence of the [[Russian Empire]]. With the end of the [[Soviet Union]], the former Turkmen socialist republic turned into the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]].

The [[History of Turkmenistan|history of the Turkmen]] tribes is characterized by migrations, alliances, intertribal warfare, even by the violent extinction of regional populations. Knowledge of both the history of a Turkmen tribe and its migrations, and the characteristics of their structure and design, often allows for the attribution of a rug or pile-woven household item to a certain tribe, and to a certain period in its history. The diversity of the colours and ornaments, as well as their potential symbolic meaning, constitutes the subject of a large, sometimes controversial, body of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jourdan|first1=Uwe|title=Oriental rugs Vol. V: Turkoman|date=1989|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1851491360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Eilland, Jr.|first2=Murray J.|title=Between the Black Desert and the Red : Turkmen carpets from the Wiedersperg collection ; [published on the occasion of an Exhibition Between the Black Desert and the Red - Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.

Typical for nomadic weaving, the wool of Turkmen rugs is of high quality, with a fairly long pile. Sheep wool, goat's hair and cotton are used for the foundation. The pile is made from wool, and often also contains silk. The predominant colour in nearly all Turkmen rugs is [[Rubia tinctorum|madder red]], which was obtained locally, and allows for dyeing in various shades. The different tribes used distinct shades of red. The predominance of the red colour in Turkmen rugs creates a monotonous impression on first sight, but the minor ornaments are woven in a great variety of colours. The most prominent ornament in Turkmen rugs is the [[Gul (design)|gul]], a medallion-like polygonal pattern which is arranged in rows all over the field. Specific gul were used as tribal emblems in a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] manner.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moshkova|first1=Valentina G.|editor1-last=O' Bannon|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Amanova Olsen|editor2-first=Ovadan K.|title=Carpets of the people of Central Asia of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries|date=1996|publisher=O'Bannon|location=Tucson|isbn=9780965342100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, main (termed “göl”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;), and secondary, less elaborate gul (termed “gül”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;) can be distinguished, “gul” being the more generic name for this type of ornament. Gul were also used depending on the type of rug or household item. Main carpets usually display the main göl of the tribe, whereas tent door covers and bags show special gul.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Primary göl in Turkmen rugs include:&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George W.|title=The Turkoman carpet|date=1974|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715607404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gülli or gushli göl: Lobed göl which includes a square ornament, from which tre-foiled ornaments on a stem protrude. Used by the Tekke, Salor and Ersari, and by some weavers of the Saryk. “Gülli” means "flower" in Turkmen, “gushli” (from “kush” or “gush”) means “bird”. 
* Tauk-Nuska göl: Divided into four quarters in diagonally opposed colours, each quarter shows two stylized animals. Common in many tribes, it is mainly used by Arabachi, Chodor, some groups of the Yomud and Ersari including the Kizil Ayak.
* Tekke göl: Design variation of the gülli göl. Round shape set on the coordinates of a dark blue lattice, which divides each gül into four sections with diagonally opposed colours.
* Saryk göl: Similar to the Tekke göl, but not arranged on a lattice framework. Often seen on Saryk main carpets, also called Chuval göl because of its use on large bags (''chuval'').
* Dyrnak göl - literally: “Comb göl”. Rhomboid göl adorned with rows of hooks, resembling combs, opposite rows of hooks are in the same colour. Used by the Yomud tribe
* Kepse göl: Used mainly by the Yomud tribe, rhomboid göl surrounded by two-coloured crenellations.
* Eagle göl: At least two, if not three groups of rugs are distinguished by this design feature, which has not yet been attributed to any specific tribe.
* "C" göls: Octagon within an octagon filled with patterns resembling the letter “C”.

Turkmen carpets can be woven with both symmetric, and asymmetric knots, open to the left and to the right. Irregular knots are also frequent, including missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, are seen, both symmetric and asymmetric. Often warps are deeply depressed. Pile, warp and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Rugs woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

The '''Salor''' confederation (consisting mainly of the Salor proper and Saryk) is believed to have lived originally in the Amu Darya valley, and the oases of southern Turkmenistan, including [[Merv]]. They used bright shades of madder red. The typical Salor göl has a lobed rosette shade, upright-cross division and motif-filling. Its four central quarters are dyed in diagonally opposed colours. The style of colouring is labelled “Central Asian”. The göl are arranged on the main field of a carpet in a way that makes them appear to “float” on the field, creating the impression of a diagonal movement.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt; A group of Turkmen carpets with common structural features were termed “'''S-group'''” and identified as Salor rugs by Mackie and Thompson.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; The carpets of the “S-group” are asymmetrically knotted, open to the left. Warps are ivory, with alternate warps deeply depressed, wefts of two-ply brown wool, occasionally dyed red. Their pile is less supple than other Turkmen rugs, fairly long. Sometimes silk is used, but rarely cotton. Red colour is mostly from madder, but lac and cochineal reds have been found.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; Older Saryk weavings often have symmetric knots.

'''Tekke''' rugs are distinguished by the use of the Tekke göl. They are asymmetrically knotted, almost always open to the right. Alternate warps are rarely deeply depressed. The red colours are dyed in madder, but also cochineal red can be found. In the nineteenth century, synthetic dyes have been used. Warps are often of ivory yarn with a large component of ivory goat's hair. The selvage is overcast in dark blue.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rautenstengel|first1=Anette|last2=Rautenstengel|first2=Volker|last3=Pakbin|first3=Ali|title=Studien zur Teppich-Kultur der Turkmen = Studies on Turkmen Carpet Culture|date=1990|publisher=A. Rautenstengel|location=Hilden|isbn=978-3980259606|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Yomud''' rugs are of a similar structure, with less depressed warps. The red field colour of Yomud rugs is more subdued with a brown hue. Knots are asymmetric, open to the left. Typical göl are ''dyrnak'' and ''kepse'' göl.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"/&gt;
The most common field colour of '''Chaudor''' rugs is a purplish chestnut brown. White appears more prominently, also dark and light blue, green and yellow. The warps are made of dark wool, whereas the wefts include white cotton. Knotting is asymmetrical and open to the right, which helps distinguishing Chaudor from Yomud rugs. Tauk nuska göls are common in Chaudor rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munkacsi|first1=Kurt|title=Dividing the Chaudor|journal=Hali|date=1994|issue=26|pages=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carpet weaving tribes include the Arabatchi, Ersari and Beshiri.

==== Commercialization and revival ====

With the beginning of commercialization in the nineteenth century, carpets were produced for export in Russia and Afghanistan. Known under the trade name of “Bokhara rugs”, they show designs inspired by Turkmen carpets, but the colours and the quality of design did not match the original. With the end of the Soviet Union, national states were established in the area. Within general activities to revive the ancient tradition of hand-spinning, natural dyeing, and hand weaving, projects to support refugees from Afghanistan have taken a part in the “carpet renaissance”.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"/&gt;

The two states, India and Pakistan, separated in 1947 at the [[Partition of India]]. The tradition of carpet weaving, however, was common to the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, they are described together in this section. Unless otherwise indicated, "India" in this section refers to the Indian subcontinent.

Rug weaving was known in India at least since the sixteenth century. The original models were probably Persian, since their designs appear closely related. Other influences came from central Asia, but India soon developed a style of her own. The most elaborate carpets were woven under the [[Mughal Empire]] during the late sixteenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Further southwards, the rugs woven in the Deccan area are distinguished by their colours and design.

Pile rugs made of wool are not essential household items in the hot and humid climate of India. They might have been introduced by succeeding waves of migrants from central and western Asia. The first people to invade India from the Eurasian steppe were the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryans]] at around 1800 BC. The Aryans were nomadic people subsiding on animal breeding. It has been suggested that they might have introduced sheep breeding, and the production of woolen textiles to Northwestern India.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In the sixth century BC, India was invaded by the [[Hephthalite Empire]], another steppe nomad culture. In the fourth and fifth century BC, some areas were ruled by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. To what extent these peoples were already weaving pile carpets remains unknown, since no carpets exist from this period to support the hypothesis. The earliest references to Indian carpets come from Chinese writers during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Pinner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Denny|editor2-first=Walter|title=Indian and Kashmiri carpets before Akbar: Their perceived history|journal=Oriental carpet and textile studies|date=1987|volume=III|issue=1|pages=119–126|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Arab invasion of [[Sindh]] in 712, India came in touch with Islam. The Afghan [[Ghaznavids]] and their successors, the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghaurids]], further spread Islam in India. The Arabian geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi]] mentions carpets from Sindh in 985 AD.&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"/&gt; Carpet weaving can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Empire in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to India and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Baburs successor, [[Humayun]], took refuge in the Persian Safavid court of Shah [[Tahmasp I]]. Supported by the [[Safavid Empire]], Humayun returned to India. His son, [[Akbar]] the Great extended is power to northern India and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs.

Miniature paintings from the court of Akbar show that carpets were in use at the Mughal court. During the seventeenth century, commercial records prove the extensive trade in carpets with western Europe. Mughal carpets were depicted in period Netherlandish paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ydema|first1=Onno|title=Carpets and their datings in Netherlandish paintings : 1540-1700|date=1991|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1851491513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large number of Indian carpets still exist in European collections.

The majority of Mughal period carpets shows floral motifs, large leaf-and-blossom patterns, on a red field. Depending on their similarities with, e.g., Persian carpet designs, they are sometimes leballed “Indo-Persian”, or “Indo-Isfahan” in the literature. A large collection of Indian carpets existed at [[Jaipur]], where they were studied by T. H. Hendley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendley|first1=T.H.|title=Asian Carpets: XVI and XVII century designs from the Jaipur palaces|date=1905|publisher=W. Griggs|location=London|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these rugs were labeled, indicating the date of purchase, size, and cost. Most carpets in Jaipur had a cotton foundation, silk was sometimes used for the wefts. White cotton was used for accents in the pile. The finest carpets are often labelled as Persian, but there are carpets with an animal design which are labelled as Indian. The field is frequently dyed with lac, an insect dye resembling cochineal dye. A series of palmettes is often seen along the central vertical axis. On larger carpets, they are flanked by horizontal palmettes pointing alternately to the central axis and to the outer edges. Subsidiary figures are arranged along thin lines of scrolling vinework, usually adorned with lancet-shaped leaves. Several shades of blue are often seen, green, yellow, two different shades of red. Frequently two shades of the same colour are placed closely together with no outlining between the two colours. This feature is regarded as characteristic for Mughal Indian carpets.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The floral design of Indian carpets is often more naturalistic than in their Persian and other counterparts. This feature is considered typical for carpets woven under [[Jahangir]]. Another typical design is the "millefleurs" design, woven mainly between the seventeenth and nineteenth century. These rugs are very intricately woven, with soft wool and often with silk warps which change their colours across the width of the rug, forming vertical “rainbow” bands across the carpet. The field is covered by a multitude of fine flowerheads connected by fine vinework. Carpets with prayer rug design show elaborate vase-and-flowers arrangements flanked by cypress trees, another feature of Mughal art, also seen in architectural ornaments of Mughal period buildings like the [[Taj Mahal]]. Exact dating of Mughal period carpets is difficult, since few examples have inwoven dates. Rugs were woven in [[Agra]], [[Lahore]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

With the decline of the Mughal Empire, by the late nineteenth century, carpet weaving in India had also declined to an extent that the [[British Raj|British]] colonial administration decided to set up factories, sometimes in jails, to produce carpets for export. Carpet weaving continues in India and Pakistan after their separation and independence. Today, the carpet production in India and Pakistan frequently use foreign designs or design copies, and produce commercial rugs of mainly utilitarian value.

== The Oriental rug and the Western world ==
Oriental rugs were probably known to Europe since the [[High Middle Ages]]. Travellers' stories, court annals, home inventories and testaments and, most importantly, paintings bear evidence of rugs and carpets as goods of luxury. As such, they were absorbed into European material culture, providing a context of prestige and dignity which is still understood today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Persian Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, art historic and scientific interest in oriental rugs awoke, and they began to be regarded as genuine objects of art. Rugs were collected in museums and by private collectors, and provided the material for scientific research. Nearly every aspect of the manufacture, design, colours, and cultural significance has been, and still is, analyzed and appreciated.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the [[The Travels of Marco Polo|account of his travels]] about Anatolian rugs. Other thirteenth-century European [[Travel Literature|travellers]] who journeyed to the court of the [[Mongol Empire]] were [[André de Longjumeau]], [[William of Rubruck]] and [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] with [[Benedykt Polak]]. None of them visited China except Marco Polo. The Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] travelled with the [[Golden Horde]] and through China in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century English author [[John de Mandeville]] wrote an account of his journeys in the East. The travellers sometimes cursorily mention carpets, but only the luxurious carpets which they saw at royal courts seem to have attracted greater interest.

By the late twelfth century, the [[Republic of Venice]], strategically positioned at the head of the Adriatic, became a flourishing trade center. In 1204, [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]], led the Venetian contingent in the [[Fourth Crusade]] which ended in the [[Sack of Constantinople]], and established Venetian predominance in the trade between western Europe and the [[Islamic world]]. Occasional reports appear about carpets and rugs being bought in Venice. In a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Renaissance]] painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] mentions "two nice and large" carpets which he bought for a friend amongst other luxury goods. Objects of courtly representation and prestige initially, oriental rugs became affordable to wider groups of European citizens with the growing wealth and influence of merchant families and private persons. Inventories and testaments of Venetian citizens found in the archives document extensive collection of carpets.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|editor1-last=Carboni|editor1-first=Stefano|title=Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300124309|pages=175–191|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental rugs are depicted in a large number of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, attempts were made to determine the date when specific rugs were woven, and carpets were identified with designs similar to these reproduced in the paintings. As a rug could not have been woven later than it had appeared in a painting, the age of a carpet can be assessed by this ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra.

Only these were deemed worthy of being reproduced by artists.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Village or nomadic rugs were not depicted in paintings aiming to represent dignity and prestige, and not until the mid twentieth century was their artistic and art historic value appreciated in the Western World.

=== Collectors and scientists: late nineteenth century until today ===

In the late nineteenth century, western art historians developed scientifically productive approaches to the Oriental rug.  In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets, because Oriental carpets were not yet collected when he wrote his book, and he thought that not many ancient carpets had survived. However, Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting of oriental rugs as an art form began in the 1880s.  It was confirmed by two groundbreaking exhibitions. The first took place in Vienna in 1891, focusing on the rugs of the imperial collection of the [[House of Habsburg]], but including specimen from private collections as well.&lt;ref name="1891 Vienna exhibition catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=K. K. Österreichisches Handelsmuseum Wien (Ed.)|title=Katalog der Ausstellung Orientalischer Teppiche im K. K. Österreichischen Handelsmuseum|date=1891|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second was held in London in 1892. For the first time, the [[Ardabil Carpet]] was presented to the public.&lt;ref name="Ardabil carpet, first publication"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbing|first1=Edward Percy|title=The holy carpet of the mosque at Ardebil|date=1892|publisher=Robson &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), advised by [[William Morris]], purchased the Ardabil carpet, recognised today as one of the finest carpets in the world. The high price that was to be paid for the Ardabil carpet required public collection of money, and Oriental rugs came to be understood as objects of great value by a larger audience.

In 1882, Robinson published a book on eastern carpets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Vincent J.|title=Eastern Carpets: Twelve Early Examples with descriptive notices|date=1882|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he deployed the analytical terms that were emerging in decorative arts scholarship for the elements of carpet design, recognising medallions, floral tracery, cloud bands or the “so-called cloud pattern”, and scrollwork on the outer border.

In 1891, [[Alois Riegl]] published his book about “Ancient Oriental Carpets”.&lt;ref name="Riegl, Ancient oriental carpets, 1892"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riegl|first1=Alois|title=Altorientalische Teppiche|date=1892|publisher=A. Th. Engelhardt|isbn=3-88219-090-6|edition=Reprint 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Oriental carpets were analyzed in their geographic, cultural, and sociological context, which marks the first time when Oriental rugs were recognized as an art in itself. Following a first essay in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Ein altpersischer Teppich im Besitz der Königlichen Museen zu Berlin|journal=Jahrbuch der königlich preussischen Kunstsammlungen, Berlin|date=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Wilhelm von Bode]] published his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr.

Wilhelm von Bode's donation of his carpet collection to the Berlin Museum in 1904-5 was the foundation of the Islamic Museum, Berlin, today the [[Pergamon Museum]]. With Wilhelm von Bode as its first director, his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] created and established the “Berlin School” of history of Islamic Art. They developed the ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method for dating based on Renaissance paintings, recognized the “four social layers” of carpet production (nomadic, village, town and court manufacture) with their different approaches to design and stylization, and established the method of structural analysis to determine the historical framework of the rug weaving traditions within the Islamic world, from a Western perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K.

The London 1892 exhibition, especially the display of the Ardabil carpet, led to a growing interest in collecting oriental rugs by private collectors, who, mainly in the United States, also started publicly exhibiting their collections. Later on, private collectors donated their collections to museums. U.S. American collectors and philanthropists ([[Charles Yerkes|Charles T. Yerkes]], [[J. P. Morgan]], Joseph L. Williams, [[James F.

Many of the dealers who set up booths at these exhibitions then started galleries in America’s major cities. In New York, most of these stores were run by Armenian immigrants and concentrated in lower and mid-town Manhattan. At the turn of the century, the best known stores belonged to [[Dikran Kelekian]], [[Hagop Kevorkian]], S. Kent Costikyan and H. Michaelyan. In 1932, a group of collectors and rug enthusiasts, amongst them Arthur Dilley, Joseph McMullan, and Maurice Dimand, then curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded the ''Hajji Baba Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hajji Baba Club, New York|url=http://www.hajjibaba.org|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their exhibitions and publications, they have contributed ever since to the knowledge and appreciation of oriental rugs.

'''Paraphernalia''' most commonly refers to a group of apparatus, equipment, or furnishing used for a particular activity. For example, an avid sports fan may cover his walls with football and/or basketball paraphernalia.

==Historical legal term==
In legal language, "paraphernalia" is a term of art from older [[family law]]. The word "paraphernalia" is plural, meaning "things beyond the dowry". Paraphernalia were the [[Extra-dotal property|separate property]] of a married woman, such as [[clothing]] and [[jewellery]] "appropriate to her station", but excluding the assets that may have been included in her [[dowry]].  The term originated in [[Roman law]], but ultimately comes from Greek παράφερνα (''parapherna''), "beyond (''para'') the dowry (''phernē'')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Paraphernalia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sorts of property were considered the separate property of a married woman under [[coverture]].  A husband could not sell, appropriate, or convey good title to his wife's assets considered paraphernalia without her separate consent.  They did not become a part of her husband's [[Estate (law)|estate]] upon his death, and could be conveyed by a married woman's [[last will and testament|will]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Coffinberry v. Madden'', 30 Ind.App. 360, 66 N.E. 64 (Ind.Ct.App. 1903); [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], sub. tit. "Paraphernalia"; ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed. (West, 1979) {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in [[family law]] and [[inheritance|inheritance law]] (mirroring trends in the wider society, such as the several [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|Married Woman's Property Act]]s of the various common law jurisdiction), have generally rendered the legal concept of paraphernalia obsolete.

===In fiction===
The legal concept of paraphernalia in this sense is an important [[plot point]] in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]''. In the novel, it was a matter of some consequence whether the title jewelry was an [[heirloom (law)|heirloom]], property of the heirs, or a woman's paraphernalia, freely alienable by her.&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 25, "Mr. Dove's opinion"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4654">[[File:Phonetically-Intuitive-English-Lite.png|thumb|right|PIE running in Lite mode showing the Wikipedia article "Hamlet"]]
'''Phonetically Intuitive English''' ('''PIE''') is a scheme&lt;ref name=pie_scheme&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/using-pie/schemes The PIE scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] [[browser extension]]&lt;ref name=pie_chrome&gt;[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jafbohhbdpejlcfpkbbpkegglokegjid PIE at Chrome Web Store]&lt;/ref&gt; that automatically adds [[diacritics]] to [[English language|English]] words on Web pages to show [[pronunciation]], intended for English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) learners to learn correct pronunciations as they browse the Web, and for children in English-speaking countries to [[Reading education in the United States|learn to read]]. The free project has been reported&lt;ref name=pcworld_english&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/256680/pie_a_chrome_extension_that_can_help_with_reading_and_pronunciation.html PCWorld (English) story on PIE]&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'' and other media outlets and invited to National Education Association Exposition 2013, receiving very positive feedback from educators nationwide.

== Features ==
The [[free and open source]] browser extension&lt;ref name=pie_chrome /&gt; uses [[American English]] pronunciation data from the [[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary]] and a one-page scheme also called "Phonetically Intuitive English" (PIE)&lt;ref name=pie_scheme /&gt; to mark up English words with diacritics. The project claims that the scheme is designed to be very easy to learn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/ PIE's official project website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the English level of the user, PIE offers three modes, Full, Lite and Extra Lite, to show diacritics to different extents. The Full mode shows pronunciations to a great detail (e.g. even the silent g and h as in "light" are marked with a "silence mark"). More advanced learners may prefer the Lite mode (e.g. the silence marks on w, h, y and e will be omitted, as in "low", "she", "bay" and "take"). Very advanced learners can use the Extra Lite mode, which will further omit all schwa marks (e.g. the second and third a in "Canada" will have no marks).

{{Translation sidebar}}

In [[translation]], '''Realia ''' (plural noun) are words and expressions for culture-specific material elements. The word ''realia'' comes from medieval [[Latin]], in which it originally meant “the real things”, i.e. material things, as opposed to abstract ones. The [[Bulgaria]]n translators Vlahov and Florin, who were the first to carry out an in-depth study of realia, coined the modern sense of the word. They indicate that since realia carry a very local overtone, they often pose a challenge for translation.&lt;ref&gt;Vlahov, S. and Florin, S. “Neperovodimoe v perevode. Realii”, in [[Bruno Osimo]]. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Realia must not be confused with terminology: the latter is primarily used in the scientific literature to designate things that pertain to the scientific sphere, and usually only appears in other kinds of texts to serve a very specific stylistic purpose. Realia, on the other hand, are born in popular culture, and are increasingly found in very diverse kinds of texts. [[Fiction]], in particular, is fond of realia for the exotic touch they bring.

==Types and examples of realia==
Vlahov and Florin classify them into various categories:

===Geography===
* '''physical geography''': [[fjord]], [[mistral (wind)|mistral]], [[steppe]], [[tornado]], [[tsunami]]…
* '''geographic objects tied to man’s activity''': [[polder]]…
* '''endemic species''': [[kiwi]], [[koala]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|sequoia]], [[yeti|Abominable Snowman]]…

===Ethnography===
* '''everyday life''': [[paprika]], [[spaghetti]], [[empanada]], [[cider]], [[bistrot]], [[sauna]], [[kimono]], [[sari]], [[sombrero]], [[jeans]], [[igloo]], [[bungalow]]…

* '''art and culture''': [[kozachok]], [[tarantella]], [[banjo]], [[gong]], [[commedia dell’arte]], [[harlequin]], [[bard]], [[geisha]], [[ramadan]], [[cinco de mayo]], [[easter]], [[Santa Claus]], [[werewolf]], [[vampire]], [[mormon]], [[quaker]], [[dervish]], [[pagoda]], [[synagogue]] …
* '''ethnic characterizations''': [[cockney]], Fritz, [[gringo]], [[yankee]]…
* '''measures and money''': mile, kilometer, [[hectare]], [[gallon]], [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|perch]], [[ruble]], [[lira]], [[Spanish peseta|peseta]], [[talent (measurement)|talent]], [[Federal Reserve Note|greenback]]…&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.logos.it/pls/dictionary/linguistic_resources.cap_3_34?lang=en “Geographic and Ethnographic Realia”] “Logos”, accessed May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and society===
* '''administrative divisions''': [[region]], [[province]], [[department (administrative division)|department]], [[federated state|state]], [[county]], [[canton (country subdivision)|canton]], [[principality]], [[favela]], [[bidonville]], [[arrondissement]], [[souk]], promenade...
* '''organs and functions''': [[agora]], [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[knesset]], [[duma]], [[senate]], [[chancellor]], [[tzar]], [[shah]], [[pharaoh]], [[vizier]], [[ayatollah]], [[satrap]]…

* '''military realia''': [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]], [[phalanx formation|phalanx]], [[arquebus]], [[ak47|AK-47]], [[katyusha rocket launcher|katyusha]], [[cuirassier]]…&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.logos.it/pls/dictionary/linguistic_resources.cap_3_35?lang=en “Political and Social Realia”] “Logos”, accessed May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translating realia==

To translate realia, various strategies exist : they range from phonetic transcription to  translation of the overall meaning. Israeli scholar [[Gideon Toury]] offers one way of defining such solutions. According to his characterization, each of these can be placed between two extremes: '''adequacy''' (closeness to the original) and '''acceptability''' (making the word entirely consistent with the target culture). Here are the various possibilities at hand for translating realia:

* [[transcription (linguistics)|Transcribing]] (i.e. copying) the word, character by character. This is called [[transliteration]] when the original word is written in a different alphabet.
* Transcribing according to the target language’s pronunciation rules. For instance, the Hindi word ''Kašmir '' becomes ''cachemire'' in French.
* Creating a new word or a [[calque]], such as the English ''flea market'' inspired by the French ''marché aux puces''
* Creating a new word, analogous to the original one, but which has a more local ring to it, e.g.  ''muezzin'' from the Arabic ''mu'adhdhin''
* Using a different but related word from the source language, passing it off as the original word. For instance, the Italian word ''cappuccino'' is often translated into English as ''latte'', which in Italian means “milk”.
* Making the meaning explicit, such as ''jewish temple'' for ''synagogue''
* Replacing the word with a similar, local one, such as the French ''art nouveau'' (literally “new art”) for ''Jugendstil''
* Replacing the word with one that is more generic or international, such as ''red wine'' for ''Beaujolais''
* Adding an adjective to help the reader identify the origin of the element of realia, as in ''the Argentine pampa''
* Translating the overall meaning. For example, the English sentence ''Does the National Health Service cover this drug?'' could become, in an American context, ''Is this drug expensive?''&lt;ref&gt;Osimo, Bruno. “Manuale del Traduttore, Seconda Edizione”. Hoepli, 2004, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

How suitable each of these solutions is depends on various factors. One of them is the type of text that is being translated. Adequate translations (in Toury's sense) of realia add some exoticism, a quality that is often desirable in fiction. For non-fiction, nowadays adequacy is usually preferred to acceptability, so as to avoid the ambiguity that can arise from the use of more culturally neutral translations – though the opposite preference has prevailed in the past. One must also consider how the element of realia relates to the source culture in terms of importance and familiarity. If, for instance, it is rather common in the source culture, then providing an adequate translation creates an exotic note that wasn’t there in the first place (though this can be justified by the fact that, after all, one is not dealing with an original, but a translation). If, on the contrary, the source culture perceives the element of realia as unusual, unless the translator renders such an element more culturally neutral, readers of the translation will most likely also perceive it as unusual. Another thing to keep in mind when establishing a translation strategy is that not all languages are equally open to “foreignisms”, and how familiar speakers of that language may be with the realia one introduces. Some languages, such as Italian, welcome such words and frequently integrate them into their vocabulary. Other languages, on the contrary, have the opposite tendency: they are wary of foreign words and are very impermeable to them. French is a good example of such protectionism. Lastly, the expected readership (which may or may not be similar to that of the original) influences the choice of a suitable translation strategy. For example, the name of a chemical compound will be translated differently depending on whether one expects the text to be read by chemists or schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.logos.it/pls/dictionary/linguistic_resources.cap_3_38?lang=en “How Realia Can Be Translated”] “Logos”, accessed on May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''respective case''' (also called the '''dedative''' or '''relative''') is a [[grammatical case]] invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his [[constructed language]] [[Quenya]] (the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven language]] of the book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). It is not clear if this case is used with [[preposition]]s, [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb]]s, or has a more general use. Based on a few examples, one linguist has deduced the possibility that it is used as a kind of [[locative]] (e.g.: ''i coa i taures / i coa i tauressë'' the house in the forest).&lt;ref name="hf7"&gt;Helge Fauskanger, "[http://ardalambion.immaginario.net/ardalambion/quenya.htm#Heading7 'Quenya: L’antica lingua]'', “I sostantivi”, Gianluca Comastri, Italian trans., Ardalambion. Accessed 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible use is to translate expressions with the preposition “about.” For example, in translating “He told me about the invasion,” the Quenya word for “invasion” might appear in the respective/dedative. The seeming absence of any other case being used to translate this preposition lends support to this conjecture. In the constructed language [[Ithkuil]] the case corresponding to the preposition about is called '''Referential case'''&lt;ref name="Ithkuil-cases"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Grammar of Ithkuil Chapter 4: Case Morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hakim Abul-Majd Majdūd ibn Ādam Sanā'ī Ghaznavi''' ({{lang-fa|حکیم ابوالمجد مجدود ‌بن آدم سنایی غزنوی}}) was a [[Persian language|Persian]] poet from [[Ghazni]] who lived in Ghazni between the 11th century and the 12th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]]. He died between 1131 and 1141.&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The Later Ghaznavids'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Sanai was a [[Sunni]] Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward G. Browne]], ''A Literary History of Persia from the Earliest Times Until Firdawsh'', 543 pp., Adamant Media Corporation, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}} (see p.437)&lt;/ref&gt; He was connected with the court of the [[Ghaznavid]] [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram-shah]] who ruled 1117 – 1157.&lt;ref&gt;Ghulam Abbas Dalal, ''Ethics in Persian Poetry''. (Abhinav Publications, 1995), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He wrote an enormous quantity of mystical verse, of which ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' or ''The Hadiqat al Haqiqa'' (حدیقه الحقیقه و شریعه الطریقه) is his master work and the first Persian mystical epic of Sufism. Dedicated to [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram Shah]], the work expresses the poet's ideas on God, love, philosophy and reason.&lt;ref&gt;"Sanāʾī." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 15 Jul. 2008 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521711/Sanai&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

For close to 900 years ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' has been consistently read as a classic and employed as a [[Sufi]] textbook. According to Major T. Stephenson: "Sanai’s fame has always rested on his ''Hadiqa''; it is the best known and in the East by far the most esteemed of his works; it is in virtue of this work that he forms one of the great trio of Sufi teachers — Sanai, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], [[Jalaluddin Rumi]]."  Sanai taught that lust, greed and emotional excitement stood between humankind and divine knowledge, which was the only true reality (''Haqq'').  Love (''Ishq'') and a social conscience are for him the foundation of religion; mankind is asleep, living in a desolate world. To Sanai common religion was only habit and ritual.

Sanai's poetry had a tremendous influence upon [[Persian literature]].  He is considered the first poet to use the ''[[qasidah]]'' (ode), ''[[ghazal]]'' (lyric), and the ''masnavi'' (rhymed couplet) to express the philosophical, mystical and ethical ideas of [[Sufism]].

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Poetic influence ===
[[Rumi]] acknowledged Sanai and [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]] as his two great inspirations, saying, "[[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]] is the soul and Sanai its two eyes, I came after Sanai and Attar." ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' was also a model for [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''Makhzan al-Asrar'' (Treasury of Secrets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ḥadiqat al-ḥaqiqa is not only one of the first of a long line of Persian didactical maṯnawis, it is also one of the most popular works of its kind as the great number of copies made throughout the centuries attest. Its great impact on Persian literature is evidenced by the numerous citations from the poem occurring in mystical as well as profane works. It has been taken as a model by several other poets, including Neẓāmi, ʿAṭṭār, Rumi, Awḥadi, and Jāmi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern cultural references ===
There is a reference to Hakim Sanai's poetry near the end of the 2017 film ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' by [[Guillermo del Toro]]. In the final scene of the movie, the narrator recites a few verses of poetry without specific attribution, although there is a reference in the film's credit sequence to "Adapted works by Hakim Sanai." Researching for the [[Library of Congress]] blog ''From the Catbird Seat'', Peter Armenti confirmed with the assistance of ''Catbird'' blog readers that the poem spoken at the end of ''The Shape of Water'' is del Toro's adaptation of Priya Hemenway's translation of an original poem by Hakim Sanai. Hemenway's translation appears in ''The Book of Everything: Journey of the Heart’s Desire : Hakim Sanai’s Walled Garden of Truth'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/catbird/2018/03/who-wrote-the-poem-at-the-end-of-the-shape-of-water/|title=Who wrote the poem at the end of "The Shape of Water"? {{!}} From the Catbird Seat: Poetry &amp; Literature at the Library of Congress|date=2018-03-09|website=blogs.loc.gov|language=en-US|others=Armenti, Peter|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

* Sanai's poetry stresses the possibility of an "awakening";

''While mankind remains mere baggage in the world&lt;br&gt;
''It will be swept along, as in a boat, asleep.&lt;br&gt;
''What can they see in sleep?&lt;br&gt;
''What real merit or punishment can there be?''

* He who knows not his own soul, how shall he know the soul of another? and he who only knows hand and foot, how shall he know the Godhead? The prophets are unequal to understanding this matter; why dost thou foolishly claim to do so? When thou hast brought forward a demonstration of this subject, then thou wilt know the pure essence of the faith; otherwise what have faith and thou in common? thou hadst best be silent, and speak not folly. The learned talk nonsense all; for true religion is not woven about the feet of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Source: From: Enclosed Garden Of Truth, Edited and translated by [[John Stephenson (zoologist)|J. Stephenson]] in 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

His means for this awakening is surrender to God, his poetry has been called "the essential fragrance of the path of love". He hits out at human hypocrisy and folly;&lt;ref&gt;Osho, ''Unio Mystica'', Vol 1, Chapter 1, Rajneesh Foundation International&lt;/ref&gt;

*Others are heedless,—do thou be wise, and on this path keep thy tongue silent. The condition laid on such a one is that he should receive all food and drink from the Causer, not from the causes. Go, suffer hardship, if thou wouldst be cherished; and if not, be content with the road to Hell. None ever attained his object without enduring hardship.&lt;ref&gt;Source: From: Enclosed Garden Of Truth, Edited and translated by J. Stephenson in 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia ==
For both men and women, [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of schizophrenia onset peaks at multiple points across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For men, the highest frequency of incidence onset occurs in the early twenties and there is evidence of a second peak in the mid-thirties. For women, there is a similar pattern with peaks in the early twenties and middle age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Richard J.|last2=Addington|first2=Jean|last3=Viswanathan|first3=Ananth C.|last4=Lewis|first4=Shôn W.|last5=Cotter|first5=Jack|last6=Yung|first6=Alison R.|last7=Abel|first7=Kathryn M.|date=2016-02-16|title=How Age and Gender Predict Illness Course in a First-Episode Nonaffective Psychosis Cohort|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.14m09369|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|pages=e283–e289|doi=10.4088/jcp.14m09369|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also demonstrated a tertiary peak for women in the early sixties. Men have higher frequency rates of onset than women from the early twenties to middle age, and women have higher frequency rates of onset starting in late middle age. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=David J.|last2=Wessely|first2=Simon|last3=Murray|first3=Robin M.|date=May 1993|title=Sex and Schizophrenia: Effects of Diagnostic Stringency, and Associations with Premorbid Variables|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=05|pages=658–664|doi=10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies of [[prevalence]] rates of schizophrenia estimate that the lifetime likelihood of developing the disorder is 0.3%-0.7%, and did not find evidence of sex differences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGrath|first=J.|last2=Saha|first2=S.|last3=Chant|first3=D.|last4=Welham|first4=J.|date=2008-05-14|title=Schizophrenia: A Concise Overview of Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxn001|journal=Epidemiologic Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxn001|issn=0193-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Sukanta|last2=Chant|first2=David|last3=Welham|first3=Joy|last4=McGrath|first4=John|date=2005-05-31|title=A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=2|issue=5|pages=e141|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|issn=1549-1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical presentation ==
Symptom expression systematically differs between men and women. Women are more likely to experience high levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., low mood, [[anhedonia]], fatigue) at illness onset and over the course of illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Men are more likely to experience more [[Negative symptom|negative symptoms]] than women at illness onset.

== Course of illness and treatment outcomes ==
Age at illness onset likely contributes to observed sex differences in course of illness and treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Increased negative and [[Schizophrenia|cognitive symptoms]] and poorer overall treatment outcomes are both related to younger age at onset, while fewer negative and cognitive symptoms are associated with older age at onset.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Linda S.|last2=Harrow|first2=Martin|last3=Rosen|first3=Cherise|last4=Faull|first4=Robert|last5=Strauss|first5=Gregory P.|date=2008-11|title=Sex differences in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a 20-year longitudinal study of psychosis and recovery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=6|pages=523–529|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|issn=0010-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with the differences patterns of symptom expression observed in men and women and the relative age of onset for each gender. Men are more likely to experience poorer overall outcomes than women because of the relationship between younger age at onset and symptom severity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Clinical trials examining sex differences in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications found greater rates of symptom reduction in women compared to men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, women are at a greater risk for experiencing weight gain and developing [[metabolic syndrome]] as a result of antipsychotic medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=Donald C.|last2=Sullivan|first2=Lisa M.|last3=McEvoy|first3=Joseph P.|last4=Meyer|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Nasrallah|first5=Henry A.|last6=Daumit|first6=Gail L.|last7=Lamberti|first7=Steven|last8=D'Agostino|first8=Ralph B.|last9=Stroup|first9=Thomas S.|date=2005-12|title=A comparison of ten-year cardiac risk estimates in schizophrenia patients from the CATIE study and matched controls|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|journal=Schizophrenia Research|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–53|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|issn=0920-9964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors contributing to sex differences ==

=== Biological factors ===
The steroids and hormones associated with [[Sexual differentiation|sex differentiation]] during [[Prenatal development|fetal development]] have critical effects on neuronal development in humans, and there is evidence that these hormones have implications for sex differences in brain abnormalities observed in adults with schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have revealed more severe brain damage in men diagnosed with schizophrenia than women.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-05|title=Effects of diagnosis, laterality, and gender on brain morphology in schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=152|issue=5|pages=704–714|doi=10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, larger lateral and third ventricles and reduced volumes of critical regions such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[Prefrontal lobe|prefrontal]] cortical regions have been observed in men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These brain abnormalities likely contribute to the observed short-term and long-term memory deficits in men diagnosed with schizophrenia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Han|first1=M.|last2=Huang|first2=X.

=== Social and environmental factors ===

==== Social cognition and social functioning ====
Premorbid [[Social skills|social functioning]] and [[social cognition]], robust predictors of relapse in this population, differ significantly between men and women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsner|first=Michael S.|last2=Arbitman|first2=Marina|last3=Lisker|first3=Alexander|last4=Ponizovsky|first4=Alexander M.|date=2011-10-02|title=Ten-year quality of life outcomes among patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder II.

==== Substance abuse and dependence ====
Substance abuse is also highly correlated with poorer functional outcomes and can significantly influence the course of illness. Current research estimates that 36% of men have a history of illicit substance use versus 16% of women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablensky|first=Assen|last2=McGrath|first2=John|last3=Herrman|first3=Helen|last4=Castle|first4=David|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Evans|first6=Mandy|last7=Carr|first7=Vaughan|last8=Morgan|first8=Vera|last9=Korten|first9=Ailsa|date=2000-04|title=Psychotic Disorders in Urban Areas: An Overview of the Study on Low Prevalence Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=34|issue=2|pages=221–236|doi=10.1080/j.1440-1614.2000.00728.x|issn=0004-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine dependence is also highly prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia.

[[Image:Sapta Chakra, 1899.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The subtle body in Indian mysticism, from a [[Yoga]] manuscript in Braj Bhasa language, 1899, now in the British Library.]]

A '''subtle body''' is one of a series of psycho-spiritual constituents of living beings, according to various [[esotericism|esoteric]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings. According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle [[plane of existence]], in a [[hierarchy]] or [[great chain of being]] that culminates in the physical form.

According to ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', one of the most sacred texts of [[Hinduism]], the subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, which controls the gross physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|title=Bg 13.6-7|first=|last=pnd|date=15 July 2011|website=www.vedabase.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503130040/http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in other different spiritual traditions: "the most sacred body" (''wujud al-aqdas'') and "true and genuine body" (''jism asli haqiqi'') in [[Sufism]], "the diamond body" in [[Taoism]] and [[Vajrayana]], "the light body" or "[[rainbow body]]" in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], "the body of bliss" in [[Kriya Yoga]], and "the immortal body" (''soma athanaton'') in [[Hermeticism]].&lt;ref&gt;White.&lt;/ref&gt; The various attributes of the subtle body are frequently described in terms of often obscure [[symbol]]ism: Tantra features references to the sun and moon as well as various Indian rivers and deities, while Taoist alchemy speaks of [[dantian|cauldrons]] and cinnabar fields.

==History of the term==
The expression "subtile body" appears suddenly in English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it ceased to be used by about 1840.  At that time, the more common term "subtle body" comes into use.  The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google N-Gram|title=N-Gram Analysis, "subtile body, subtle body"|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=subtile+body%2Csubtle+body&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Csubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtile%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Csubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and what they meant by it.  But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)#Suksma sarira - subtle body]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian religions==
[[Image:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|''Drawing showing the circulation of Qi energy, Ming Dynasty'']]

The [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[tantra|Tantric]] and other systems of [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], as well as Chinese [[Taoist alchemy]] contain theories of subtle physiology having a number of focal points ([[chakra]]s, [[acupuncture points]]) connected by a series of channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]) that convey subtle breath ([[prana]], vayu, [[Qi|ch'i, ki]], [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]]).

These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through practice of various breathing and visualization exercises one is able to manipulate and direct the flow of vital force, to achieve supernormal powers ''(''[[Sanskrit]]: ''[[siddhi]]s)'' and attain higher [[Altered state of consciousness|states of consciousness]], [[immortality]], or [[Moksha|liberation]].

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:SahajaSubtleSystem.svg|thumb|An illustration of a subtle body system of seven chakras commonly adopted by contemporary yoga.]]
Early mentions of subtle body ([[Sanskrit]]: ''sūkṣma śarīra'') concepts appear in the Upanishads, particularly the earliest known theory appears in the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s (circa 4th or 5th centuries BCE) theory of five bodies or selves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taittiriya differentiates between five increasingly subtle body/selves: &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* The ''anna-maya'' ("food body", physical body/self), 
* The ''prana-maya'' (body made of vital breath or [[prana]]), 
* The ''mano-maya'' (body made of mind), 
* The ''[[Vijñāna|vijñana]]-maya'' (body made of consciousness)
* The ''ananda-maya'' (bliss body). 
The Taittiriya also contains passages which suggests a theory of a subtle internal anatomy which includes the concept of a central channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In later Vedic texts called [[Samhita|samhitas]] and [[Brahmana|brahmanas]] one also finds a theory of five "winds" or "breaths" (''vayus, [[Prana|pranas]]''):&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Prāṇa'', associated with inhalation
* ''Apāna'', associated with exhalation
* ''Uḍāna'', associated with distribution of breath within the body
* ''Samāna'', associated with digestion
* ''Vyāna'', associated with excretion of waste
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the {{IAST|Liṅga Śarīra}} is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later [[Samkhya]], [[Vedanta]], and [[Yoga]], and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or ''[[bhava]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald. ''Classical Samkhya'' p.242&lt;/ref&gt; Linga can be translated as "characteristic mark" or "impermanence" and the term [[Sarira (Vedanta)]] as "form" or "mold".&lt;ref&gt;Purucker, Gottfried. ''The Occult Glossary''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karana'' or "instrument" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of [[Isvarakrsna]] (ca. 4th century CE), the ''Lińga'' is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five [[tattva]]s from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (''buddindriya'' or ''jñānendriya'', and  ''karmendriya'' respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (''tanmatras'') The ''Samkhyakarika'' says:{{quote|The subtle body (''linga''), previously arisen, unconfined, constant, inclusive of the great one (''mahat'') etc , through the subtle elements, not having enjoyment, transmigrates, (because of) being endowed with ''bhavas'' ("conditions" or "dispositions").

As a picture (does) not (exist) without a support, or as a shadow (does) not (exist) without a post and so forth; so too the instrument (''linga'' or ''karana'') does not exist without that which is specific (i.e. a subtle body).&lt;ref&gt;Samkhyakarika, transl. Gerald Larson, vv 60-81, ''Classical Samkhya'' p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The classical [[Vedanta]] tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the [[Kosha|koshas]] "sheaths" or "coverings" which surround and obscure the self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] had little interest in working with the subtle body.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tantra]] traditions meanwhile ([[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and Buddhist yoga), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] (literally "stream or river", channels through which ''vayu'' and ''prana'' flows) and [[chakra]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (lit. "circles") which are points of focus where nadis meet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, are the central (in Hindu systems: ''susumna''; in Buddhist: ''avadhuti''), left and right (in Hindu systems: ''ida'' and ''pingala''; Buddhist: ''lalana'' and ''rasana'').&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. There are various chakra systems depending on the [[tantra]]; the ''Netra tantra'' describes six chakras, the ''Kaulajñana-nirnay''a describes eight, and the ''Kubjikamata Tantra'' describes seven (the most widely known set of chakras).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Indian subtle body terminology was adopted by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]].

The modern Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that the subtle body "is the vehicle of desires and vital forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]

In [[Buddhist Tantra]], the subtle body is termed the ‘innate body’
(''nija-deha'') or the ‘uncommon means body’ (''asadhdrana-upayadeha'').&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''sūkṣma śarīra'', rendered in Tibetan as ''traway-lu'' (transliterated ''phra ba’i lus''). &lt;ref&gt;Lama Willa B Miller. Reviews: Investigating the Subtle Body. {{cite web |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151239/https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |archivedate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels ([[nadis]]), which are conduits for energies or "winds" ([[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]] or [[prana]]) and converge at [[chakras]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  
According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three mains channels (''nadis''), central, left and right; "their beginning point is located between a person's eyebrows. From there, they run upward to the crown chakra. The passage then parallels the spine, running through all seven chakras - the centers of subtle energy - and ending about two inches below the belly button."&lt;ref&gt;Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, The Practice of Tibetan Meditation: Exercises, Visualizations, and Mantras for Health and Well-being. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2002, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; 

Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the [[Hevajra Tantra]] (8th century) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Center [i.e. cakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In contrast, the historically later [[Kalachakra|Kalachakra tantra]] describes six chakras.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during [[Deity yoga|Completion Stage]] practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western esotericism ==
=== Theosophy ===

[[H. P. Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] teaching represented the convergence of 19th century Western occultism, Eastern philosophy, religion, science, and mysticism. ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', and ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' combined the [[vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of five [[kosha]]s with Western esoteric traditions (particularly [[Neoplatonism]]).  She refers to three subtle bodies:

* ''[[Linga sarira|Linga Sharira]]'' - the Double or [[Astral body]]
* ''Mayavi-rupa'' - the "Illusion-body"
* ''Causal Body'' - the vehicle of the higher Mind

The ''Linga Sharira'' is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the [[etheric body]], [[doppelgänger]] or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called "repercussion". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.

The mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:
"the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, "Astral Bodies, or Doppelgangers". ''Collected Writings'' X, pp. 217–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of "spooks" or [[ghost|apparitions]] of the dead.

[[File:First Principles of Thesophy 066.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Vehicles of the Soul according to the Theosophist [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]].]]

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]]. For example, they divided Blavatsky's dual mayavi-rupa into two different bodies: the emotional and the mental bodies.  They also redefined some terms. The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Ancient Wisdom'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Etheric body|Etheric double]]. [[C.W. Leadbeater]], regarding the emotional body as the seat of the [[Kama (Theosophy)|kamic]] principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it [[astral body]]. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are:

* [[Etheric body]] (vehicle of [[prana]])
* [[Astral body|Emotional or astral body]] (vehicle of desires and emotions)
* [[Mental body]] (vehicle of the concrete or lower mind)
* [[Causal body]] (vehicle of the abstract or higher mind)

Each "body" has its own [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and set of [[chakra]]s, and corresponds to a particular [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]].

[[Image:Cosmicman.jpg|thumb|116px|left|The Subtle body and the cosmic man, Nepal 1600s]]

=== Post-theosophists ===

The later Theosophical arrangement was taken up by [[Alice Bailey]], and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] observed through [[Kirlian photography]] and [[Walter John Kilner|Kilner screens]]. The [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical view of the human being]] found in [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Anthroposophical]] teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.

[[Max Heindel]] divided the subtle body into: [[Etheric body|Vital Body]] made of Ether, our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside the body; the [[Desire body]], which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16&amp;nbsp;inches outside our visible body, related to the [[Astral plane|Desire World]]; and the [[Mental body]], which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold [[Soul]]. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] wrote extensively on the subtle vehicles, organizing them in accordance with the [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The common person only contains the lunar vehicles of emotion ([[astral body]]), thought ([[mental body]]), and will ([[causal body]]), concentrations of the collective animalistic intelligence, the evolution of the Essence through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. Becoming human means to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of [[Tantra]] called [[White tantrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Types of Spiritual Schools |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531203308/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |archivedate=31 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Note: The "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012401/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/component/option,com_glossary/func,view/Itemid,10077/catid,101/term,Ego/ ego]" referred to by Samael Aun Weor is not used in the same context as it is used other esoteric schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Brennan]]'s account of the subtle bodies in her books ''Hands of Light'' and ''Light Emerging'' refers to the subtle bodies as "layers" in the "Human Energy Field" or aura. Causality proceeds downwards: each of the layers has its own characteristics and can have its own expression of disease, requiring individual healing. As with the Adyar arrangement, each body or aura also has its own complement of chakras, which interrelate to those in the other layers.

Michal Levin describes the relationship between the energy bodies and the chakras in her book Meditation, Path to the Deepest Self.

=== Fourth Way ===

An interesting variant on the concept of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the "[[Fourth Way]]" teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]], where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The "soul" then is not something one is born with, but something that one has to develop through esoteric practice.

According to (Rosenthal, 1997) "In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance." The Fourth way as taught by [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]] is a philosophy of developing the divine body which is gained when one has complete understanding and self perfection. The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal ''The occult in Russian and Soviet culture'' 1997, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aleister Crowley and the Body of Light ==

The work of the ''Body of Light'' was part of English author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]], saying in his ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that it must be developed by rigid discipline, including rituals and the "assumption of god-forms", as well as by practice and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', [[Samuel Weiser]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Crowley's ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'' (Ch. 81):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes "unreal" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called "initiation:" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute''' ({{lang-sv|'''Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut'''}}, abbreviated '''SMHI''') is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency in Sweden]] and operates under the [[Ministry of the Environment (Sweden)|Ministry of the Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi About SMHI]&lt;/ref&gt; SMHI has expertise within the areas of [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] and [[oceanography]], and has extensive service and business operations within these areas.

Established in 1945, SMHI's head office is located in [[Norrköping]]. Prior to 1975 it was located in [[Stockholm]] but after a decision taken in the [[Riksdag]] in 1971 it was relocated to Norrköping in 1975. SMHI also has offices in [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]], [[Sundsvall]] and [[Upplands Väsby]]. 
To the Swedish public SMHI is mostly known for the [[weather forecast]]s in the public-service radio provided by [[Sveriges Radio]]. Many of the other major media companies in Sweden also buy weather forecasts from SMHI.

==Staff and organisation==
SMHI has about 650 employees. The research staff includes some 100 scientists at the Research Unit, where the Rossby Centre is part of. The research division is divided into six units:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/Research Research on SMHI website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meteorological prediction and analysis
* Air quality
* Oceanography
* Hydrology
* Rossby Centre (Regional and Global Climate Modelling)
* Atmospheric Remote Sensing

The regional and global climate modelling is at the Rossby Centre, which was established at SMHI in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/Research/Research-departments/climate-research-rossby-centre2-552/about-rossby-centre-1.8341 About the Rossby Centre at SMHI website]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Environmental research spans all six research units. There is also a project for providing contributions to the HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) project.

The main goal of the research division is to support the Institute and the society with research and development. The scientists participate in many national and international research projects.

==Air quality research==
The air quality research unit of SMHI has 10 scientists, all of whom have expertise in air quality, atmospheric pollution transport, and [[atmospheric pollution dispersion modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/FoUl/en/staff/staff.html Air quality research staff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419135727/http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/FoUl/en/staff/staff.html |date=2006-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the atmospheric pollution dispersion models developed by the air quality research unit are:
* the [[DISPERSION21]] model (also called [[DISPERSION 2.1]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/foretag/m/dispersion_eng.htm DISPERSION 2.1 web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413084130/http://www.smhi.se/foretag/m/dispersion_eng.htm |date=2006-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* the MATCH model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/air-quality/match-transport-and-chemistry-model-1.6831 MATCH description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/meteorologi/match_publications.htm  MATCH publications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204091748/http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/meteorologi/match_publications.htm |date=2012-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a music score, the time signature appears at the beginning as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as {{music|common-time}} or {{music|time|3|4}} (read ''common time'' and ''three-four time'', respectively), immediately following the [[key signature]] (or immediately following the [[clef]] symbol if the key signature is empty). A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a [[barline]], indicates a change of meter.

There are various types of time signatures, depending on whether the music follows regular (or symmetrical) beat patterns, including [[Time signature#Simple|simple]] (e.g., {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}}), and [[Time signature#Compound|compound]] (e.g., {{music|time|9|8}} and {{music|time|12|8}}); or involves shifting beat patterns, including [[#Complex time signatures|complex]] (e.g., {{music|time|5|4}} or {{music|time|7|8}}), [[#Mixed meters|mixed]] (e.g., {{music|time|5|8}} &amp; {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}} &amp; {{music|time|3|4}}), [[#Additive meters|additive]] (e.g., {{music|time|3+2+3|8}}), [[#Variants|fractional]] (e.g., {{music|time|{{frac|2|1|2}}|4}}), and [[#Irrational meters|irrational meters]] (e.g., {{music|time|3|10}} or {{music|time|5|24}}).

==Frequently used time signatures==
[[Image:common time signatures.gif|right|frame|Basic time signatures: {{music|time|4|4}}, also known as ''common time'' ({{music|common-time}}); {{music|time|2|2}}, ''[[alla breve]]'', also known as ''cut time'' or ''cut-common time'' ({{music|alla-breve}}); {{music|time|2|4}}; {{music|time|3|4}}; and {{music|time|6|8}}]]

=== Simple vs. compound ===

==== Simple ====
Simple time signatures consist of two numerals, one stacked above the other:
&lt;!-- Note to editors:
 We deliberately describe the lower numeral first and the upper numeral later,
 as this is clearer.  Please don't change it unless you can make it even clearer.
--&gt;
* The ''lower'' numeral indicates the note value that represents one beat (the ''beat unit'').  This number is typically a [[Power of two|power of 2]].
* The ''upper'' numeral indicates how many such beats constitute a [[bar (music)|bar]].
For instance, {{music|time|2|4}} means two [[quarter-note]] (crotchet) beats per bar, while {{music|time|3|8}} means three [[eighth-note]] (quaver) beats per bar. The most common simple time signatures are {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, and {{music|time|4|4}}.

By convention, two special symbols are sometimes used for {{music|time|4|4}} and {{music|time|2|2}}:
* The symbol {{music|common-time}} is sometimes used for {{music|time|4|4}} time, also called ''common time'' or ''imperfect time''. The symbol is derived from a [[#Early music usage|broken circle]] used in music notation from the 14th through 16th centuries, where a full circle represented what today would be written in {{music|time|3|2}} or {{music|time|3|4}} time, and was called ''tempus perfectum'' (perfect time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|Mensural time signatures]] below.
* The symbol {{music|cut-time}} is also a carry-over from the notational practice of late-Medieval and Renaissance music, where it signified ''tempus imperfectum diminutum'' (diminished imperfect time)—more precisely, a doubling of the speed, or ''proportio dupla'', in duple meter.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised and with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Medieval Academy of America, 1953): 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern notation, it is used in place of {{music|time|2|2}} and is called ''[[alla breve]]'' or, colloquially, ''cut time'' or ''cut common time''.

====Compound====
In [[Compound meter (music)|compound meter]], subdivisions (which are what the upper number represents in these meters) of the beat are in three equal parts, so that a [[dotted note]] (half again longer than a regular note) becomes the beat. The upper numeral of compound time signatures is commonly 3, 6, 9, or 12 (multiples of 3 in each beat). The lower number is most commonly an 8 (an eighth-note or quaver): as in {{music|time|9|8}} or {{music|time|12|8}}.

====Examples====
In the examples below, '''bold''' denotes a more-stressed beat, and ''italics'' denotes a less-stressed beat.

''Simple'': The meter {{music|time|3|4}} is a simple time signature that represents three quarter notes (crotchets). It is felt as
::{{music|time|3|4}}: '''one''' and ''two'' and ''three'' and ...

''Compound'': In principle, {{music|time|6|8}} comprises not three groups of two eighth notes (quavers) but two groups of three eighth-note (quaver) subdivisions. It is felt as
::{{music|time|6|8}}: '''one''' two three ''four'' five six ...

These examples assume, for simplicity, that continuous eighth notes are the prevailing note values. The rhythm of actual music is typically not as regular.

=== Duple, triple, etc. ===
Time signatures indicating ''two'' beats per bar (whether in simple or compound meter) are called [[duple time|''duple meter'']], while those with ''three'' beats to the bar are [[triple time|''triple meter'']]. Terms such as ''[[Quadruple meter|quadruple]]'' (4), ''[[Quintuple meter|quintuple]]'' (5), and so on, are also occasionally used.

===Beating time signatures===
To the ear, a bar may seem like one singular beat. For example, a fast waltz, notated in {{music|time|3|4}} time, may be described as being ''one in a bar''. Correspondingly, at slow tempos, the beat indicated by the time signature could in actual performance be divided into smaller units.

On a formal mathematical level, the time signatures of, e.g., {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|3|8}} are interchangeable. In a sense, ''all'' simple triple time signatures, such as {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, etc.—and all compound duple times, such as {{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|6|16}} and so on, are equivalent. A piece in {{music|time|3|4}} can be easily rewritten in {{music|time|3|8}}, simply by halving the length of the notes. 

:&lt;score vorbis="1" override_midi="3-4 equals 3-8 drum pattern.mid" lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \new Staff &lt;&lt;
       \new voice \relative c' {
           \clef percussion
           \time 3/4
           \tempo 4 = 100       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g4 d' d }
           \time 3/8
           \tempo 8 = 100       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g,8 d' d }
       }

           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { a16 a a a a a }
       }
   &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Other time signature rewritings are possible: most commonly a simple time signature with triplets translates into a compound meter.

:&lt;score vorbis="1" override_midi="12-8 equals 4-4 drum pattern.mid" lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \new Staff &lt;&lt;
       \new voice \relative c' {
           \clef percussion
           \time 12/8
           \tempo 4. = 66       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g4. d' g, d' }
           \numericTimeSignature
           \time 4/4
           \tempo 4 = 66       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g,4 d' g, d' }
       }
       \new voice \relative c'' {
           \override NoteHead.style = #'cross
           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a  a a a a a a }
           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } }
       }
   &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;
Though formally interchangeable, for a composer or performing musician, by convention, different time signatures often have different connotations. First, a smaller note value in the beat unit implies a more complex notation, which can affect ease of performance. Second, beaming affects the choice of actual beat divisions. It is, for example, more natural to use the quarter note/crotchet as a beat unit in {{music|time|6|4}} or {{music|time|2|2}} than the eight/quaver in {{music|time|6|8}} or {{music|time|2|4}}. {{fact|date=November 2015}} Third, time signatures are traditionally associated with different music styles—it might seem strange to notate a rock tune in {{music|time|4|8}} or {{music|time|4|2}}.

[[Paul Desmond]]'s [[jazz]] composition "[[Take Five]]", in {{music|time|5|4}} time, was one of a number of irregular-meter compositions that [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]] played. They played other compositions in {{music|time|11|4}} ("Eleven Four"), {{music|time|7|4}} ("[[Unsquare Dance]]"), and {{music|time|9|8}} ("[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]"), expressed as {{music|time|2+2+2+3|8}}. This last is an example of a work in a signature that, despite appearing merely compound triple, is actually more complex. Brubeck's title refers to the characteristic ''[[aksak]]'' meter of the Turkish ''[[karşılama]]'' dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Peter|title=Popular Musics of the Non-Western World: An Introductory Survey|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195063349|page=131|edition=rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such time signatures are only unusual in most Western music. Traditional [[music of the Balkans]] uses such meters extensively. [[Bulgarian dances]], for example, include forms with 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 22, 25 and other numbers of beats per measure. These rhythms are notated as ''[[additive rhythm]]s'' based on simple units, usually 2, 3 and 4 beats, though the notation fails to describe the [[meter (music)|metric]] "time bending" taking place, or [[compound meter (music)|compound meters]]. See [[#Additive meters|Additive meters]] below.

==Mixed meters==
While time signatures usually express a regular pattern of beat stresses continuing through a piece (or at least a section), sometimes composers place a different time signature at the beginning of each bar, resulting in music with an extremely irregular rhythmic feel. In this case, the time signatures are an aid to the performers and not ''necessarily'' an indication of meter. The Promenade from [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' (1874) is a good example. The opening measures are shown below:

[[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913) is famous for its "savage" rhythms. Five measures from "Ritual Action of the Ancestors" are shown below:

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c'' { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin" \clef treble \tempo 8 = 126 \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4 \time 3/16 r16 &lt;d c a fis d&gt;-! r16\fermata | \time 2/16 r &lt;d c a fis d&gt;-! \time 3/16 r &lt;d c a fis d&gt;8-! | r16 &lt;d c a fis d&gt;8-! | \time 2/8 &lt;d c a fis&gt;16-! &lt;e c bes g&gt;-&gt;-![ &lt;cis b aes f&gt;-! &lt;c a fis ees&gt;-!] } \new Staff \relative c { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin" \clef bass \time 3/16 d,16-! &lt;bes'' ees,&gt;^\f-! r\fermata | \time 2/16 &lt;d,, d,&gt;-! &lt;bes'' ees,&gt;-! | \time 3/16 d16-! &lt;ees cis&gt;8-! | r16 &lt;ees cis&gt;8-! | \time 2/8 d16^\sf-! &lt;ees cis&gt;-!-&gt;[ &lt;d c&gt;-! &lt;d c&gt;-!] } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

In such cases, a convention that some composers follow (e.g., [[Olivier Messiaen]], in his ''[[La Nativité du Seigneur]]'' and ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'') is to simply omit the time signature. [[Charles Ives]]'s ''[[Concord Sonata]]'' has measure bars for select passages, but the majority of the work is unbarred.

Some pieces have no time signature, as there is no discernible meter. This is sometimes known as [[free time (music)|''free time'']]. Sometimes one is provided (usually {{music|time|4|4}}) so that the performer finds the piece easier to read, and simply has "free time" written as a direction. Sometimes the word ''FREE'' is written downwards on the staff to indicate the piece is in free time. [[Erik Satie]] wrote many compositions that are ostensibly in free time but actually follow an unstated and unchanging simple time signature. Later composers used this device more effectively, writing music almost devoid of a discernibly regular pulse.

If two time signatures alternate repeatedly, sometimes the two signatures are placed together at the beginning of the piece or section, as shown below:

:[[File:Tchaikovsky String Quartet in F excerpt.png|center|thumb|460px|Detail of score of Tchaikovsky's [[String Quartet No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|String Quartet No.&amp;nbsp;2 in F major]], showing a multiple time signature]]

==Additive meters==
To indicate more complex patterns of stresses, such as [[additive rhythm]]s, more complex time signatures can be used. Additive meters have a pattern of [[Beat (music)|beats]] that subdivide into smaller, irregular groups. Such meters are sometimes called ''imperfect'', in contrast to ''perfect meters'', in which the [[Bar (music)|bar]] is first divided into equal units.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner Read, ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, Inc., 1964): {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the time signature {{music|time|3+2+3|8}} means that there are 8 quaver beats in the bar, divided as the first of a group of three eighth notes (quavers) that are stressed, then the first of a group of two, then first of a group of three again. The stress pattern is usually counted as 

:: {{music|time|3+2+3|8}}: '''one''' two three ''one'' two ''one'' two three ...

This kind of time signature is commonly used to notate folk and non-Western types of music. In classical music, [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] have used such time signatures in their works. The first movement of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s [[Piano Trio (Ravel)|Piano Trio in A Minor]] is written in {{music|time|8|8}}, in which the beats are likewise subdivided into {{serif|'''3+2+3'''}} to reflect [[Basque music|Basque]] dance rhythms.

Romanian [[musicologist]] [[Constantin Brăiloiu]] had a special interest in compound time signatures, developed while studying the [[Traditional music of Romania|traditional music]] of certain regions in his country. While investigating the origins of such unusual meters, he learned that they were even more characteristic of the traditional music of neighboring peoples (e.g., the [[Bulgarian Folk Music|Bulgarians]]). He suggested that such timings can be regarded as compounds of simple two-beat and three-beat meters, where an accent falls on every first beat, even though, for example in [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian music]], beat lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4 are used in the metric description. In addition, when focused only on stressed beats, simple time signatures can count as beats in a slower, compound time. However, there are two different-length beats in this resulting compound time, a one half-again longer than the short beat (or conversely, the short beat is {{frac|2|3}} the value of the long). This type of meter is called ''[[aksak]]'' (the Turkish word for "limping"), ''impeded'', ''jolting'', or ''shaking'', and is described as an ''irregular bichronic rhythm''. A certain amount of confusion for Western musicians is inevitable, since a measure they would likely regard as {{music|time|7|16}}, for example, is a three-beat measure in ''aksak'', with one long and two short beats (with subdivisions of {{serif|'''2+2+3'''}}, {{serif|'''2+3+2'''}}, or {{serif|'''3+2+2'''}}).&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Brăiloiu, ''Le rythme Aksak'', ''Revue de Musicologie'' 33, nos. 99 and 100 (December 1951): 71–108. Citation on pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk music may make use of metric time bends, so that the proportions of the performed metric beat time lengths differ from the exact proportions indicated by the metric. Depending on playing style of the same meter, the time bend can vary from non-existent to considerable; in the latter case, some musicologists may want to assign a different meter. For example, the Bulgarian tune "[[Bulgarian dances|Eleno Mome]]" is written in one of three forms: (1) {{serif|'''7 {{=}} 2+2+1+2'''}}, (2) {{serif|'''13 {{=}} 4+4+2+3'''}}, or (3) {{serif|'''12 {{=}} 3+4+2+3'''}}, but an actual performance (e.g., [https://folkways.si.edu/eleno-mome/world/music/track/smithsonian Smithsonian Eleno Mome]) may be closer to {{serif|'''4+4+2+3'''}}. The Macedonian {{serif|'''[[Leventikos|3+2+2+3+2]]'''}} meter is even more complicated, with heavier time bends, and use of quadruples on the threes. The metric beat time proportions may vary with the speed that the tune is played. The Swedish [[Polska (dance)|Boda Polska]] (Polska from the parish Boda) has a typical elongated second beat.

In Western classical music, metric time bend is used in the performance of the [[Viennese Waltz]]. Most Western music uses metric ratios of 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 (two-, three- or four-beat time signatures)—in other words, integer ratios that make all beats equal in time length. So, relative to that, 3:2 and 4:3 ratios correspond to very distinctive metric rhythm profiles. Complex accentuation occurs in Western music, but as [[syncopation]] rather than as part of the metric accentuation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Brăiloiu borrowed a term from [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] medieval music theory: ''aksak''. Such compound time signatures fall under the "aksak rhythm" category that he introduced along with a couple more that should describe the rhythm figures in traditional music.&lt;ref name="Oprea"&gt;Gheorghe Oprea, ''Folclorul muzical românesc'' (Bucharest: Ed. Muzicala, 2002), {{Page needed|date=January 2010}} {{ISBN|973-42-0304-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Brăiloiu revived had moderate success worldwide, but in Eastern Europe it is still frequently used. However, aksak rhythm figures occur not only in a few European countries, but on all continents, featuring various combinations of the two and three sequences. The longest are in Bulgaria. The shortest aksak rhythm figures follow the five-beat timing, comprising a two and a three (or three and two).

Irrational time signatures (rarely, "non-dyadic time signatures") are used for so-called ''irrational bar lengths'',&lt;ref name="Sospeso"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014850/http://www.sospeso.com/contents/articles/ferneyhough_p1.html "Brian Ferneyhough"], ''The Ensemble Sospeso''&lt;/ref&gt; that have a [[denominator]] that is not a [[power of two]] (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.).

These signatures are of utility only when juxtaposed with other signatures with varying denominators; a piece written entirely in {{music|time|4|3}}, say, could be more legibly written out in {{music|time|4|4}}.

According to [[Brian Ferneyhough]], [[metric modulation]] is "a somewhat distant analogy" to his own use of "irrational time signatures" as a sort of rhythmic dissonance.&lt;ref name="Sospeso"/&gt; It is arguable whether the use of these signatures makes metric relationships clearer or more obscure to the musician; it is always possible to write a passage using non-irrational signatures by specifying a relationship between some note length in the previous bar and some other in the succeeding one. Sometimes, successive metric relationships between bars are so convoluted that the pure use of irrational signatures would quickly render the notation extremely hard to penetrate. Good examples, written entirely in conventional signatures with the aid of between-bar specified metric relationships, occur a number of times in [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]' opera [[Nixon in China (opera)|''Nixon in China'']] (1987), where the sole use of irrational signatures would quickly produce massive numerators and denominators.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Historically, this device has been prefigured wherever composers wrote [[tuplets]]. For example, a {{music|time|2|4}} bar of 3 triplet crotchets could arguably be written as a bar of {{music|time|3|6}}. [[Henry Cowell]]'s piano piece ''Fabric'' (1920) employs separate divisions of the bar (anything from 1 to 9) for the three [[contrapuntal]] parts, using a scheme of shaped [[Notehead|noteheads]] to visually clarify the differences, but the pioneering of these signatures is largely due to [[Brian Ferneyhough]], who says that he finds that "such 'irrational' measures serve as a useful buffer between local changes of event density and actual changes of base [[tempo]]".&lt;ref name="Sospeso"/&gt; [[Thomas Adès]] has also used them extensively—for example in ''[[Traced Overhead]]'' (1996), the second movement of which contains, among more conventional meters, bars in such signatures as {{music|time|2|6}}, {{music|time|9|14}} and {{music|time|5|24}}.

A gradual process of diffusion into less rarefied musical circles seems underway.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--A single quirky example hardly consistutes a trend. Who thinks there is one?--&gt; For example, [[John Pickard (composer)|John Pickard]]'s ''Eden'', commissioned for the 2005 finals of the [[National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain]] contains bars of {{music|time|3|10}} and {{music|time|7|12}}.&lt;ref&gt;John Pickard: Eden, full score, Kirklees Music, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notationally, rather than using Cowell's elaborate series of notehead shapes, the same convention has been invoked as when normal tuplets are written; for example, one beat in {{music|time|4|5}} is written as a normal quarter note, four quarter notes complete the bar, but the whole bar lasts only {{frac|4|5}} of a reference [[whole note]], and a beat {{frac|1|5}} of one (or {{frac|4|5}} of a normal quarter note). This is notated in exactly the same way that one would write if one were writing the first four quarter notes of five quintuplet quarter notes.

This article uses ''irrational'' in the music theory sense, not the mathematical sense, where an [[irrational number]] is one that ''cannot'' be written as a ratio of whole numbers. However, a few pieces from [[Conlon Nancarrow]]'s ''Studies for Player Piano'' use numbers that are irrational in the mathematical sense. A piece contains a [[Canon (music)|canon]] with a part augmented in the ratio {{sqrt|42}}:1 (approximately 6.48:1). Another employs a ratio of π:e{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

|}

==Variants==
Some composers have used fractional beats: for example, the time signature {{music|time|{{frac|2|1|2}}|4}} appears in [[Carlos Chávez]]'s Piano Sonata No. 3 (1928) IV, m. 1.

[[Image:orff time signatures.gif|frame|right|Example of Orff's time signatures]]
Music educator [[Carl Orff]] proposed replacing the lower number of the time signature with an actual note image, as shown at right. This system eliminates the need for compound time signatures, which are confusing to beginners. While this notation has not been adopted by music publishers generally (except in Orff's own compositions), it is used extensively in music education textbooks. Similarly, American composers [[George Crumb]] and [[Joseph Schwantner]], among others, have used this system in many of their works.

Another possibility is to extend the barline where a time change is to take place above the top instrument's line in a score and to write the time signature there, and there only, saving the ink and effort that would have been spent writing it in each instrument's staff. [[Henryk Górecki]]'s ''Beatus Vir'' is an example of this. Alternatively, music in a large score sometimes has time signatures written as very long, thin numbers covering the whole height of the score rather than replicating it on each staff; this is an aid to the conductor, who can see signature changes more easily.

==Early music usage==

===Mensural time signatures===
In the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period in which [[mensural notation]] was used, four basic ''mensuration signs'' determined the proportion between the two main units of rhythm. There were no measure or [[bar (music)|bar]] lines in music of this period; these signs, the ancestors of modern time signatures, indicate the ratio of [[duration (music)|duration]] between different [[note value]]s. The relation between the ''breve'' and the ''semibreve'' was called '''tempus''', and the relation between the ''semibreve'' and the ''minim'' was called '''prolatio'''. The breve and the semibreve use roughly the same symbols as our modern [[double whole note]] (breve) and whole note (semibreve), but they were not limited to the same proportional values as are in use today. There are complicated rules concerning how a breve is sometimes three and sometimes two semibreves. Unlike modern notation, the duration ratios between these different values was not always 2:1; it could be either 2:1 or 3:1, and that is what, amongst other things, these mensuration signs indicated. A ratio of 3:1 was called ''complete'', perhaps a reference to the [[Trinity]], and a ratio of 2:1 was called ''incomplete''.

A circle used as a mensuration sign indicated ''tempus perfectum'' (a circle being a symbol of completeness), while an incomplete circle, resembling a letter C, indicated ''tempus imperfectum''. Assuming the breve is a beat, this corresponds to the modern concepts of [[meter (music)#Triple meter|triple meter]] and [[meter (music)#Duple meter|duple meter]], respectively. In either case, a dot in the center indicated ''prolatio perfecta'' ([[meter (music)#Compound meter|compound meter]]) while the absence of such a dot indicated ''prolatio imperfecta'' ([[meter (music)#Simple meter|simple meter]]).

A rough equivalence of these signs to modern meters would be:
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 1 (alternative).svg|13px]] corresponds to {{music|time|9|8}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 2 (alternative).svg|13px]] corresponds to {{music|time|3|4}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 3 (alternative).svg|12px]] corresponds to {{music|time|6|8}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 4 (alternative).svg|12px]] corresponds to {{music|time|2|4}} meter.

N.B.: in modern compound meters the beat is a dotted note value, such as a dotted quarter, because the ratios of the modern note value hierarchy are always 2:1. Dotted notes were never used in this way in the mensural period; the main beat unit was always a simple (undotted) note value.

===Proportions===
Another set of signs in [[mensural notation]] specified the metric proportions of one section to another, similar to a [[metric modulation]]. A few common signs are shown:&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Image:Allabreve.svg|12px]] ''tempus imperfectum diminutum'', 1:2 proportion (twice as fast);
* [[Image:mensural proportion 2.svg|13px]] ''tempus perfectum diminutum'', 1:2 proportion (twice as fast);
* [[Image:mensural proportion 5.svg|22px]] or just [[Image:mensural proportion 4.svg|10px]] ''proportio tripla'', 1:3 proportion (three times as fast, similar to triplets).

Often the ratio was expressed as two numbers, one above the other,&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; looking similar to a modern time signature, though it could have values such as {{music|time|4|3}}, which a conventional time signature could not.

Some proportional signs were not used consistently from one place or century to another. In addition, certain composers delighted in creating "puzzle" compositions that were intentionally difficult to decipher.

In particular, when the sign [[Image:Allabreve.svg|11px]] was encountered, the [[Pulse (music)|tactus]] (beat) changed from the usual [[semibreve]] to the [[Double whole note|breve]], a circumstance called ''alla breve''. This term has been sustained to the present day, and though now it means the beat is a [[minim (music)|minim]] (half note), in contradiction to the literal meaning of the phrase, it still indicates that the beat has changed to a longer note value.

The '''Treasure of Guarrazar''', [[Guadamur]], [[Province of Toledo]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]], is an  [[Archaeology|archeological]] find composed of twenty-six [[votive crown]]s and gold [[cross]]es that had originally been offered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by the [[Visigoth|Kings of the Visigoths]] in the seventh century in [[Hispania]], as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm Musée National du Moyen Âge, Hôtel de Cluny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}: the Musée de Cluny conserves one of the votive crowns.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king [[Reccesuinth]] with its blue [[sapphire]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[pendilia]].  Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.

The treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work,&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Guerra, T. Galligaro, A. Perea, "The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula", ''Archeometry'' '''49'''.1 (2007) pp. 53-74.&lt;/ref&gt; was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called ''Guarrazar'', in [[Guadamur]], very close to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]]. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the [[Musée de Cluny]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Fallow |first=Thomas Macall |wstitle=Crown and Coronet |volume=7 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest to the armouries of the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]] (today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.

Some comparable Visigothic [[filigree]] gold was found in 1926 at [[Torredonjimeno]] in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Described and compared in Alicia Perea, "Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures," ''Historic Metallurgy'' '''40'''.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic world]] and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.

The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King [[Reccesuinth]] and one of King [[Suinthila]]. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.

These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

*  [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
*  [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
*  [[Musée de Cluny|National Museum of the Middle Ages]], [[Paris]]: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman [[sanctuary]] or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a  Latin inscription that  mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of [[Égica]], year of the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]]). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.

According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.

'''Wave power''' is the capture of energy of [[wind wave]]s to do useful [[mechanical work|work]] – for example, [[electricity generation]], [[water desalination]], or [[pump]]ing water. A machine that exploits wave [[power (physics)|power]] is a '''wave energy converter''' (WEC).

Wave power is distinct from [[tidal power]], which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from [[ocean currents]] which are caused by other forces including [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[cabbeling]], and differences in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]].

Wave-power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology, although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-tidal3.php|title=Wave and Tidal Energy Experiments in San Francisco and Santa Cruz|author=Christine Miller|accessdate=2008-08-16|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the world's first commercial Wave Power Device, the [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed on the coast of [[Islay]] in Scotland and connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edie.net/news/0/Worlds-first-commercial-wave-power-station-activated-in-Scotland/3492/&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator [[wave farm]] was opened in Portugal at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Lima.

Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave [[crest (physics)|crest]], as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the [[shear stress]] causes the growth of the waves.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

[[Wave height]] is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".

In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, [[wavelength]], and water [[density]].

[[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Oscillatory motion]] is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for [[standing waves]] ([[clapotis]]) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing [[microseism]]s.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book| first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=0-521-29801-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.

The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the [[group velocity]]. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy [[flux]] (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).

=== Wave power formula ===

In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the [[wavelength]], the wave [[energy flux]] is&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The energy flux is &lt;math&gt;P = \tfrac{1}{16} \rho g H_{m0}^2 c_g,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; the group velocity, see {{Cite book

}} The group velocity is &lt;math&gt;c_g=\tfrac{g}{4\pi}T&lt;/math&gt;, see the collapsed table "''Properties of gravity waves on the surface of deep water, shallow water and at intermediate depth, according to linear wave theory''" in the section "''[[#Wave energy and wave energy flux|Wave energy and wave energy flux]]''" below.&lt;/ref&gt;

  P = \frac{\rho g^2}{64\pi} H_{m0}^2 T_e
    \approx \left(0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} \right) H_{m0}^2\; T_e,
&lt;/math&gt;

with ''P'' the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''m0''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[significant wave height]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; the wave energy [[period (physics)|period]], ''ρ'' the water [[density]] and ''g'' the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration by gravity]]. The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the wave height. When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of [[wavefront]] length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Waves in ocean engineering|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=0080435661|pages=35–36|author=Tucker, M.J.|edition=1st|author2=Pitt, E.G. |editor=Bhattacharyya, R. |editor2=McCormick, M.E.|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/wave%20power.htm|title=Wave Power|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wave Energy Potential on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711052514/http://ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/24110728/10 Academic Study: Matching Renewable Electricity Generation with Demand: Full Report]. Scotland.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline,  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
  P \approx 0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} (3 \cdot \text{m})^2 (8 \cdot \text{s}) \approx 36 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7&amp;nbsp;MW of power across each metre of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.

=== Wave energy and wave-energy flux ===

In a [[sea state]], the average(mean) [[energy density]] per unit area of [[gravity wave]]s on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2000 | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-02-3256-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{16}\rho g H_{m0}^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Here, the factor for random waves is {{frac|1|16}}, as opposed to {{frac|1|8}} for periodic waves – as explained hereafter. For a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta=a\,\cos\, 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\,&lt;/math&gt; the wave energy density per unit horizontal area is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{2}\rho g a^2,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{8}\rho g H^2&lt;/math&gt; using the wave height &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H\,=\,2\,a\,&lt;/math&gt; for sinusoidal waves. In terms of the variance of the surface elevation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0=\sigma_\eta^2=\overline{(\eta-\bar\eta)^2}=\frac{1}{2}a^2,&lt;/math&gt; the energy density is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\rho g m_0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Turning to random waves, the last formulation of the wave energy equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is also valid (Holthuijsen, 2007, p. 40), due to [[Parseval's theorem]]. Further, the [[significant wave height]] is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_{m0}=4\sqrt{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the factor {{frac|1|16}} in the wave energy density per unit horizontal area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

where ''E'' is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the sum of [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; both contributing half to the wave energy density ''E'', as can be expected from the [[Equipartition theorem#Potential energy and harmonic oscillators|equipartition theorem]]. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few [[decimetre]]s.

As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the [[group velocity]]. As a result, the wave energy [[flux]], through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds |first=O. | authorlink=Osborne Reynolds | year=1877 |title=On the rate of progression of groups of waves and the rate at which energy is transmitted by waves | journal=Nature | volume=16 | pages=343–44 | doi = 10.1038/016341c0 |bibcode = 1877Natur..16R.341. }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | title=On progressive waves | author=Lord Rayleigh (J.

Due to the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]] for water waves under the action of gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength ''λ'', or equivalently, on the wave [[period (physics)|period]] ''T''. Further, the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth ''h''. As a result, the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water, and at intermediate depths:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda/&gt;

=== Deep-water characteristics and opportunities ===

Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the [[phase velocity]]. In [[waves and shallow water|shallow water]], for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Dean_Dalrymple&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists |author1=R.

== History ==

The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by [[Pierre-Simon Girard|Girard]] and his son.&lt;ref name=cle2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clément|year=2002 |title=Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=405–431 |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00009-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at [[Royan]], near [[Bordeaux]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/0-Archive/EWPP%20archive/1976%20Leishman%20and%20Scobie%20NEL.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Development of Wave Power|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device.&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris-Thomas |year=2007 |title=An Investigation Into the Hydrodynamic Efficiency of an Oscillating Water Column |journal=Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.1115/1.2426992 |last2=Irvin |first2=Rohan J. |last3=Thiagarajan |first3=Krish P.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=cle2002/&gt;

Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by [[Yoshio Masuda]]'s experiments in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |title=Wave Energy Research and Development at JAMSTEC|accessdate=2009-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701162330/http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which was proposed in the 1950s by Masuda.&lt;ref name=ey2006&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.iwwwfb.org/Abstracts/iwwwfb21/iwwwfb21_15.pdf |author1=Farley, F. J. M.  |author2=Rainey, R. C. T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Radical design options for wave-profiling wave energy converters |booktitle=International Workshop on Water Waves and Floating Bodies |location=Loughborough |accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]]. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were [[Stephen Salter]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Kjell Budal]] and [[Johannes Falnes]] from [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now merged into [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), [[Michael E. McCormick]] from [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]] from [[Bristol University]], Michael French from [[University of Lancaster]], [[John Nicholas Newman|Nick Newman]] and [[C. C. Mei]] from [[MIT]].

Stephen Salter's [[1974 in science|1974 invention]] became known as [[Salter's duck]] or ''nodding duck'', although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/EWPP%20archive/duck%20efficiency%20&amp;%20survival%20notes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Edinburgh Wave Energy Project|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.&lt;ref name=falnes2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falnes, J. |year=2007 |title=A review of wave-energy extraction |journal=Marine Structures |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid-connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include [http://www.aquamarinepower.com/ Aquamarine Power], [http://www.pelamiswave.com/ Pelamis Wave Power], [http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/ ScottishPower Renewables] and [http://www.wello.eu/ Wello].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern technology ==

Wave power devices are generally categorized by the '''method''' used to capture the energy of the waves, by '''location''' and by the '''power take-off system'''. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: [[hydraulic ram]], [[Peristaltic pump|elastomeric hose pump]], pump-to-shore, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric turbine]], air turbine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060523114110/http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2003/ece441/groups/g12/White_Papers/Kelly.htm Embedded Shoreline Devices and Uses as Power Generation Sources] ''Kimball, Kelly, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linear motor|linear electrical generator]]. When evaluating [[wave energy]] as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.

[[File:Wave energy concepts overview numbered.png|thumb|300px|Generic wave energy concepts: 1. Point absorber, 2. Attenuator, 3. Oscillating wave surge converter, 4. Oscillating water column, 5. Overtopping device, 6. Submerged pressure differential]]

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface of the [[water]], held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber is deﬁned as having a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. A good point absorber has the same characteristics as a good wave-maker. The wave energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to generate [[electricity]] in various ways including directly via [[linear alternator|linear generators]],&lt;ref name="Seabased"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seabased AB wave energy technology|url=http://www.seabased.com/en/technology/seabased-wave-energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters&lt;ref name="PowerBuoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PowerBuoy Technology — Ocean Power Technologies|url=http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/powerbuoy-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydraulic pumps.&lt;ref name="CETO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perth Wave Energy Project - Carnegie’s CETO Wave Energy technology|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/perth-wave-energy-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices act similarly to [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber buoys]], with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. [[Energy]] is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, [[Electromotive force|EMF]] effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt; Some of these designs incorporate [[parabolic reflector]]s as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCormick |first1=Michael E. |first2=R. Cengiz |last2=Ertekin |title=Renewable sea power: Waves, tides, and thermals – new research funding seeks to put them to work for us |journal=Mechanical Engineering |publisher=ASME |volume=131 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the [[electrical grid]] by [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] [[submarine power cable|power cables]].&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;

=== Oscillating water column ===

[[Oscillating Water Column]] devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="“grnflea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Energy From Ocean Waves|url=http://grnflea.com/extracting-energy-from-ocean-waves/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting [[birds]] and other [[marine organisms]] within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting [[benthic organism]]s, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from [[subsea cable]]s. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters are a comparatively newer technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurniawan|first=Adi|last2=Greaves|first2=Deborah|last3=Chaplin|first3=John|date=2014-12-08|title=Wave energy devices with compressible volumes|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2172/20140559|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=470|issue=2172|pages=20140559|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0559|issn=1364-5021|pmc=4241014|pmid=25484609|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47040559K}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing flexible (usually reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off fluid system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy. Their compliant nature also allows for large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the response of the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the sea floor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the [[free surface]]. Wave loads also diminish in [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing the depth of submergence for such a converter, a compromise between protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be found. Submerged WECs also have the potential to reduce the impact on marine amenity and navigation, as they are not at the surface. Examples of submerged pressure differential converters include [http://www.m3wave.com/m3tech M3 Wave], [http://www.bomborawave.com Bombora Wave Power]'s mWave, and [http://calwave.energy CalWave].

== Environmental effects ==

{{further|Environmental impact of electricity generation#Wave}}

Common environmental concerns associated with [[marine energy]] developments include:

* The risk of [[marine mammal]]s and [[fish]] being struck by tidal [[turbine]] blades;
* The effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices;
* The physical presence of [[marine energy]] projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabird]]s with attraction or avoidance;
* The potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]].

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=November 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==

The worldwide resource of coastal wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Kester |last2=Stock-Williams |first2=Clym |date=August 2012 |title=Quantifying the global wave power resource |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112001310 |journal=Renewable Energy |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=44 |pages=296–304 |access-date=27 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south [[temperate zones]] have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing [[westerlies]] in these zones blow strongest in winter.

[[File:World wave energy resource map.png|thumb|World wave energy resource map]]

== Challenges ==

There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly.&lt;ref name="ocs"/&gt; Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/mre/background.asp Marine Renewable Energy Programme], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Retrieved 2011-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Hackett]]:''Economic and Social Considerations for Wave Energy Development in California'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-500-2008-083/CEC-500-2008-083.PDF CEC Report Nov 2008] Ch2, pp22-44 [[California Energy Commission]]|Retrieved 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"/&gt; Since 2008, Seabased Industry AB (SIAB) has deployed several units of wave energy converters (WECs) manufactured with different designs. Offshore deployments of WECs and underswater substation are being complicated procedures. SIAB discussed these deployments in terms of economy and time efficiency, as well as safety. Certain solutions are suggested for the various problems encountered during the deployments. It is found that the offshore deployment process can be optimized in terms of cost, time efficiency and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzigiannakou|first=Maria Angeliki|last2=Dolguntseva|first2=Irina|last3=Leijon|first3=Mats|date=2017-03-25|title=Offshore Deployments of Wave Energy Converters by Seabased Industry AB|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/5/2/15|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.3390/jmse5020015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave farms ==

{{Main|Wave farm}}A group of wave energy devices deployed in the same location is called [[wave farm]], wave power farm or wave energy park. Wave farms represent a solution to achieve larger electricity production. The devices of a park are going to interact with each other hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, the distance among them, the geometric layout, the wave climate, the local geometry,  the control strategies. The design process of a wave energy farm is a multi-[[optimization problem]] with the aim to get a high power production and low costs and power fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giassi|first=Marianna|last2=Göteman|first2=Malin|date=April 2018|title=Layout design of wave energy parks by a genetic algorithm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=154|pages=252–261|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first machine was launched in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Fyall, Jenny | title = 600ft 'sea snake' to harness power of Scotland |work=The Scotsman | date = May 19, 2010 | pages = 10–11 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/600ft-39sea-snake39-to-harness.6303096.jp | accessdate = 2010-05-19 | location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A facility known as [[Wave hub]] has been constructed off the north coast of Cornwall, England, to facilitate wave energy development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19751">'''Women in geology''' concerns the history and contributions of [[Woman|women]] to the field of [[geology]]. There has been a long history of women in the field, but they have tended to be under-represented. In the era before the eighteenth century, science and geological science had not been as formalized as they would become later. Hence early geologists tended to be informal observers and collectors, whether they were male or female. Notable examples of this period include [[Hildegard of Bingen]] who wrote works concerning stones and [[Barbara Uthmann]] who supervised her husband's mining operations after his death. Mrs. Uthmann was also a relative of [[Georg Agricola]]. In addition to these names varied aristocratic women had scientific collections of rocks or minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kölbl-Ebert|first1=M.|title=On the origin of women geologists by means of social selection: German and British comparison|journal=Episodes|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=3|pages=182&amp;ndash;193|url=http://www.episodes.org/index.php/epi/article/view/62654/48865|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century a new professional class of geologists emerged that included women. In this period the British tended to have far more women of significance to geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R. S.|last2=Creese|first2=Thomas M.|title=British women who contributed to research in the geological sciences in the nineteenth century|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=5 January 2009|volume=27|issue=01|page=23|doi=10.1017/S0007087400031654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the [[Association for Women Geoscientists]] was formed to support women in this field as they remained under-represented. There have been advances since then although retention remains a problem.
