      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">{{Sexual orientation}}'''Against Nature?''' is an exhibition on [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexuality in animals]] made by the [[Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo|Natural History Museum]], [[University of Oslo]], [[Norway]]. The exhibition focuses on occurrence and function of homosexuality in animals, and is the first of its kind.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==History==
The exhibit contains pictures, animals and models of [[List of animals displaying homosexual behavior|species known to engage in homosexuality]], showing among other things [[southern right whale]]s and [[giraffe]]s engaged in same-sex pairing. The museum says one of its aims is to "help to de-mystify homosexuality among people... we hope to reject the all too well known argument that homosexual behaviour is a crime against nature." Most of the exhibition is based on the works of [[Bruce Bagemihl]] and [[Joan Roughgarden]].

The exhibition was initiated by the [[Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority]] (ABM) as part of their "Break" program, encouraging museums, libraries and archives to do research and exhibitions of controversial and taboo subjects. The exhibition is a direct answer to this challenge, and has received financial support from ABM. The exhibition ran from September 2006 to August 2007.

==Reception==
It was well received, including by the museum's regular visiting groups, mainly families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6066606.stm Europe | Oslo gay animal show draws crowds]. BBC News (2006-10-19). Retrieved on 2011-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit has been on show in Oslo, [[Bergen]], [[Trondheim]], [[Maastricht]], [[Genova]] and in [[Stockholm]] (in the last as "Rainbow Animals"). The exhibition has been criticized by some [[philosophy]] scholars, who state that the exhibit as misses the point of the original terminology attributed to homosexual activity as "against nature".  Such activity was most properly said to be against nature because it was using the reproductive power for essentially un-reproductive acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/heyj.12246 | volume=56 | title=Is Sodomy Against Nature?

The '''Atomic Energy Research Establishment''', known as '''AERE''' or colloquially '''Harwell Laboratory''', near [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], was the main [[Headquarters|centre]] for [[nuclear power|atomic energy]] [[research and development]] in the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1940s to the 1990s.

==Founding==
In 1945 [[John Cockcroft]] was asked to set up a research laboratory to further the use of [[nuclear fission]] for both [[military]] purposes and generating energy. The criteria for selection involved finding somewhere remote with a good water supply, but within reach of good transport links and a university with a [[nuclear physics]] laboratory. This more or less limited the choice to the areas around [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]]. It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better [[nuclear physics]] facility (the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the [[Cold War]], therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. [[RAF Harwell]] was sixteen miles south of [[Oxford]] near [[Didcot]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the [[Ministry of Supply]]. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].

The early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by [[Egon Bretscher]], later by Robert Spence), General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by [[Otto Frisch]], later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics ([[Klaus Fuchs]], later [[Brian Flowers]] and [[Walter_Marshall,_Baron_Marshall_of_Goring|Walter Marshall]], Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S.

Directors after Cockcroft included [[Basil Schonland]], Sir [[Arthur Vick]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]].

[[File:Aere harwell main gate.jpg|thumb|AERE main gate]]
The decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as 'The Atomic') became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House ('B' mess, the RAF sergeants' mess), Portway House ('C' Mess, the RAF airmans' mess) and Ridgeway House ('A' Mess, the officers' mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred '[[Prefabricated building|Prefabs]]', single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of 'Prefabs' were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]] (near [[Wantage]]) and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The 'Prefab' estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.

Workers were bussed to the site from as far away as Reading in utilitarian grey buses marked 'AERE'.

==Early reactors==
{{main|DIDO (nuclear reactor)|GLEEP|PLUTO reactor}}
Such was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, [[GLEEP]], was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3 [[kilowatt]]) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990. The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Atomic Pile Heat Warms Buildings"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor to GLEEP, called [[BEPO]] (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. BEPO was shut down in 1968.

[[LIDO reactor|LIDO]] was an [[enriched uranium]] thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.

A pair of larger 26 [[megawatt|MW]] reactors, [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and [[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], which used enriched [[uranium]] with a [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense [[neutron]] irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of.   A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial [[isotope]] production from BEPO after that was shut down.  DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed.  The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.

==Zeta==
One of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] [[fusion power]] experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see [[Timeline of nuclear fusion]]).

==Organisational history==
In 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).

During the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAIlXPgcsHwC&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;ots=1aT_-RwA1c&amp;dq=%22Route%20program%20sends%20profits%20sailing%20ahead%22&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;f=false "Route program sends profits sailing ahead"], New Scientist 3 Feb 1972 p268&lt;/ref&gt; and oil reservoir   simulation software to help in the development of the UK's North Sea oil interests&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aNRaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=harwell+oil+reservoir+simulator&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Atomic+Energy+Authority+Research "Winning More Oil: Increasing Importance for Enhanced Oil Recovery"] auth. Ray Dafter, pub. Financial Times Business Information Limited, 1981, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;. UKAEA was ordered to operate on a [[Trading Fund]] basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as [[AEA Technology]] and floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.

[[File:Aere harwell national chemical landmark.jpg|thumb|right|Harwell Laboratory blue plaque]]
The name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the ''Harwell International Business Centre''. The site incorporates the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the [[ISIS neutron source]] and [[Diamond Light Source]]). In 2006, the name [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of [[Magnox Ltd]]), on their behalf.

The '''Balsillie School of International Affairs''' ('''BSIA''') is a centre for advanced research and teaching on global governance and international public policy, located in [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. The school is a collaborative partnership between [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], the [[University of Waterloo]], and the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]]. The BSIA is housed in the north and west wings of the [[CIGI Campus]] building.

== History ==
The BSIA partnership was announced in 2007 when [[Research In Motion]]  co-CEO and CIGI Founder [[Jim Balsillie]] donated $50 million to the initiative. [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] and the [[University of Waterloo]] would also make investments toward the school totalling $50 million ($25 million from each) over the next decade. From 2007-11, classes at the BSIA took place at WLU and UW.

In 2009, plans were announced to house the BSIA within a "CIGI Campus" that would be built alongside the think tank's headquarters in Waterloo. The resulting $68 million complex received federal and provincial funding totalling $50 million through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program and Ontario's 2009 Budget. The City of Waterloo donated the land for the campus through a 99-year lease.

Construction began in 2009 and lasted for approximately two years. In October 2011, the BSIA held its first classes in the CIGI Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.thecord.ca/?p=3618 |title= CIGI opens 114,000 sq. foot campus in Waterloo, featuring Balsillie School|newspaper= [[The Cord Weekly]]|date= 2011-09-21|accessdate= 2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==

Canadian international relations scholars have ranked the Balsillie School the 4th best school in Canada for students seeking a career in public policy, as well as the 4th best school in Canada for students seeking an academic career studying international relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://opencanada.org/features/canadas-ir-scholars-who-they-are-and-where-they-think-you-should-go-to-school/ Retrieved on 2015-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who were polled noted both that the Balsillie School has gained prominence rapidly since its founding in 2007, and has attained a reputation for being well-funded.

== Academic Programs ==
The BSIA, with its degree-granting partners WLU and UW, offers three degrees programs:
* The joint university ''PhD in Global Governance'' (offered by WLU and UW) offers specialization in one of six fields: global political economy, global environment, conflict and security, global justice and human rights, multilateral institutions and diplomacy, and global social governance.
* The one year, intensive ''Master's in International Public Policy'' (offered by WLU) provides graduate training for global policy development, implementation and training.
* The ''Master of Arts in Global Governance'' (offered by UW), designed to be completed in 16 months, consists of two terms of course work, a third term in which students complete a major research paper, and an internship in a fourth term.

== Faculty and Personnel ==
The inaugural director of the BSIA was Ramesh Thakur, a former CIGI fellow and vice-rector at the [[United Nations University]]. In 2010, he was succeeded by David A. Welch, CIGI chair of global security and professor of political science at UW. The current director of BSIA is [[John Ravenhill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.balsillieschool.ca/people/john-ravenhill John Ravenhill | Balsillie School of International Affairs]. Balsillieschool.ca.

__TOC__

==History==
Before the present building, the site was used by Bell Telephone Laboratories for research. [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] invented [[radio astronomy]] there, and a monument was placed at the former location {{nowrap|({{coord|40|21|54.5|N|74|09|48.9|W|type:landmark_region:US-NJ|display=inline}})}} of the [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] almost seventy years later in 1998. The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky's antenna was at 7:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=17286 Karl Jansky Radio Astronomy Monument]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1957, the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)]] began to plan a research laboratory in Holmdel Township in [[Central New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="NYT2008"/&gt; Constructed between 1959 and 1962, this complex was one of the final projects of [[Finland|Finnish]]-American [[architect]] [[Eero Saarinen]] before his death in 1961.&lt;ref name="NYT1961"/&gt; Used as a research and development complex, it served the needs of the Bell Laboratories division of AT&amp;T, later part of [[Lucent]], and [[Alcatel-Lucent]].&lt;ref name="NYT2008"/&gt; Basic research, applied hardware development, and software development occurred in the building.

The building's distinctive features, including its mirror-like appearance, led to recognition as the Laboratory of the Year by R&amp;D in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21202521.html |title=Bell Laboratories Holmdel Complex.

The building was expanded in 1966 and 1982 to its final size of two million square feet of office and laboratory space.&lt;ref name="APP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080915/NEWS01/809150322/1004 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117041456/http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080915/NEWS01/809150322/1004 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-17 |title=Bell Labs site's future |accessdate=2008-09-27 |last=Thompson |first=Sametta |date=2008-09-15 |publisher=APP.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these expansions, the original [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] design remained intact, as did the unique layout of the site, which included a large [[ellipse|elliptical]] master plan and country-road like approach.  Over its active life-span, the facility and its layout were studied in universities as models of modernist architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/08/abandoned_bell_labs_could_make.html |title=Abandoned Bell Labs could make history again |accessdate=2008-09-27 |last=Shearn |first=Tim |date=2008-08-03|work=NJ.com |publisher=The Star-Ledger| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20081003051844/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/08/abandoned_bell_labs_could_make.html| archivedate= 3 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internally, the building is divided into four pavilions of labs and offices, each separated from the others by a cross-shaped atrium.  The internal pavilions are linked via sky-bridges and perimeter walkway.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"/&gt;

Also of note is the [[water tower]] on the complex, which was designed to look like the then-new [[transistor]] and is still in usable condition more than 40 years after its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/8180 |title=World's Largest Transistor |accessdate=2008-09-27 |date=April 2008 |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006164058/http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/8180| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Alcatel-Lucent]] contracted to sell the facility to Preferred Real Estate Investments in the process of restructuring the company's research efforts.&lt;ref name="NYT2006"/&gt;  Despite initial plans to maintain the original buildings and keep the complex as a corporate office park, economic developments later resulted in Preferred seeking to re-zone as residential property.&lt;ref name="APP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6573">[[Image:Bembine Table of Isis.png|thumb|300px|right|The '''Bembine Table of Isis'''.]]
The '''Bembine Tablet''', the '''Bembine Table of Isis''' or the '''''Mensa Isiaca''''' ('''Isiac Tablet''') is an elaborate tablet of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, most probably of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin but imitating the [[ancient Egypt]]ian style. It was named in the [[Renaissance]] after [[Cardinal Bembo]], a celebrated antiquarian who acquired it after the 1527 [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]]. Thereafter it was used by antiquarians to penetrate the meaning of [[hieroglyphics]], which were not authentically deciphered [[Jean-François Champollion|until the 19th century]]. Owing to these prior misconceptions, the tablet became of importance to western esoteric traditions.

==Origin and construction==
The ''Tablet'' is now regarded as of Roman rather than Egyptian origin, dating to some time in the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.museoegizio.it/en/the-museum|title=The Museum - Museo Egizio di Torino|work=Museo Egizio di Torino|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of its subsequent history until after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]], when Cardinal Bembo acquired it from a certain locksmith or ironworker into whose hands it had fallen. After Bembo's death in 1547, the ''Tablet'' was acquired by the [[Duke of Mantua|Gonzaga rulers of Mantua]], remaining in their museum until the capture of the city in 1630 by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]'s troops. It then passed through various hands until the French conquest of Italy in 1797. [[Alexandre Lenoir]] mentioned in 1809 that it was on exhibition in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]. After Napoleon's downfall it was returned to [[Italy]] to become a central exhibit in what is now the [[Museo Egizio]] at Turin, where it has remained.&lt;ref&gt;William Bates, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/oddnotes/bembo.html The Brazen Table of Bembo &amp; Hieroglyphics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet was made of bronze with enamel and silver inlay, the figures cut very shallow and the contours of most of them delineated with thin silver wire. The bases on which the figures sat were covered with silver, later torn away, and these sections are left blank in the engraved reproduction above.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dudley Fosbroke]], ''Encyclopædia of Antiquities''&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important example of ancient [[metallurgy]], its surface being decorated with a variety of metals including silver, gold, copper-gold alloy and various base metals. One of the metals employed is black, made by alloying copper and tin with small amounts of gold and silver, and then 'pickling' it in organic [[acid]]. This black metal is possibly a variety of the "[[Corinthian bronze]]" described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Plutarch]].

==Interpretations==
[[Image:Bembine Levi.png|thumb|right|[[Eliphas Levi]]'s key to the Bembine Tablet]]
[[Image:Bembine Westcott.png|thumb|right|[[William Wynn Westcott]]'s key to the Bembine Tablet]]

Although the scenes are Egyptianising, they do not depict Egyptian rites. Figures are shown with non-customary attributes, making it unclear which are divinities and which kings or queens. Egyptian motifs are used without rhyme or reason. However, the central figure is recognisable as Isis, suggesting that the ''Tablet'' originated in some Roman centre of her worship.

One of the earliest scholars to study the tablet was [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani]], who may have seen it before it became generally known after the sack of 1527. His ''Hieroglyphica sive de sacris Aegyptiorum litteris commentarii'' seems to have been composed earlier than that, although it was published much later. The work covered the whole field of the meaning of hieroglyphics, but lacked the scholarly rigour of the antiquarian Laurentius Pignorius (1571-1631), whose ''Characteres Aegyptii, hoc est Sacrorum, quibus Aegyptii utuntur, simulachrorum accurata delineatio et explicatio'' of 1608 investigates the origin of the tablet as an archaeological object. Avoiding interpretation of the meaning, the author expressed doubt as to whether the images  were at all meaningful, in which he was subsequently proved right.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Raybould, ''Emblemata, symbolic literature of the Renaissance'', Grollier Club, New York 2009, pp.92-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]&lt;ref&gt; Kircher is described as,'probably the supreme representative of Hermeticism within the post-Reformation Church' p. 235 Baigent, M &amp;Leigh, R. The Elixir and The Stone pub. Penguin London 1997 reprinted 2005. See also - 'Athanasius Kircher:The Last Man who knew everything' ed. Paula Findlen pub. Routledge 2004 &lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]] (1652) used the tablet as a primary source for developing his translations of hieroglyphics, which are now known to be incorrect. His book was the source for the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]], who, in his discourse [[The Garden of Cyrus]] (1658) alludes to '' the figures of Isis and Osyris, and the Tutelary spirits in the Bembine Table''. Seventeenth century scholars of comparative religion such as Kircher and Browne attempted to reconcile the wisdom of antiquity with Christianity, the Bembine Tablet was interpreted as a vehicle for such syncretic thought; thus Browne proposes in his discourse - 

''Though he that considereth........ the crosse erected upon a pitcher diffusing streams of water into two basins, with sprinkling branches in them, and all described upon a two-footed Altar, as in the Hieroglyphicks of the brazen Table of ''Bembus'' will hardly decline all thought of Christian signality in them.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden1.html|title=The Garden of Cyrus: Chapter I|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}} &lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Kircher's speculations were used by several occultists, including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Manly P. Hall]], as a key to interpreting the "[[Book of Thoth]]" or [[Tarot]]. Platonistic writer [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] even claimed that this tablet formed the altar before which [[Plato]] stood as he received initiation within a subterranean hall in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;Manly Palmer Hall, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta13.htm ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages''], 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bible Review''''' was a [[magazine]] that sought to communicate the [[Biblical studies|academic study]] of the [[Bible]] to a broad general audience. Covering both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, ''Bible Review'' presented critical and historical interpretations of biblical texts, and "reader-friendly Biblical scholarship" from 1985 to 2005.  After 2005, ''Bible Review'' merged into ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. ''Bible Review'' was published by the non-denominational [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] and edited by the society's founder [[Hershel Shanks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes."

At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org.

Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a book with the most interesting cartoons and winning captions as well as comprehensive information covering this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Mankoff, Robert (2008).

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its character [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] instituting rules that no one wants to follow.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com. Retrieved June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9489">{{Other uses|Characterization (disambiguation)}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: the spelling as "characterization" with "z" is intentional (see page title!). Please do not change it to "characterisation". Cf. Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Retaining_the_existing_variety  --&gt;
'''Characterization''' or '''characterisation''' is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in [[narrative]] and [[drama]]tic [[The arts|works of art]].  This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or "dramatic") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' [[Action (narrative)|action]]s, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], or appearance.  Such a personage is called a [[Character (arts)|character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character is a [[literary element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''characterization'' was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, pp. 51-2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is, a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his ''[[Poetics]]'' that tragedy "is a representation, not of men, but of action and life." This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is, a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the [[realist novel]], and increasingly later with the influential development of [[psychology]].

==Direct vs. indirect==
There are two ways  an [[author]] can convey information about a character:
;''Direct'' or ''[[wiktionary:explicit|explicit]]'' characterization: The author literally tells the audience what a character is like. This may be done via the [[narrator]], another character or by the character themselves.
;''Indirect'' or ''[[wiktionary:implicit|implicit]]'' characterization: The audience must infer for themselves what the character is like through the character's thoughts, actions, speech (choice of words, manner of speaking), physical appearance, mannerisms and interaction with other characters, including other characters' reactions to that particular person.

==In drama==
Characters in theater, television, and film differ from those in novels in that an actor may interpret the writer's description and dialogue in their own unique way to add new layers and depth to a character. This can be seen when critics compare, for example, the 'Lady Macbeths' or 'Heathcliffs' of different actors.  Another major difference in drama is that it is not possible to 'go inside the character's head' in the way possible in a novel, meaning this method of character exposition is unavailable.  Still another is that in drama, a character usually can be seen and heard and need not be described.

==Character archetypes==
The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] identified twelve primary 'original patterns' of the human psyche. He believed that these reside in the collective subconscious of people across cultural and political boundaries. These twelve archetypes are often cited in fictional characters. [[Character (arts)#Round vs. flat|'Flat' characters]] may be considered so because they stick to a single archetype without deviating, whereas 'complex' or 'realistic' characters will combine several archetypes, with some being more dominant than others – as people are in real life.
Jung's twelve archetypes are: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Hero, the Caregiver, the Explorer, the Rebel, the Lover, the Creator, the Jester, the Sage, the Magician, and the Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html | title=The 12 Common Archetypes | work=SoulCraft | accessdate=June 29, 2016 | author=Golden, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character's voice== &lt;!-- Character's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Grammatical voice|Writer's voice}}

A '''character's voice''' is his or her manner of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characters use different vocabularies and rhythms of speech.  For example, some characters are talkative, others taciturn.  The way a character speaks can be a powerful way of revealing the character’s personality.  In theory, a reader should be able to identify which character is speaking simply from the way he or she talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a character voice has been created that is rich and distinctive, the writer can get away with omitting many speech attributions (tag lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The manner of a character’s speech is to literature what an actor’s appearance and costume are to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fiction, what a character says, as well as how he or she says it, makes a strong impression on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each character should have his or her distinctive voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate characters in fiction, the writer must show them doing and saying things, but a character must be defined by more than one single topic of conversation or by the character’s accent.  The character will have other interests or personality quirks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although individual temperament is the largest determinant of what a character says, it is not the only one.  The writer can make the characters’ dialogue more realistic and interesting by considering several factors affecting how people speak:  ethnicity, family background, region, gender, education, and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|pp=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words characterize by their diction, cadence, complexity, and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerisms and catch-phrases can help too.  Considering the degree of formality in spoken language is also useful.  Characters who spend a lot of their lives in a more formal setting often use a more formal language all the time, while others never do.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tone of voice, volume, rate of delivery, vocabulary, inflection, emphasis, pitch, topics of conversation, idioms, colloquialisms, and figures of speech:  all of these are expressions of who the character is on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A character’s manner of speech must grow from the inside out.  The speaking is how his or her essential personality leaks out for the world to see; it is not the sum total of his or her personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' project, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a public integrated [[digital library]], database, and [[search engine]] for scientific papers in [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemXSeer|work=Critical Zone Exploration Network|publisher=National Science Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn State (2007, July 26). Researchers Create Search Engine To Hunt Molecules Online |newspaper=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070726210910.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' was conceived by Dr. Prasenjit Mitra, [[Lee Giles|Dr. Lee Giles]] and Dr. Karl Mueller as a way to integrate the chemical scientific literature with experimental, analytical, and simulation data from different types of experimental systems. The goal of the project is to create an intelligent search and database which will provide access to relevant data to a diverse community of users who have a need for chemical information. It is hosted on the [[World Wide Web]] at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The [[Pennsylvania State University]].

== Features ==
In order to provide access to relevant data to users '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides new features that are not available in traditional search engines or digital libraries.
# [[Chemical molecule|Chemical Entity]] Search: A tool capable of identifying [[Chemical formula|chemical formuale]] and [[chemical name]]s, and extracting and disambiguating them from general terms within documents. Those disambiguated terms are used for performing searches.
# TableSeer: In scholarly articles Tables are used to present, list, summarize, and structure important data. TableSeer automatically identifies tables in digital documents, extracts the table [[Metadata]] as well as the cells content, and stores them in such a way that allows users to either query the table content or search for tables in a large set of documents.
# Dataset search: '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides tools to incorporate datasets from different experiments sources. The system is able to manipulate results from multiple formats such as [[XML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], and [[CHARMM]], create databases, to allow direct queries over the data, create [[Metadata]], using an annotation tool, which will allow users to search over the datasets, as well as a way to create links among datasets and/or between datasets and documents.

In addition to these tools, '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' will integrate the advances made by its sister project [[CiteSeerX|CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;]] to provide:
* Full text search
* Author, affiliation, title and venue search
* Citation and acknowledgement search
* Citation linking and statistics

The '''canon law of contract''' follows that of the civil jurisdiction in which [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] operates. (Latin ''contractus''; Old French ''contract''; Modern French ''contrat''; Italian ''contratto'').

=="Canonization" of civil contract jurisprudence==
{{see also|1983 Code of Canon Law|Contract|Law of obligations}}
Sometimes canon law makes the civil law (the law of civil society) its own, giving it the same effect in canon law as if it had actually been promulgated by canonical leglislators, subject to the ''proviso'' that such civil law does not contravene divine law.&lt;ref name=Coriden38&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 38 (commentary on Canon 22).&lt;/ref&gt; This should be considered more than "a mere recognition" of secular law; such secular law "is made into canon law."&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt;

Contract law is an area of civil jurisprudence which the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]] "canonizes".&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt; If a contract is valid in civil law, it is valid in canon law also.&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt; If a contract is rendered invalid by civil law, it is thereby rendered invalid in canon law as well.&lt;ref name=Coriden38/&gt;
{{quote|Canon 1290: Without prejudice to Can. 1547, whatever the local civil law decrees about contracts, both generally and specifically, and about the voiding of contracts, is to be observed regarding goods which are subject to the power of governance of the Church, and with the same effect, provided that the civil law is not contrary to divine law, and that canon law does not provide otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4Q.HTM Canon 1290], 1983 Code of Canon Law (Intratext), accessed 4/16/2016, released under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prior to the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|1917 Code]], canon law required that the [[Roman law]] of obligations be observed when ecclesiastical moral persons (termed "[[person (canon law)|juridic persons]]" in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|1983 Code]], except for the [[Holy See]] and the [[Catholic Church]] as such&lt;ref&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 80 (commentary on Canon 113 §1).&lt;/ref&gt;) entered into contracts.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt; Canon 1529 of the 1917 Code made a shift regarding contract law, recognizing the civil law binding in the particular territory in which a contract was made as binding in canon law as well (with certain exceptions).&lt;ref name=Coriden878&gt;Coriden, ''A Text and Commentary'', pg. 878 (commentary on Canon 1290).&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal capacity of [[person (canon law)|physical and juridic persons]] to contract comes from canon law itself, however, and not from civil law,&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt; even though the provisions of the civil contract law are observed in canon law with the same effects.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt;

Canon law, therefore, cannot be said to have a universal contractual law.&lt;ref name=Coriden878/&gt;

==Roman origins and moralist doctrine==
{{main|Roman law}}
The canonical and moralist doctrine on this subject is a development of that contained in the Roman civil law. In [[Roman law]] a mere agreement between two parties to give, do, or refrain from doing something was a nude pact (''pactum nudum'') which gave rise to no civil obligation, and no action lay to enforce it. It needed to be clothed in some investitive fact which the law recognized in order to give rise to a civil obligation which should be enforced at law. Not that the nude pact was considered to be destitute of all binding force; it gave rise to a natural obligation, and it might afford ground for a legal exception. A man of honour would keep his engagements even if he knew that the law could not be invoked to compel him to do so. Moral theology, being the science of Christian conduct, could not be satisfied with the mere legal view of the effect of an agreement. If the agreement had all other requisites for a valid contract, moral theology must necessarily consider it to be binding, even though it was a nude pact and could not be enforced in the courts of law. Canon law made this moral attitude its own. In the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX]]'' it is expressly laid down that pacts, however nude, must be kept, and that a strenuous endeavour must be made to put in execution what one has promised. It thus came to pass that nude pacts could be enforced in the Christian courts, and the Church's legislation served eventually to break down the rigid formalism of Roman law, and to prepare the way for the more equitable law of contract which all Christian nations now possess.

In the canonical and moral doctrine there is hardly room for the distinction between a nude pact, or mere agreement, and a contract. The Roman jurist's definition of the former is frequently used by canonists to define contract. They say that a contract is the consent of two or more persons to the same proposal; or, bringing out a little more definitely the effect and object of a contract, they define it to be an agreement by which two or more persons mutually bind themselves to give, do, or abstain from something. 

From the moralist's point of view, then, every agreement seriously entered into by those who are capable of contracting with reference to some lawful object is a contract, whether such agreement can be enforced in the civil courts or not. The intention of the parties is looked at, and if they seriously intended to bind themselves, there is a contractual relation between them.

==Morally-binding force of legally null contracts==
{{see also|Internal forum|Communitas Perfecta}}
This doctrine, however, gives rise to a question of some importance. The Church fully admits and defends the right of the State to make laws for the temporal well-being of its citizens. All States require certain formalities for the validity of certain actions. Last wills and testaments are a familiar example, and although they are not strictly contracts, yet the principle is the same and they will serve for an example of what is meant. A deed, the only formal contract of English law, is another example. 

A will destitute of the requisite formalities is null and void at law; but what is the effect of such a voiding law in the forum of conscience? This question has been much debated among moralists. 

Some have maintained that such a law is binding in the [[internal forum|internal]] as well as in the [[external forum]], so that a formal contract, destitute of the formalities required by law, is null and void in conscience as it is in law. 

Others adopted the contrary opinion, and held that the want of formality only affected the external forum of civil law, and left intact the natural obligation arising from a contract. 

The common opinion takes a middle course. It holds that the want of formality, though it makes the contract void in the eyes of the law, renders it only voidable in the forum of conscience; so that, until one of the parties moves to set the contract aside, it remains valid, and anyone deriving benefit under it may enjoy his benefit in peace. If, however, the party interested moves to set it aside, and does so effectively by having recourse to the court of law if necessary, both must then abide by the law which makes the contract void and of no effect.

An example of [[George Bickham the Elder|George Bickham]]'s [[Round hand|English Roundhand]] lettering and engraving ability.]]

'''Copperplate''' is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing most commonly associated with [[Round hand|English Roundhand]]. Although often used as an [[umbrella term]] for various forms of pointed pen calligraphy, Copperplate most accurately refers to script styles represented in [[Copybook (education)|copybooks]] created using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio printmaking method]].

==History==
The first use of the term "Copperplate" was in [[Ambrose Heal|Sir Ambrose Heal]]'s 1931 work ''The English Writing-Masters and Their Copy-Books 1570-1800'', although the term may have been used earlier. The term derives from the practice of engraving English roundhand onto a copper plate, also known as intaglio printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iampeth.com/lesson/business-handwriting/styles-script|title=Styles of Script|website=[[IAMPETH]]|first=Joseph|last=Vitolo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Copperplate is typically written at a 55-degree angle, and written at a slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COllDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=%22copperplate+script%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixlae3srbeAhWQ3VMKHY6FCmsQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22copperplate%20script%22&amp;f=false|title=Copperplate Calligraphy from A to Z: A Step-by-Step Workbook for Mastering Elegant, Pointed-Pen Lettering|isbn=1612438792|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolves Kill.jpg|thumb|right|320px|One wolf (right) asserting dominance over another (left) with a threat display – the teeth are bared, the ears are flattened against the body and the hackles are raised, whereas the submissive wolf lowers its head and turns away to appease the dominant individual.]]
'''Dominance in ethology''' is an "individual's preferential access to resources over another."&lt;ref&gt;Bland J. (2002) About Gender: Dominance and Male Behaviour http://www.gender.org.uk/about/10ethol/a4_mldom.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance in the context of [[biology]] and [[anthropology]] is the state of having high [[social status]] relative to one or more other individuals, who react [[submission|submissively]] to dominant individuals.  This enables the dominant individual to obtain access to resources such as food or potential mates at the expense of the submissive individual, without active aggression.  The absence or reduction of aggression means unnecessary energy expenditure and the risk of injury are reduced for both.  The opposite of dominance is [[Deference|submissiveness]].

Dominance may be a purely dyadic relationship, i.e. individual A is dominant over individual B, but this has no implications for whether either of these is dominant over a third individual C.  Alternatively, dominance may be hierarchical, with a [[transitive relation]]ship, so that if A dominates B and B dominates C, A always dominates C.  This is called a linear [[dominance hierarchy]].  Some animal societies have [[despotism|despots]], i.e. a single dominant individual with little or no hierarchical structure amongst the rest of the group. Horses use coalitions so that affiliated pairs in a herd have an accumulative dominance to displace a third horse that normally out-ranks both of them on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Blackshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23945615/Ethology-Book| title=Notes on Some Topics in Applied Animal Behaviour by Judith Blackshaw.|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and maintenance==
Dominance may initially be established by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges.  Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (competitive) behaviours with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent.  In the maintenance of dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical.  If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual.  The sub-dominant must then either escalate the intensity of the interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer.  In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.

==Functions==

The ultimate function of a dominance hierarchy is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a dominance hierarchy, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression once a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defense.

A dominant animal is one whose [[animal sexual behavior|sexual]], feeding, aggressive and other behavior patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence of the other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behavior can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J., Johnson, M., &amp; Koch, P. (1998). The nature and measurement of interpersonal dominance. (Volume 65 ed., Vol. Issue 4, pp. 308-335). Communication monograph. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcmm20.&lt;/ref&gt; For many animal societies, an individual's position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce,&lt;ref&gt;Researchers from University of Washington publish findings in ethology. (2009, August 11). Science Letter, 1136. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA205165916&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&lt;/ref&gt; however, in other animal societies, the dominance hierarchy may be unrelated to (potential) opportunities to reproduce, e.g. [[naked mole-rat]], [[bees]] and many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals. Studies have shown there is a strong association between high testosterone levels and dominance behaviors that help enhance mating success in men.&lt;ref&gt;Slatcher, R., Mehta, P., &amp; Joseph, R. (2011). Testosterone and Self-Reported Dominance Interact to Influence Human Mating Behavior. ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' 531-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hierarchical societies, dominant individuals may exert control over others.  For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with an old she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of
dominant males.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie, (1980)"&gt;MacKenzie, D. 1980. Goat Husbandry. 4th Edition. Revised and edited by Jean Laing. Faber and Faber, London and Boston. p.66-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats was not related to age or dominance.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Scott, (1947)"&gt;Stewart, J.C. and Scott, J.P. (1947). Lack of correlation between leadership and dominance relationships in a herd of goats. Journal Comparative Physiological Psychology, 40:255-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;Squires, V.R. and Daws, G.T. (1975). Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Applied Animal Ethology, 1:263-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, dominant individuals will preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to con-specifics.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Portugal, S. J. |author2=Sivess, L. | author3=Martin, G. R. |author4= Butler, P. J.|author5= White, C. R.| year=2017| title=Perch height predicts dominance rank in birds| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=456–462 | doi=10.1111/ibi.12447 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested, however, that more commonly, decision-taking about the actions of the group is dissociated from social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, T.E. (1974).  The concept of social dominance.  ''Behavioral Biology, 11'', 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The first published systematic study of dominance in animals was by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] who described in his Ph.D. dissertation of 1921, the social behaviour and priority of access to food by [[Chicken|hens]].
&lt;ref name="Schjelderup-Ebbe, (1922)"&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, T. 1922. Beitrage zurSozialpsycholgie des Haushuhns. Zeitschrift Psychologie 88: 225-252. Reprinted in Benchmark Papers in Animal Behaviour/3. Ed. M.W.Schein. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[colloquial]] term "[[pecking order]]"&lt;ref&gt;Porter G. Perrin (1955) 'Pecking Order' 1927-54 American Speech, 30(4):265-268&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hierarchical system of social organization in chickens, although it is sometimes loosely applied to other animals.

Dominance can be measured by the number of times that individuals defer to one another in social interactions, by the length of time that resources are preferentially accessed, by the number/intensity of threats given or other agonistic (competitive) behaviours.  The measurement of dominance is only applicable within the group it is measured since it is a function of the individual members of the group.

==Context dependency==
[[File:Vache herens.jpg|thumb|right|Eringer cattle competing for dominance.]]

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved.

In [[European badgers]], dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, S.E., Macdonald, D.W. and Dugdale, H.L. (2009). Context-dependent linear dominance hierarchies in social groups of European badgers, ''Meles meles''. Animal Behaviour, 77: 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominance may also vary across space in [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size,&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies may be more frequently found in captivity, since hierarchies tend to be induced by focused resources such as limited supplies of food supplied in a fixed place.

Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular.&lt;ref name="Houpt et al., (1978)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., Law, K. and Martinisi, V. (1978). Dominance hierarchies in domestic horses. Applied Animal Ethology, 4:273–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. [[Domestic pig]]lets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.  The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this [[Domestic pig#Teat order|teat order]] remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on [[Merino]]s and [[Border Leicester sheep|Border Leicesters]] revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"/&gt;

Instead, eclecticism adheres to or is constituted from several theories, styles, and ideas in order to gain a thorough insight about the subject, and draws upon different theories in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism in Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Eclecticism’ is common in many fields of study such as psychology, martial arts, philosophy,teaching,religion and drama &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Farideh|last2=Hashim|first2=Mohd Nasir|title=Eclecticism In Drama|date=2016|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eclecticism-Drama-Farideh-Alizadeh/dp/1522899103/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469894779&amp;sr=1-2}} 10.6084/m9.figshare.3511156 &amp; 10.5281/zenodo.59378.svg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches Methods ==

There are varied approaches and methods used for language teaching. In eclectic approach, the teacher can choose from these different methods and approaches:
* '''[[Grammar-translation method|Grammar-translation Method]]:''' It is a method of teaching languages by which students learn grammatical rules and then apply those rules by translating between the target language and the native language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/theteachersetofinstruments/methods-and-approaches-in-elt/grammar-translation-method https://theteachersetofinstruments]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Direct method (education)|Direct Method]]:''' In this method the teacher refrains from using the students' native language. The target language is directly used for teaching all the four skills—listening, speaking, reading and writing.
* '''Structural-situational Approach:''' In this approach, the teacher teaches language through a careful selection, gradation and presentation of vocabulary items and structures through situation based activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aslam|first1=Mohammad|title=Teaching of English|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9788175965911|page=61|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Audio-lingual method|Audio-lingual/Audio-visual Method]]:''' In this style of teaching students are taught through a system of reinforcement. Here new words and grammar are directly taught without using the students' native language. However, unlike [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], [[audio-lingual method]] does not focus on vocabulary. Instead, the teacher focuses on grammar through drill and practice.
* '''[[Bilingual method|Bilingual Method]]:''' The word 'bilingual' means the ability to speak two languages fluently. In bilingual method, the teacher teaches the language by giving mother tongue equivalents of the words or sentences. This method was developed by C.J. Dodson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dash|first1=Neena|last2=Dash|first2=M|title=Teaching English As An Additional Language|date=2007|publisher=Atlantic|isbn=9788126907793|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Communicative language teaching |Communicative Language Teaching]]:''' This approach lays emphasis on oral method of teaching. It aims to develop communicative competence in students.
* '''Total-Physical Response:''' It is based on the theory that memory is enhanced through association with physical response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onestopenglish.com/support/methodology/teaching-approaches/teaching-approaches-total-physical-response/146503.article http://www.onestopenglish.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Silent Way:''' In this method the teacher uses a combination of silence and gestures to focus students' attention. It was developed by [[Caleb Gattegno]].

==Advantages==
* The teacher has more flexibility.
* No aspect of language skill is ignored.
* There is variety in the classroom.
* Classroom atmosphere is dynamic.
*These types of programs not only negotiate teacher skill-development within an improved recognition of and respect for cross-cultural and multi-linguistic classroom settings, but also encourages student pride in their heritage, language, communication preferences and self-identity &lt;ref&gt;Crandall, J. (2003). They do speak English: World Englishes in the U.S. schools. Eric Clearing House on Languages and Linguistics, 26(3). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">'''Eco-innovation''' is the development of products and processes that contribute to [[sustainable development]], applying the commercial application of knowledge to elicit direct or indirect ecological improvements. This includes a range of related ideas, from [[environmentally friendly]] technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards [[sustainability]]. The field of research that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new "ecological" [[Idea|ideas]] and [[technology]] spread is called [[eco-innovation diffusion]].

==Concept==

The idea of eco-innovation is fairly recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-García|first=Cristina|last2=González-Moreno|first2=Ángela|last3=Sáez-Martínez|first3=Francisco J.|date=2015|title=Eco-innovation: insights from a literature review|journal=Innovation: Management, Policy &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=6–23|doi=10.1080/14479338.2015.1011060|issn=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first appearances of the concept of eco-innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James.&lt;ref&gt;Fussler, C. &amp; P. James, 1996; ''Driving Eco-Innovation: A Breakthrough Discipline for Innovation and Sustainability'', Pitman Publishing: London, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent article, Peter James defines eco-innovation as "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts".&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, P., 1997; 'The Sustainability Circle: a new tool for product development and design', ''Journal of Sustainable Product Design'' 2: 52:57, http://www.cfsd.org.uk/journal&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Rennings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|date=2000|title=Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999001123|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00112-3|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the term eco-innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.

Eco-innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with "[[environmental innovation]]", and is also often linked with [[environmental technology]], [[eco-efficiency]], [[Ecodesign|eco-design]], [[environmental design]], [[sustainable design]], or [[sustainable innovation]]. While the term "environmental innovation" is used in similar contexts to "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco-innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. [[Ecovation]] is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.

===As a technological term===

The most common usage of the term "eco-innovation" is to refer to [[innovative]] products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco-efficiency and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards [[sustainability]]. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.

===As a social process===

Another position held (for example, by the organisation [http://www.eco-innovation.net Eco Innovation]) is that this definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this "social pillar" added to James's&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though [[environmental technology]] and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., [[waste treatment]], [[recycling]], etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for [[sustainable development]].

== Diffusion ==
Literature in the field of eco-innovations often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm specific factors rather than [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]]. However, understanding of [[diffusion of eco-innovations]] recently has gained more importance given the fact that some eco-innovations are already at a mature stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakaya|first=Emrah|last2=Hidalgo|first2=Antonio|last3=Nuur|first3=Cali|date=2014|title=Diffusion of eco-innovations: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001051|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=33|issue=|pages=392–399|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.083|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of eco-innovations. At the same time, adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kowalska-Pyzalska|first=A.|date=2015|title=Social acceptance of green energy and dynamic electricity tariffs - A short review|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7477192|journal=2015 Modern Electric Power Systems (MEPS)|volume=|issue=|pages=1–7|doi=10.1109/MEPS.2015.7477192|pmid=|access-date=|via=|isbn=978-1-5090-3101-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NIMBY|"Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY)]] concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing [[intention-behavior gap]] between high levels of public support for eco-innovations and frequent non-engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renewable energy and the public: from NIMBY to participation|last=|first=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Devine-Wright|editor-first=Patrick|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyamfi|first=Samuel|last2=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first2=Susan|last3=Urmee|first3=Tania|date=2013|title=Residential peak electricity demand response—Highlights of some behavioural issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113002578|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=25|issue=|pages=71–77|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.04.006|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrka|first=Katarzyna|last2=Jȩdrzejewski|first2=Arkadiusz|last3=Sznajd-Weron|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Weron|first4=Rafał|date=2016|title=Difficulty is critical: The importance of social factors in modeling diffusion of green products and practices|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211630096X|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=62|issue=|pages=723–735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.063|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31500">'''Engineering ethics''' is the field of [[applied ethics]] and system of moral principles that apply to the practice of [[engineering]]. The field examines and sets the obligations by [[engineer]]s to [[society]], to their clients, and to the profession.  As a scholarly discipline, it is closely related to subjects such as the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of engineering]], and the [[ethics of technology]].

==Background and origins==

===The 18th century and growing concern===
[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge collapsed]] in 1879. At least sixty were killed.]]
As engineering rose as a distinct profession during the 19th century, engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises. There was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies: The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (1851), the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) (1884),&lt;ref name = "AIEE to IEEE"&gt;The AIEE merged with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) (1912) in 1963 to form the IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) (1880), and the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (AIME) (1871).&lt;ref name = "AIME"&gt;AIME is now the umbrella organization of four technical societies: the [http://www.smenet.org/ Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration] (SME) (1957), [[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS)|The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]] (TMS) (1957), the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) (1957), and the [http://www.aist.org Association For Iron and Steel Technology] (AIST) (1974). Neither AIME, nor its subsidiary societies have adopted a formal code of ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCE and AIEE were more closely identified with the engineer as learned professional, where ASME, to an extent, and AIME almost entirely, identified with the view that the engineer is a technical employee.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"&gt;Layton (1986) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, at that time ethics was viewed as a personal rather than a broad professional concern.&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standard, p. 10"&gt;ASCE (2000). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE code of ethics"&gt;{{cite web

===Turning of the  20th century and turning point===
[[File:BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston molasses disaster]] provided a strong impetus for the establishment of professional licensing and codes of ethics in the United States.]]When the 19th century drew to a close and the 20th century began, there had been series of significant [[structural failure]]s, including some spectacular [[List of bridge disasters|bridge failures]], notably the [[Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster]] (1876), [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge Disaster]] (1879), and the [[Quebec Bridge#Collapse of August 29.2C 1907|Quebec Bridge collapse]] (1907). These had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice, as well as ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASME member H.F.J. Porter had proposed as early as 1892 that the engineering societies adopt uniform membership, education, and licensing requirements as well as a code of ethics. (Layton (1986). pp. 45-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

One response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies. AIEE adopted theirs in 1912. ASCE and ASME did so in 1914.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 70 &amp; 114"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 70 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; AIME did not adopt a code of ethics in its history.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"/&gt;

Concerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures, as well as the [[Boston molasses disaster]] (1919), provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time: to require formal credentials (Professional Engineering licensure in the US) as a requirement to [[Professional Engineer|practice]]. This involves meeting some combination of educational, experience, and testing requirements.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 124-125"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|Association of German Engineers]] developed an oath for all its members titled 'The Confession of the Engineers', directly hinting at the role of engineers in the atrocities committed during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technische Intelligenz und "Kulturfaktor Technik" |editor-last=Dietz |editor-first=Burkhard |date=1996 |pages=29 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=FGfkMqguYd4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technik und Verantwortung im Nationalsozialismus |date=2004 |last=Lorenz |first=Werner |last2=Meyer |first2=Torsen |pages=55 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9ClQ9yxA7-QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vdi.de/fileadmin/media/content/hg/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decades most American states and Canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed, or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers.&lt;ref name = "Layton"&gt;Layton (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life, health, property, the public welfare and the environment to be licensed, and all provinces required licensing by the 1950s.

The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed &lt;ref&gt;https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/lawrules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in private industry.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 6-7"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics.

===Recent developments===
[[File:Citigroup center from ground.jpg|thumb|[[Citigroup Center#Engineering crisis of 1978|William LeMessurier's response]] to design deficiencies uncovered after construction of the Citigroup Center is often cited as an example of ethical conduct.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer Stamp 2000 Zoomed.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Canada Post stamp commemorating the 75th anniversary of [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]]. Issued on April 25, 2000.|{{FFDC|1=Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer Stamp 2000 Zoomed.JPG|log=2009 June 18|date=May 2012}}|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 25 June 2009|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
Efforts to promote ethical practice continue. In addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian [[Iron Ring]] and American [[Order of the Engineer]] trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.

In the United States, the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] released in 1946 its Canons of Ethics for Engineers and Rules of Professional Conduct, which evolved to the current Code of Ethics, adopted in 1964. These requests ultimately led to the creation of the Board of Ethical Review in 1954. Ethics cases rarely have easy answers, but the BER's nearly 500 advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily.&lt;ref name=BER&gt;{{cite web

Currently, bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world.&lt;ref name = "TI bribery"&gt;{{cite book | author = Transparency International and Social Accountability International |year = 2009 | title = Business Principles for Countering Bribery | url =http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/business_principles_for_countering_bribery| accessdate = 2013-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE bribery"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Report Details Guidelines to Reduce Corruption in Engineering and Construction Industry |publisher=ASCE |date=2005-06-17 |url=http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |accessdate=2006-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165346/http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new issues have arisen, such as [[offshoring]], [[sustainable development]], and environmental protection, that the profession is having to consider and address.

==General principles==
{{Rquote|right|Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public|National Society of Professional Engineers|&lt;ref name="NSPE Paramount"/&gt;}}

{{Rquote|right|A practitioner shall, regard the practitioner's duty to public welfare as paramount."|Professional Engineers Ontario|&lt;ref name="PEO public good"/&gt;}}

Codes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the [[society|public]], clients, employers, and the profession.

Many engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics. Some date to the early decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name = "Layton"/&gt; These have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions.  While these statements of general principles served as a guide, engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances.

The general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world,&lt;ref name="ICE canon"&gt;ICE (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; which further extend the code and publish specific guidance.&lt;ref name="ASCE Standards"&gt;ASCE (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]:&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"&gt;ASCE [1914] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

#Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of their professional duties.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees, and shall avoid conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall build their professional reputation on the merit of their services and shall not compete unfairly with others.
#Engineers shall act in such a manner as to uphold and enhance the honor, integrity, and dignity of the engineering profession and shall act with zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud, and corruption.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers, and shall provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;

===Obligation to society===
The paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public. As demonstrated by the following selected excerpts, this is the case for professional engineering organizations in nearly every jurisdiction and engineering discipline:

'''Responsibility of engineers'''

The engineers recognize that the greatest merit is the work and exercise their profession committed to serving society, attending to the welfare and progress of the majority.
By transforming nature for the benefit of mankind, engineers must increase their awareness of the world as the abode of humanity, their interest in the universe as a guarantee of overcoming their spirit, and knowledge of reality to make the world fairer and happier.
The engineer should reject any paper that is intended to harm the general interest, thus avoiding a situation that might be hazardous or threatening to the environment, life, health, or other rights of human beings.
It is an inescapable duty of the engineer to uphold the prestige of the profession, to ensure its proper discharge, and to maintain a professional demeanor rooted in ability, honesty, fortitude, temperance, magnanimity, modesty, honesty, and justice; with the consciousness of individual well-being subordinate to the social good.
The engineers and their employers must ensure the continuous improvement of their knowledge, particularly of their profession, disseminate their knowledge, share their experience, provide opportunities for education and training of workers, provide recognition, moral and material support to the schools where they studied, thus returning the benefits and opportunities they and their employers have received.
It is the responsibility of the engineers to carry out their work efficiently and to support the law. In particular, they must ensure compliance with the standards of worker protection as provided by the law.
As professionals, the engineers are expected to commit themselves to high standards of conduct (NSPE). [1] 11/27/11

===Whistleblowing===
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|220px| The [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] is used as a case study of whistleblowing and [[organizational behavior]] including [[groupthink]].]]
{{main article|Whistleblower}}
A basic ethical dilemma is that an engineer has the duty to report to the appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions. According to first principles, this duty overrides the duty to a client and/or employer.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, [http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html "Whistleblowing:  What Have We Learned Since the Challenger?"]&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer may be disciplined, or have their license revoked, even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health.&lt;ref&gt;See NSPE, Board of Ethical Review, Cases [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case82-5.htm 82-5] and [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case88-6.htm 88-6].&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, this duty can be discharged by advising the client of the consequences in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public.&lt;ref name="NSPE Whistleblowing"&gt;{{cite journal|author=NSPE |title=Final Report of the NSPE Task Force on Overruling Engineering Judgment to the NSPE Board of Directors |date=2006-06-30 |url=http://164.109.88.17/ethics/FINALReporttoNSPEBoard-June2006.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-20 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[whistleblowing]] by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.&lt;ref&gt;See the case of [[Shawn Carpenter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conduct===
There are several other ethical issues that engineers may face. Some have to do with technical practice, but many others have to do with broader considerations of business conduct. These include:&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standards" /&gt;
*Relationships with clients, consultants, competitors, and contractors
*Ensuring legal compliance by clients, client's contractors, and others
*[[Conflict of interest]]
*[[Bribery]] and [[kickbacks]], which also may include:
**Gifts, meals, services, and entertainment
*Treatment of [[trade secret|confidential]] or [[United States Economic and Protection of Proprietary Information Act|proprietary information]]
*Consideration of the employer’s assets
*Outside employment/activities ([[wikt:moonlight#Verb|Moonlighting]])

Some engineering societies are addressing [[environmental protection]] as a stand-alone question of ethics.&lt;ref name = "ASCE canons" /&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] often overlaps and informs ethical decision making for engineers.

==Case studies and key individuals==
Petroski notes that most engineering failures are much more involved than simple technical mis-calculations and involve the failure of the design process or management culture.&lt;ref name = "Petroski"&gt;Petroski (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all engineering failures involve ethical issues. The infamous collapse of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], and the losses of the [[Mars Polar Lander]] and [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] were technical and design process failures.

These episodes of engineering failure include ethical as well as technical issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

Fallacies are commonly divided into "formal" and "informal". A [[formal fallacy]] can be expressed neatly in a standard system of logic, such as [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]],&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"/&gt; while an [[informal fallacy]] originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form.&lt;ref name=garns&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nku.edu/~garns/165/ppt3_2.html |title = Informal Fallacies, Northern Kentucky University |date =  |accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]], but still fallacious.&lt;ref name=Downden&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Dowden |first1 = Bradley |title = Fallacy |url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/ |website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate = 17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case is a [[mathematical fallacy]], an intentionally invalid [[mathematical]] [[mathematical proof|proof]], often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious [[contradiction]]s.

==Overview==
Fallacies are defects that weaken arguments. Fallacious arguments are very common and can be persuasive in common use. They may be even "unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The new handbook of cognitive therapy techniques |last = McMullin |first = Rian E. |date = 2000 |publisher = W. W. Norton |isbn = 978-0393703139 |edition = [Rev. ed.] |location = New York |oclc = 41580357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal fallacies in particular are found frequently in mass media such as television and newspapers.&lt;ref name="McMurty1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = McMurtry |first1 = John |title = The mass media: An analysis of their system of fallacy |journal = Interchange |date = December 1990 |volume = 21 |issue = 4 |pages = 49–66 |doi = 10.1007/BF01810092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to understand what fallacies are so that one can recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies will strengthen one's ability to produce strong arguments.

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of [[soundness]] and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones.&lt;ref name="DeLancey_Handout"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = DeLancey |first1 = Craig, Ph.D. |title = Evaluating Arguments—Distinguishing between reasonable and fallacious tactics |url = https://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |website = oswego.edu |publisher = self-published |accessdate = 7 March 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130903171329/http://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |archive-date = 2013-09-03 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments."{{refn|1={{named ref|name=Damer 2009}} [https://books.google.cz/books?id=-qZabUx0FmkC&amp;pg=PA52 page&amp;nbsp;52].}} Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in [[rhetoric]]al patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the [[emotion]]al, intellectual, or [[psychology|psychological]] weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.

[[Argumentation theory]] provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In this approach, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals that attempts to resolve their disagreements. The protocol is regulated by certain rules of interaction, so violations of these rules are fallacies.

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the [[mass media]] today include but are not limited to [[propaganda]], [[advertisement]]s, [[politics]], newspaper editorials and opinion-based “news” shows.

==&lt;span id="Material fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Systems of classification==
Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book |last = Pirie |first = Madsen |authorlink = Madsen Pirie |title = How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate = 10 September 2015 |year = 2006 |publisher = A&amp;C Black |isbn = 978-0-8264-9006-3 |page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = fallacy |url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |website = Encyclopedia Brittanica |publisher = Encyclopedia Brittanica |accessdate = 13 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the definitions of the classes may not be unique. For example, [[#Whately's grouping|Whately]] treats material fallacies as a complement to logical fallacies, which makes them synonymous to informal fallacies, while others consider them to be a subclass of informal fallacies, like mentioned above.

===&lt;span id="Verbal fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] was the first to systematize logical errors into a list, as being able to refute an opponent's thesis is one way of winning an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 2 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's "[[Sophistical Refutations]]" (''De Sophisticis Elenchis'') identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types, linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some depending on language and others that do not depend on language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thenonsequitur.com/?page_id=621 |title = Aristotle's original 13 fallacies |publisher = The Non Sequitur |accessdate = 2013-05-28 |date = 2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.logiclaw.co.uk/fallacies/Straker3.html |title = Aristotle's 13 fallacies |website = www.logiclaw.co.uk |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A [[material fallacy]] is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a [[verbal fallacy]] is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905215503/http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-09-05 |title = PHIL 495: Philosophical Writing (Spring 2008), Texas A&amp;M University |date =  |accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who amongst humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 3 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A language-independent fallacy is for example:
# "[[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]] is different from Socrates."
# "Socrates is a man."
# "Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 4 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whately's grouping===

[[Richard Whately]] defines a fallacy broadly as, "any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not".&lt;ref&gt;Frans H. van Eemeren, Bart Garssen, Bert Meuffels (2009). ''Fallacies and Judgments of Reasonableness: Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules'', p.8. {{ISBN|9789048126149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whately divided fallacies into two groups: ''logical'' and ''material''. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion does follow from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's [[sophisms]] except:''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'', ''[[petitio principii]]'', and ''[[non causa pro causa]]'', which are in the material group.&lt;ref name="Coffey1912"&gt;{{cite book |first = P. |last = Coffey |year = 1912 |title = The Science of Logic |publisher = Longmans, Green, and Company |lccn = 12018756 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j8BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |page = 302 |accessdate = 2016-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other systems of classification===
Of other classifications of fallacies in general the most famous are those of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] and [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]. Bacon (''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. With these should be compared the Offendicula of Roger Bacon, contained in the Opus maius, pt. i. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book v. of his Logic, and [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Book of Fallacies (1824) contains valuable remarks. See Rd. Whateley's Logic, bk. v.; A. de Morgan, Formal Logic (1847); A. Sidgwick, Fallacies (1883) and other textbooks.

==Formal fallacy==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}

A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or ''non sequitur'' ([[Latin]] for "it does not follow") is a flaw in the structure of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[logical argument|argument]] which renders the argument [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. The flaw can neatly be expressed in standard system of logic.&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"/&gt; Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's [[premise]]s or its conclusion. Both may actually be true, or may even be more probable as a result of the argument; but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

{{Dubious span|text=By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one: for instance, an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or [[causality]] can be said to commit a formal fallacy.|date=May 2018}} "Since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments."&lt;ref name=garns /&gt;

A logical form such as "''A'' and ''B''" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a statement to be true.

The term ''logical fallacy'' is in a sense self-contradictory, because ''logic'' refers to valid reasoning, whereas a ''fallacy'' is the use of poor reasoning. Therefore, the term ''formal fallacy'' is preferred. In informal discourse however, ''logical fallacy'' is used to mean an argument which is problematic for any reason.

The term ''non sequitur'' denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one which does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies like [[affirming the consequent]].

===Common examples===
{{main|List of fallacies#Formal fallacies}}

==== Ecological fallacy ====
An [[ecological fallacy]] is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, "if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Freedman |first = David A. |title = Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods |year = 2004 |publisher = Sage |location = Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn = 978-0761923633 |pages = 293–295 |authorlink = Ecological Fallacy |editor = Michael S. Lewis-Beck &amp; Alan Bryman &amp; Tim Futing Liao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fallacy fork===
[[Maarten Boudry]] argues that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and inductive. For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation schema, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork) or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork).  To argue, for example, that one became nauseous after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy unless one were actually arguing inductively and probabilistically that it is likely that the mushroom caused the illness since some mushrooms are poisonous, it is possible to misidentify a mushroom as edible, one doesn't usually feel nauseous, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boudry |first1=Maarten |authorlink1=Maarten Boudry |title=The Fallacy Fork: Why It's Time to Get Rid of Fallacy Theory |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal fallacy==
In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates in a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument.&lt;ref name=garns /&gt; A [[deductive argument]] containing an informal fallacy may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]],&lt;ref name=Downden /&gt; but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.

Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are the "types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the ''content'' of the propositions constituting the argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Copi |first1 = Irving M. |last2 = Cohen |first2 = Carl |year = 2005 |title = Introduction to Logic |edition = 12 |publisher = Pearson Education, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-13-189834-9 }} p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty generalization ===
A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of [[faulty generalization]]s, also known as inductive fallacies. Here the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, [[statistical inference]]). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of [[empirical evidence]], however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==== Hasty generalization ====
For instance, [[hasty generalization]] is making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).
Stereotypes about people ("frat boys are drunkards", "grad students are nerdy", "women don’t enjoy sports", etc.) are a common example of the principle.

Hasty generalisation often follows a pattern such as:

:X is true for A.
:X is true for B.
:Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc.

While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.

=== Relevance fallacy ===
The [[fallacy of relevance|fallacies of relevance]] are a broad class of informal fallacies (see the [[#Fallacies of relevance|navbox below]]), generically represented by [[missing the point]]: Presenting an argument, which may be [[soundness|sound]], but fails to address the issue in question.

==== ''Argumentum ex silentio'' ====
An [[argument from silence]] features an unwarranted conclusion advanced based on the absence of data.

=== Examples of informal fallacies ===
{{Main|List of fallacies#Informal fallacies}}

==== ''Post hoc'' (false cause) ====
This fallacy gets its name from the Latin phrase "post hoc, ergo propter hoc," which translates as "after this, therefore because of this."
''Definition:'' Assuming that because B comes after A, A caused B.
Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later—for example, if I register for a class, and my name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time aren't really related as cause and event. That is, correlation isn't the same thing as causation.

==== Slippery slope ====
''Definition:'' The arguer claims that a sort of chain reaction, usually ending in some dire consequence, will take place, but in fact there is not enough evidence for that assumption.
The arguer asserts that if we take even one step onto the "[[slippery slope]]," we will end up sliding all the way to the bottom; he or she assumes we can't stop halfway down the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Logic%20and%20Analysis/most_common_logical_fallacies.htm |title = The Most Common Logical Fallacies |website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== False analogy ====
This error in reasoning occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons, hence the [[false analogy]]'s informal nickname of the "[[apples and oranges]]" fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kornprobst |first = Markus |title = Comparing Apples and Oranges? Leading and Misleading Uses of Historical Analogies |journal = Millennium&amp;nbsp;— Journal of International Studies |year = 2007 |volume = 36 |pages = 29–49 |doi = 10.1177/03058298070360010301 |url = http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094151/http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 30 October 2013 |accessdate = 29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement fallacy==
Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.
Where [[mathematical fallacies]] are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist [[Protagoras]] was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his "human-measure" principle and the practice of ''dissoi logoi'' (arguing multiple sides of an issue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Schiappa |first = Edward |title = Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric |year = 1991 |publisher = University of South Carolina Press |location = Columbia, SC |isbn = 978-0872497580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Protagoras |title = The Older Sophists |year = 1972 |publisher = Hackett Publishing Co. |location = Indianapolis, IN |isbn = 978-0872205567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by [[informal logic]] and [[argumentation theory]].

===Knowledge value measurement fallacy===
Increasing availability and circulation of [[big data]] are driving proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority,&lt;ref name=Meho&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Meho |first = Lokman I. |year = 2007 |title = The Rise and Rise of Citation Analysis |journal = [[Physics World]] |volume = January |pages = 32–36 |arxiv = physics/0701012 |bibcode = 2007physics...1012M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Metrics-of-Scholarly/5449 |title = The New Metrics of Scholarly Authority |last = Jensen |first = Michael |date = June 15, 2007 |work = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date = 28 October 2013 |publisher = The Chron |editor-last = Riley |editor-first = Michael G. |issn = 0009-5982 |oclc = 1554535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an "information tsunami".&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Baveye |first = Phillippe C. |year = 2010 |title = Sticker Shock and Looming Tsunami: The High Cost of Academic Serials in Perspective |url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/369309 |journal = [[Journal of Scholarly Publishing]] |volume = 41 |issue = 2 |pages = 191–215 |doi = 10.1353/scp.0.0074 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[anchoring]] fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge is flawed. For example, limitations of the [[journal impact factor]] (JIF) are well documented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |title = Impact Factors, Journal Quality, and Communication Journals: A Report for the Council of Communication Associations |last = National Communication Journal |publisher = National Communication Association |year = 2013 |location = Washington, D.C. |access-date = 2016-02-22 |archive-date = April 4, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160404212454/http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes, "while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative-and qualitative-indicators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gafield |first = Eugene |title = What Citations Tell us About Canadian Research |journal = Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science |year = 1993 |volume = 18 |issue = 4 |page = 34 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that arguers jettison acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments, or leave behind Garfield's "supplement rather than replace" caveat, they court commission of anchoring fallacies.

A [[naturalistic fallacy]] can occur for example in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise "more is better"&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215" /&gt; or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, "higher is better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Stein |first = Zachary |title = Myth Busting and Metric Making: Refashioning the Discourse about Development |journal = Integral Leadership Review |date = October 2008 |volume = 8 |issue = 5 |url = http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094158/http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-date = October 30, 2013 |access-date = October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[false analogy]] occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the [[Scopus]] and [[Web of Science]] bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work).&lt;ref name=Meho/&gt; Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.

For the next example let us consider Academic Analytics' [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]], which purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet the tool does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool may constitute [[argument from silence]] fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.

[[Ecological fallacy|Ecological fallacies]] can be committed when one measures scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. "Puerto Rican" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g. "Hispanic" faculty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Allen |first = Henry L. |title = Faculty Workload and Productivity: Ethnic and Gender Disparities |journal = NEA 1997 Almanac of Higher Education |year = 1997 |page = 39 |url = http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_97_04.pdf |format = PDF |access-date = October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional fallacy==

Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or for comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.

Examples of this include the speaker or writer:&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

# Diverting the argument to unrelated issues with a [[Red herring#Logical fallacy|red herring]] ([[Ignoratio elenchi]])
# Insulting someone's character ([[Ad hominem|argumentum ad hominem]])
# Assume the conclusion of an argument, a kind of circular reasoning, also called "begging the question" ([[begging the question|petitio principi]])
# Making jumps in logic ([[Non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]])
# Identifying a false cause and effect ([[post hoc ergo propter hoc]])
# Asserting that everyone agrees ([[argumentum ad populum]], [[Bandwagon effect|bandwagoning]])
# Creating a "false dilemma" ([[False dilemma|"either-or fallacy"]]) in which the situation is oversimplified
# Selectively using facts ([[Card stacking|card-stacking]])
# Making false or misleading comparisons ([[false equivalence]] and [[false analogy]])
# Generalizing quickly and sloppily ([[hasty generalization]])

In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of [[amphiboly]], for instance, to make ironic statements; [[Gary Larson]] and [[Scott Adams]] employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.&lt;ref name="How to Be Persuasive"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.rinkworks.com/persuasive/ |title = How to Be Persuasive |last = Boyer |first = Web |last2 = Stoddard |first2 = Samuel |website = Rink Works |access-date = December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment&amp;nbsp;— pragmatic theory==
According to the pragmatic theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Douglas N. |last1 = Walton |url = https://books.google.es/books?id=4uTWAAAAMAAJ |title = A Pragmatic Theory of Fallacy |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |author-link = Douglas N. Walton |year = 1995 |location = Tuscaloosa |pages = 324 |isbn = 9780817307981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fallacy can in some instances be an error a fallacy, use of a heuristic (short version of an argumentation scheme) to jump to a conclusion. However, even more worryingly, in other instances it is a tactic or ploy used inappropriately in argumentation to try to get the best of a speech part unfairly. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy&amp;nbsp;— the perpetrator and the intended victim. The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant, but also collective (shared) goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply violation of a rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation, based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contest. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation, but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labelled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence on the pragmatic approach, each case needs to analyzed individually, to determine by the textual evidence whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]] and [[demography]], the '''human [[sex ratio]]''' is the [[ratio]] of [[male]]s to [[female]]s in a [[population]]. More data is available for humans than for any other species, and the human sex ratio is more studied than that of any other species, but interpreting these statistics can be difficult.

Like most sexual species, the sex ratio in humans is approximately 1:1. Due to higher female fetal mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orzack|first=Steven Hecht|last2=Stubblefield|first2=J.

Human sex ratios, either at birth or in the population as a whole, are reported in any of four ways: the ratio of males to females, the ratio of females to males, the proportion of males, or the proportion of females. If there are 108,000 males and 100,000 females the ratio of males to females is 1.080 and the proportion of males is 51.9%. Scientific literature often uses the proportion of males. This article uses the ratio of males to females, unless specified otherwise.

== Natural ratio ==
[[File:2012 Birth Sex Ratio World Map.jpg|thumb|300px|World map of birth sex ratios, 2012]]
In a study around 2002, the natural sex ratio at birth was estimated to be close to 1.06 males/female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unexplained differences in sex ratios at birth in Europe and North America | pmc=102777 | pmid=11976243 |year=2002 |last1=Grech |first1=V |last2=Savona-Ventura |first2=C |last3=Vassallo-Agius |first3=P |volume=324 |issue=7344 |pages=1010–1 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7344.1010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that countries considered to have significant practices of prenatal sex-selection are those with birth sex ratios of 108 and above (selection against females) and 102 and below (selection against males). This assumption has been questioned by some scholars.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt;

Infant mortality is higher in boys than girls in most parts of the world. This has been explained by sex differences in genetic and biological makeup, with boys being biologically weaker and more susceptible to diseases and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Demography. 2013 Apr;50(2):421-44. {{doi|10.1007/s13524-012-0161-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have found that numerous preconception or prenatal environmental factors affect the probability of a baby being conceived male or female. It has been proposed that these environmental factors also explain sex differences in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pongou|first1=Roland|title=Why Is Infant Mortality Higher in Boys Than in Girls? A New Hypothesis Based on Preconception Environment and Evidence From a Large Sample of Twins|journal=Demography|date=14 November 2012|volume=50|issue=2|pages=421–444|doi=10.1007/s13524-012-0161-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most populations, adult males tend to have higher death rates than adult females of the same age (even after allowing for causes specific to females such as death in childbirth), both due to natural causes such as heart attacks and strokes, which account for by far the majority of deaths, and also to violent causes, such as homicide and warfare, resulting in higher [[life expectancy]] of females. For example, in the United States, as of 2006, an adult non-elderly male is 3 to 6 times more likely to become a victim of a homicide and 2.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die in an accident than a female of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/gmwk291r.htm|title=Death Rates for 113 Selected Causes by 5-Year Age Groups, Race, and Sex: the United States, 1999–2006|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the sex ratio tends to reduce as age increases and among the elderly, there is usually a greater proportion of females. For example, the male to female ratio falls from 1.05 for the group aged 15 to 65 to 0.70 for the group over 65 in [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]], from 1.00 to 0.72 in [[Demographics of the United States|the United States]], from 1.06 to 0.91 in mainland [[People's Republic of China|China]], and from 1.07 to 1.02 in India.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In the United States, the sex ratios at birth over the period 1970–2002 were 1.05 for the white non-Hispanic population, 1.04 for Mexican Americans, 1.03 for African Americans and Indians, and 1.07 for mothers of Chinese or Filipino ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matthews TJ, etal |title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States |journal=National Vital Statistics Reports |volume=53 |issue=20 |date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among Western European countries c. 2001, the ratios ranged from 1.04 in Belgium to 1.07 in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex ratio in Switzerland|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/00/01/blank/02.html | publisher=Switzerland Federal Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Sex Ratio Statistics|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm|publisher=United Nations Population Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex ratio at birth (per 100 female newborn)|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+birth&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3a52|publisher=United Nations Data Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal.  In the aggregated results of 56 Demographic and Health Surveys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.measuredhs.com/|title=The Demographic and Health Survey Program – Quality information to plan, monitor and improve population, health, and nutrition programs|publisher=measuredhs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in African countries, the ratio is 1.03, albeit with considerable country-to-country variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garenne M |title=Sex ratios at birth in African populations: a review of survey data |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=889–900 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12617497 |doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is controversy whether  sex ratios outside the 103-107 range are due to sex-selection, as suggested by some scholars, or due to natural causes. Some scholars argue that strong socioeconomic factors such as the [[dowry system in India]] and the [[one child policy]] of China are responsible for prenatal sex-selection. In a widely cited article,&lt;ref name= Sen1990&gt;Sen, Amartya (1990), More than 100 million women are missing, New York Review of Books, 20 December, pp. 61–66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amartya Sen]] supported such views. Other researchers argue that an unbalanced sex ratio should not be automatically held as evidence of prenatal sex-selection; Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), pp. 91-96&lt;/ref&gt; Angola, Botswana and Namibia have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different than the presumed "normal" sex ratio, meaning that significantly more girls have been born in such societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Garenne, Southern African Journal of Demography, Vol. 9, No. 1 (June 2004), page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In an extensive study, carried out around 2005, of sex ratio at birth in the United States from 1940 over 62 years, statistical evidence suggested the following:&lt;ref name=NCHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Trend Analysis of the Sex Ratio at Birth in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*For mothers having their first baby, the total sex ratio at birth was 1.06 overall, with some years at 1.07.
*For mothers having babies after the first, this ratio consistently decreased with each additional baby from 1.06 towards 1.03.
*The age of the mother affected the ratio:
**the overall ratio was 1.05 for mothers aged 25 to 35 at the time of birth
**mothers who were below the age of 15 or above 40 had babies with a sex ratio ranging between 0.94 and 1.11, and a total sex ratio of 1.04

== Factors affecting sex ratio in humans ==

=== Fisher's principle ===
{{Main|Fisher's principle}}

Fisher's principle is an explanation of why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1. Outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book, it is an argument in terms of parental expenditure. Essentially he argues that the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.

=== Natural factors ===
The natural factors that affect the human sex ratio are an active area of scientific research. Over 1000 articles have been published in various journals. Two of the often cited reviews of scientific studies on human sex ratio are by W. H. James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 1: A review of the literature|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 5 |pages= 721–752|pmid= 3319883|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;exprSearch=3319883&amp;indexSearch=UI&amp;lang=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= James WH|year= 1987|title= The human sex ratio. Part 2: A hypothesis and a program of research|journal= Human Biology|volume= 59|issue= 6 |pages= 873–900|pmid= 3327803|url= http://bases.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;exprSearch=3319883&amp;indexSearch=UI&amp;lang=i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific studies are based on extensive birth and death records in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. A few of these studies extend to over 100 years of yearly human sex ratio data for some countries. These studies suggest that the human sex ratio, both at birth and as a population matures, can vary significantly according to a large number of factors, such as paternal age, maternal age, plural birth, birth order, gestation weeks, race, parent's health history, and parent's psychological stress. Remarkably, the trends in human sex ratio are not consistent across countries at a given time, or over time for a given country. In economically developed countries, as well as developing countries, these scientific studies have found that the human sex ratio at birth has historically varied between 0.94 and 1.15 for natural reasons.

In a scientific paper published in 2008,&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /&gt; James states that conventional assumptions have been:
*there are equal numbers of X and Y chromosomes in mammalian sperm
*X and Y stand equal chance of achieving conception
*therefore equal number of male and female zygotes are formed, and that
*therefore any variation of sex ratio at birth is due to sex selection between conception and birth.

James cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 1.02 and 1.08. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons.

A 1999 scientific paper published by Jacobsen reported the sex ratio for 815,891 children born in Denmark between 1980–1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1999|title= Natural variation in the human sex ratio|journal= Human Reproduction|volume= 14|issue= 12 |pages= 3120–3125|doi= 10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120| pmid= 10601107|author1= Jacobsen|first1= R|last2= Møller|first2= H|last3= Mouritsen|first3= A}}&lt;/ref&gt; They studied the birth records to identify the effects of multiple birth, birth order, age of parents and the sexes of preceding siblings on the proportion of males using contingency tables, [[chi-squared test]]s and regression analysis. The secondary sex ratio decreased with increased number of children per plural birth and with paternal age, whereas no significant independent effect was observed for maternal age, birth order, or other natural factors.

A 2009 research paper published by Branum et al. reports the sex ratio derived from data in United States birth records over a 25-year period (1981–2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2009|title= Trends in US sex ratio by pluraity, gestational age and race/ethinicity |journal= Reproductive Epidemiology|volume= 24|issue= 11 |pages= 2936–2944 (see p. 2941 Figure 2)|doi= 10.1093/humrep/dep255|last1= Branum |first1= A. M. |last2= Parker |first2= J. D. |last3= Schoendorf |first3= K. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper reports that the sex ratio at birth for the white ethnic group in the United States was 1.04 when the gestational age was 33–36 weeks, but 1.15 for gestational ages of less than 28 weeks, 28–32 weeks, and 37 or more weeks. This study also found that the sex ratios at birth in the United States, between 1981–2006, were lower in both black and Hispanic ethnic groups when compared with white ethnic group.

The relationship between natural factors and human sex ratio at birth, and with aging, remains an active area of scientific research.

=== Environmental factors ===
==== Effects of climate change ====
Various scientists have examined the question whether human birth sex ratios have historically been affected by environmental stressors such as climate change and global warming. Catalano et al. report that cold weather is an environmental stressor, and women subjected to colder weather abort frail male fetuses in greater proportion thereby lowering birth sex ratios. Cold weather stressors simultaneously extend male longevity thereby raise human sex ratio in its older age bracket.&lt;ref name=Catalano /&gt; Catalano team finds that a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in annual temperature predicts one more male than expected for every 1,000 females born in a year.

Helle et al. have studied 138 years worth of human birth sex ratio data, from 1865 to 2003. They find an increased excess of male births during periods of the exogenous stress (World War II) and during warm years. In the warmest period over the 138 years, the birth sex ratio peaked at about 1.08 in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1226–1233|date=November 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01598.x|title=Evolutionary ecology of human birth sex ratio under the compound influence of climate change, famine, economic crises and wars|last1=Helle|first1=Samuli|last2=Helama|first2=Samuli|last3=Lertola|first3=Kalle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of gestation environment ====
Causes of stress during gestation, such as maternal malnutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson R, Bergström S |title=Is maternal malnutrition associated with a low sex ratio at birth? |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1101–6 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9825599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generally appear to increase fetal deaths particularly among males,&lt;ref name=Catalano&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catalano R, Bruckner T, Smith KR |title=Ambient temperature predicts sex ratios and male longevity |journal=Proc.

Also, higher incidence of [[Hepatitis B]] virus in populations is believed to increase the male to female sex ratio, while some unexplained environmental health hazards are thought to have the opposite effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis DL, Gottlieb MB, Stampnitzky JR |title=Reduced ratio of male to female births in several industrial countries: a sentinel health indicator? |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=13 |pages=1018–23 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9533502|doi=10.1001/jama.279.13.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of gestational environment on human sex ratio are complicated and unclear, with numerous conflicting reports. For example, Oster et al. examined a data set of 67,000 births in China, 15 percent of whom were Hepatitis B carriers. They found no effect on birth sex ratio from Hepatitis B presence in either the mothers or fathers.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;{{cite web | last=Oster | first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Oster | last2=Chen | first2=Gang | last3=Yu | first3=Xinsen | last4=Lin | first4=Wenyao | title=Hepatitis B Does Not Explain Male-Biased Sex Ratios in China | year=2008 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/hbvnotecon.pdf | accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effects of chemical pollution ====
A 2007 survey by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program noted abnormally low sex ratios &lt;!-- in which direction? --&gt; in Russian Arctic villages and [[Inuit]] villages in [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]], and attributed this imbalance to high levels of [[endocrine disruptor]]s in the blood of inhabitants, including [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[DDT]]. These chemicals are believed to have accumulated in the tissues of fish and animals that make up the bulk of these populations' diets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/gender/story/0,,2167005,00.html Man-made chemicals blamed many more girls than boys are born in Arctic], The Guardian, 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted in the [[#Social factors|Social factors]] section below, it is important to exclude alternative explanations, including social ones, when examining large human populations whose composition by ethnicity and race may be changing.

A 2008 report provides further evidence of effects of [[xenoestrogens|feminizing chemicals]] on male development in each class of [[vertebrate]] species as a worldwide phenomenon, possibly leading to a decline in the sex ratio in humans and a possible decline in [[sperm]] counts.&lt;ref name=indepen /&gt; Out of over 100,000 recently introduced chemicals, 99% are poorly regulated.&lt;ref name=indepen&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/its-official-men-really-are-the-weaker-sex-1055688.html | title=It's official: Men really are the weaker sex | work=[[The Independent]] | author=Lean, Geoffrey  | date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other factors that could possibly affect the sex ratio include:
* Social status of the mother, known to be a factor in influencing the sex ratio of certain animals such as swine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendl M, Zanella AJ, Broom DM, Whittemore CT |title=Maternal social status and birth sex ratio in domestic pigs: an analysis of mechanisms |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1361–70 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80051-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently not in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellis L, Bonin S |title=Social status and the secondary sex ratio: new evidence on a lingering controversy |journal=Soc Biol |volume=49 |issue=1–2 |pages=35–43 |year=2002 |pmid=14652908 |doi=10.1080/19485565.2002.9989047}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the mother smokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mills JL, England L, Granath F, Cnattingius S |title=Cigarette smoking and the male-female sex ratio |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=1243–5 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12738529 |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(03)00156-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the mother has a partner or other support network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Norberg, Karen |title=Partnership Status and the Human Sex Ratio at Birth |series=NBER Working Paper Series |id=w10920 |date=November 2004 |ssrn=622634}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this correlation is widely considered{{by whom|date=January 2013}} to be the result of an unknown third factor.
*[[Latitude]], with countries near the equator producing more females than near the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Navara KJ |title=Humans at tropical latitudes produce more females |journal=Biol. Lett. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=524–7 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19364717 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0069|pmc=2781905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientific studies suggest that environmental effects on human sex ratio at birth are either limited or not properly understood. For example, a research paper published in 1999, by scientists from Finland’s National Public Health Institute, reports the effect of environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio over 250 years in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1999|title= Environmental chemicals and changes in sex ratio: analysis over 250 years in finland|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives|volume= 107|issue= 10 |pages= 813–815|pmid= 10504147 |pmc= 1566625 | doi= 10.1289/ehp.99107813|author1= Vartiainen|first1= T|last2= Kartovaara|first2= L|last3= Tuomisto|first3= J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific team evaluated whether Finnish long-term data are compatible with the hypothesis that the decrease in the ratio of male to female births in industrial countries is caused by environmental factors. They analyzed the sex ratio of births from the files of Statistics Finland and all live births in Finland from 1751 to 1997. They found an increase in the proportion of males from 1751 to 1920; this was followed by a decrease and interrupted by peaks in births of males during and after World War I and World War II. None of the natural factors such as paternal age, maternal age, age difference of parents, birth order could explain the time trends. The scientists found that the peak ratio of male proportion precedes the period of industrialization or the introduction of pesticides or hormonal drugs, rendering a causal association between environmental chemicals and human sex ratio at birth unlikely. Moreover, these scientists claim that the trends they found in Finland are similar to those observed in other countries with worse pollution and much greater pesticide use.

Some studies have found that certain kinds of environmental [[pollution]], in particular [[dioxin]]s leads to higher rates of female births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Check|first=Erika|date=2005-10-21|title=Pollution makes for more girls|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051017/full/news051017-16.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news051017-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/pollution-debate-born-of-chemical-valleys-girl-baby-boom/article18253243/|title=Pollution debate born of Chemical Valley's girl-baby boom|last=Mittelstaedt|first=Martin|date=2005-11-15|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-08-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pollutants such as PCBs can cause an increase in the male ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2008/07/just-little-bit-history-repeating-pollution-and-sex-ratio|title=Just a little bit of history repeating: Pollution and sex ratio|work=EWG|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social factors ===
[[Sex-selective abortion]] and [[infanticide]] are thought to significantly skew the naturally occurring ratio in some populations, such as China, where the introduction of ultrasound scans in the late 1980s has led to a birth sex ratio (males to females) of 1.181 (2010 official census data for China).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/16/c_131052436.htm China's sex ratio declines for two straight years] Xinhua, China (16 August 2011) – "Li Bin, director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, made the remarks at a press conference (...). China's sex ratio at birth was 118.08 males for every 100 females in 2010, according to census data, Li said."&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 India census reports India's sex ratio in 0–6 age bracket at 1.088.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census2011.co.in/p/glance.php India at Glance – Population Census 2011 – Final] Census of India, Government of India (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 birth sex ratios for China and India are significantly above the mean ratio recorded in the United States from 1940 through 2002 (1.051); however, their birth sex ratios are within the 0.98–1.14 range observed in the United States for significant ethnic groups over the same time period.&lt;ref name=NCHS /&gt;{{rp|10}} Along with Asian countries, a number of European, Middle East, and Latin American countries have recently reported high birth sex ratios in the 1.06 to 1.14 range. High birth sex ratios, some claim, may be caused in part by social factors.

Reported sex ratios at birth, outside the typical range of 1.03 to 1.07, thus call for an explanation of some kind.

Another hypothesis has been inspired by the recent and persistent high birth sex ratios observed in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]—both predominantly Orthodox Christian societies—and [[Azerbaijan]], a predominantly Muslim society. Since their independence from Soviet Union, the birth sex ratio in these Caucasus countries has risen sharply to between 1.11 and 1.20, some of world's highest. Mesle et al. consider the hypothesis that the high birth sex ratio may be because of the social trend of more than two children per family, and birth order possibly affects the sex ratio in this region of the world. They also consider the hypothesis that sons are preferred in these countries of the Caucasus, the spread of scans and there being a practice of sex-selective abortion; however, the scientists admit that they do not have definitive proof that sex-selective abortion is actually happening or that there are no natural reasons for the persistently high birth sex ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sharp Increase in Sex Ratio at Birth in the Caucasus. Why? How?|author1=Mesle, France |author2=Vallin, Jacques |author3=Badurashvili, Irina |year=2007|pages=73–89|isbn=2-910053-29-6|publisher=Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/pdf/BOOK_singapore.pdf#page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of how the social composition of a human population may produce unusual changes in sex ratios, in a study in several counties of California where declining sex ratios had been observed, Smith and Von Behren observe "In the raw data, the male birth proportion is indeed declining. However, during this period, there were also shifts in demographics that influence the sex ratio. Controlling for birth order, parents' age, and race/ethnicity, different trends emerged. White births (which account for over 80%) continued to show a statistically significant decline, while other racial groups showed non-statistically significant declines (Japanese, Native American, other), little or no change (black), or an increase (Chinese). Finally, when the white births were divided into Hispanic and non-Hispanic (possible since 1982), it was found that both white subgroups suggest an increase in male births."  They concluded, "that the decline in male births in California is largely attributable to changes in demographics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith D, Von Behren J |title=Trends in the sex ratio of California births, 1960–1996 |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16286492 |pmc=1732975 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early marriage and parents' age ====
Several studies have examined human birth sex ratio data to determine if there is a natural relationship between the age of mother or father to the birth sex ratio. For example, Ruder has studied 1.67 million births in 33 states in the United States to discern effect of parent's age and birth sex ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Paternal-Age and Birth-Order Effect on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio|author=Ruder, Avima |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=37|pages=362–372|year=1985f|pmc=1684568|pmid=3985011|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jacobsen et al. have studied 0.82 million births in Denmark with the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Variation in the Human Sex Ratio|author=Jacobsen|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=14|issue=12|pages=3120–3125|year=1999|doi=10.1093/humrep/14.12.3120|pmid=10601107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists find that maternal age has no statistically significant role on human birth sex ratio. However, they report a significant effect of paternal age. Significantly more male babies were born per 1000 female babies to younger fathers than to older fathers. These studies suggest that social factors such as [[Child marriage|early marriage]] and quickly fertile couples may play a role in raising birth sex ratios in certain societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Studies in The Human Sex Ratio 5.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data sources and data quality issues ====
Reported sex ratios at birth for some human populations may be influenced not only by cultural preferences and social practices that favor the birth or survival of one sex over the other but also by incomplete or inaccurate reporting or recording of the births or the survival of infants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Even what constitutes a [[live birth (human)|live birth]] or [[infant mortality|infant death]] may vary from one population to another. For example, for most of the 20th century in Russia (and the [[Soviet Union]]), extremely premature newborns (less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 1000&amp;nbsp;grams in weight, or less than 35 centimeters in length) were not counted as a live birth until they had survived 7 days; and if that infant died in those first 168 hours it would not be counted as an infant death. This led to serious underreporting of the [[Infant mortality rate]] (by 22% to 25%) relative to standards recommended by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Barbara A. |first2=Brian D. |last2=Silver |title=Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union: Regional Differences and Measurement Issues |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=705–37 |year=1986 |doi=10.2307/1973432 |jstor=1973432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When unusual sex ratios at birth (or any other age) are observed, it is important to consider misreporting, misrecording, or under registration of births or deaths as possible reasons. Some researchers have in part attributed the high male to female sex ratios reported in [[mainland China]] in the last 25 years to the underreporting of the births of female children after the implementation of the [[one-child policy]], though alternative explanations are now generally more widely accepted, including above all the use of ultrasound technology and [[sex-selective abortion]] of female fetuses and, probably to a more limited degree, neglect or in some cases [[infanticide]] of females. In the case of China, because of deficiencies in the [[vital signs|vital statistics]] registration system, studies of sex ratios at birth have relied either on special fertility surveys, whose accuracy depends on full reporting of births and survival of both male and female infants, or on the national [[population census]] from which both birth rates and death rates are calculated from the household's reporting of births and deaths in the 18 months preceding the census.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the number of births reported to family planning and other administrative agencies has been significantly lower than the number determined in population surveys and the census. See Zhang, Guangyu (April 2004) [http://paa2004.princeton.edu/papers/40283 "Very Low Fertility in China in the 1990s: Reality or An Illusion Arising from Birth Underreporting?"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that this underreporting of births or deaths is sex-selective, both fertility surveys and censuses may inaccurately reflect the actual sex ratios at birth.&lt;ref&gt;For studies reveal underreporting or delayed reporting of female births in China, see {{cite journal |vauthors=Merli MG, Raftery AE |title=Are births underreported in rural China?

=== Economic factors ===
Catalano has examined the hypothesis that population stress induced by a declining economy reduces the human sex ratio. He compared the sex ratio in East and West Germany for the years 1946 to 1999, with genetically similar populations. The population stressors theory predicts that the East German sex ratio should have been lower in 1991 when East Germany's economy collapsed than expected from its previous years. Furthermore, the theory suggests that East German birth sex ratios should generally be lower than the observed sex ratio in West Germany for the same years, over time. According to Catalano's study, the birth sex ratio data from East Germany and West Germany over 45 years support the hypothesis. The sex ratio in East Germany was also at its lowest in 1991. According to Catalano study, assuming women in East Germany did not opt to abort male more than female, the best hypothesis is that a collapsing economy lowers the human birth sex ratio, while a booming economy raises the birth sex ratio. Catalano notes that these trends may be related to the observed trend of elevated incidences of very low birth weight from maternal stress, during certain macroeconomic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex ratios in the two Germanies: a test of the economic stress hypothesis|author=Catalano, Ralph |journal=Human Reproduction| volume=18|issue=9|pages=1972–1975|year=2003|doi=10.1093/humrep/deg370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other gestational factors ===
A research group led by Ein-Mor reported that sex ratio does not seem to change significantly with either maternal or paternal age. Neither [[gravidity]] nor [[parity (medicine)|parity]] seem to affect the male-to-female ratio.&lt;ref name=Ein-Mor /&gt; However, there is a significant association of sex ratio with the length of gestation.&lt;ref name=Ein-Mor&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ein-Mor E, Mankuta D, Hochner-Celnikier D, Hurwitz A, Haimov-Kochman R |title=Sex ratio is remarkably constant |journal=Fertil.

For example, James suggested&lt;ref name=James-FertilSterilJournal&gt;{{cite journal |author=James W.H.|title=The Inconstancy of Human Sex Ratios at Birth |journal=Fertil.

In another study, James has offered the hypothesis that human sex ratios, and mammalian sex ratios in general, are causally related to the hormone levels of both parents at the time of conception.&lt;ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology&gt;{{cite journal|author=James W.H.|title=Hypothesis:Evidence that Mammalian Sex Ratios at birth are partially controlled by parental hormonal levels around the time of conception|journal=Journal of Endocrinology|volume=198|pages=3–15|date=July 2008|doi= 10.1677/JOE-07-0446|issue=1|pmid=18577567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is yet to be tested and proven true or false over large population sets.

[[File:Pyramide Bahrein.PNG|thumb|Gender imbalance in [[Bahrain]] caused by policies that restrict female spouses and children of immigrant workers]]

==Gender imbalance==

Gender imbalance is a disparity between males and females in a population. As stated above, males usually exceed females at birth but subsequently experience different mortality rates due to many possible causes such as differential natural death rates, war casualties, and deliberate gender control.

According to Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, two Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters for the ''[[New York Times]]'', violence against women is causing gender imbalances in many developing countries.&lt;ref name="Kristof"&gt;Kristof, Nicholas and Sheryl WuDunn. ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunities for Women Worldwide.'' Knopf, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They detail sex-selective [[infanticide]] in the developing world, particularly in China, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt;

Commonly, countries with gender imbalances have three characteristics in common. The first is a rapid decline in fertility, either because of preference for smaller families or to comply with their nation's population control measures. Second, there is pressure for women to give birth to sons, often because of cultural preferences for male heirs. Third, families have widespread access to technology to selectively abort female fetuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Man: One Chinese Bachelor's Search for Love|date=15 November 2011|author1=Jian Lee, Deborah  |author2=Subramanian, Sushma 
|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-gao-po-bachelor-women-marriage-economy|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a contributing measure to gender imbalance in developing countries, Kristof and WuDunn's&lt;ref name=Kristof /&gt; best estimate is that a girl in India, from 1 to 5 years of age, dies from discrimination every four minutes (132,000 deaths per year); that 39,000 girls in China die annually, within the first year of life, because parents did not give girls the same medical care and attention that boys received. The authors describe similar gender discrimination and gendercide in Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, Iraq, Bahrain, Thailand and many other developing countries.

Some of the factors suggested as causes of the gender imbalance are [[war]]fare (excess of females, notably in the wake of [[World War I casualties|WWI]] in western Europe, and [[World War II casualties|WWII]], particularly in [[Demographics of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]); [[Sex-selective abortion|sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] (excess of males, notably in [[Demographics of China|China]] as a result of the [[one-child policy]], or in [[Demographics of India|India]]); and large-scale migration, such as that by male labourers unable to bring their families with them (as in [[Qatar]] and other Gulf countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://qz.com/335183/heres-why-men-on-earth-outnumber-women-by-60-million/|title = A story of drinkers, genocide and unborn girls|last = Bauer|first = David|date = January 2015|publisher = Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Gender imbalance may result in the threat of social unrest, especially in the case of an excess of low-status young males unable to find spouses,&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerie M. Hudson|Hudson, Valerie M.]] and den Boer, Andrea M. (2004) ''Bare Branches: The Security Implications of Asia's Surplus Male Population''. The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0262582643}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and being recruited into the service of militaristic political factions. [[Economic]] factors such as male-majority industries and activities like the [[petrochemical]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[military]], and [[technology]] also have created a male gender imbalance in some areas dependent on one of these industries. Conversely, the [[entertainment]], [[banking]], [[tourism]], [[fashion]], and [[Customer service|service]] industries may have resulted in a female-majority gender imbalance in some areas dependent on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/03/30/a_singles_map_of_the_united_states_of_america/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A singles map of the United States of America | first=Richard | last=Florida | date=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Michael |last1=Kvasnicka |first2=Dirk |last2=Bethmann |title=World War II, Missing Men, and out-of-wedlock childbearing |id=07-30 |publisher=The Institute of Economic Research, Korea University |date=1 October 2007 |url=http://econ.korea.ac.kr/~ri/WorkingPapers/W0730.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the male-to-female sex ratio in the German state of Bavaria fell as low as 0.60 after the end of [[World War II]] for the most severely affected age cohort (those between 21 and 23 years old in 1946). This same study found that out-of-wedlock births spiked from approximately 10–15% during the inter-war years up to 22% at the end of the war. This increase in out-of-wedlock births was attributed to a change in the marriage market caused by the decline in the sex ratio.

[[File:Pyramide Estonie.PNG|thumb|left|Gender imbalance in [[Estonia]]]]The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.01 males/female, with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book" /&gt;

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a gender ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 (Saudi Arabia 1.13, Arab Emirates 2.73, Qatar 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[guest workers]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} Conversely, countries of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

In the [[evolutionary biology]] of [[sexual reproduction]], the [[operational sex ratio]] (OSR), is the ratio of sexually competing males that are ready to mate to sexually competing females that are ready to mate,&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. | title = Sexual Selection in Males and Females | doi = 10.1126/science.1133311 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1882–1885 | year = 2007 | pmid =  18096798| pmc = | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1882C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kvarnemo1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kvarnemo, C. |author2=Ahnesjo, I. | year = 1996 | title = The dynamics of operational sex ratios and competition for mates | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 404–408  | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(96)10056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emlen1976"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emlen, S.T. | year = 1976 | title = Lek organization and mating strategies in the bullfrog | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–313 |doi=10.1007/bf00300069 | jstor=4599103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively the local ratio of fertilizable females to sexually active males at any given time.&lt;ref name="Emlen1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Emlen, S.T. |author2=Oring, L.W. | year = 1977| title = Ecology, Sexual Selection, and the Evolution of Mating Systems | journal = Science | volume = 197 | issue = 4300 | pages = 215–223 | pmid=327542 | doi=10.1126/science.327542|bibcode=1977Sci...197..215E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its difference from the physical [[sex ratio]], is that it does not take into account sexually inactive or non-competitive individuals (individuals that do not compete for mates). On occasion, regions with a high male-low female sex ratio, like Alaska, have shown a correlation with a higher rate of reported rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/17/opinion/sutter-alaska-ratio-rape/index.html|title=Opinion: Nope, not too many men in Alaska - CNN|first=By John D. Sutter,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences of a high sex ratio ==
There are several social consequences of an imbalanced sex ratio. High ratios of males make it easier for women to marry, but harder for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Louis, Henry | year = 1975 | title = Schema d'Evolution des Marriages apres de Grandes Variations des Naissances | url = http://www.persee.fr/doc/pop_0032-4663_1975_num_30_4_18620| journal = Population | volume = 30 | issue = 759| page = 779 |doi=10.2307/1530481|jstor=1530481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of China and India, there is a 12–15% excess of young men. These men will remain single and will be unable to have families, in societies where marriage is regarded as virtually universal and social status and acceptance depend, in large part, on being married and creating a new family. Analyses of how sex ratio imbalances affect personal consumption and intra-household distribution were pioneered by [[Gary Becker]], [[Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1981 | title = The Impact of the Female Marriage Squeeze and the Contraceptive Revolution on Sex Roles and the Women's Liberation Movement in the United States, 1960 to 1975 | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 49–65 | doi=10.2307/351416| jstor = 351416 | last1 = Heer | first1 = David M. | last2 = Grossbard-Shechtman | first2 = Amyra }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Grossbard-Shechtman (1993), ''On the Economics of Marriage – A Theory of Marriage, Labor and Divorce''.

Beverly Hills: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; High ratios of males have a positive effect on marital fertility and women's share of household consumption and negative effects on non-marital cohabitation and fertility and women's labor supply. It has been shown that variation in sex ratio over time is inversely related to married women's labor supply in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Grossbard-Shechtman, Shoshana and Granger, Clive W. (September 1998). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4805034_Women's_Jobs_and_Marriage_--_Baby-Boom_Versus_Baby-Bust "Women’s Jobs and Marriage, Baby-Boom versus Baby-Bust,"] ''Population'', 53: 731–52 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = Marriage Markets and Women's Labor Force Participation | url = | journal = Review of Economics of the Household | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 249–278 | doi=10.1007/s11150-007-9014-1| last1 = Amuedo-Dorantes | first1 = Catalina | last2 = Grossbard | first2 = Shoshana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional problem is that many of these men are of low socioeconomic class with limited education. When there is a shortage of women in the marriage market, the women can "marry up", inevitably leaving the least desirable men with no marriage prospects. In many communities today, there are growing numbers of young men who come from lower classes who are marginalized because of lack of family prospects and the fact that they have little outlet for sexual energy. There is evidence that this situation will lead to increased levels of antisocial behavior and violence and will ultimately present a threat to the stability and security of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The sex ratio and male-on-female intimate partner violence |journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=4|pages=555|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.04.026|year=2010|last1=d'Alessio|first1=Stewart J.|last2=Stolzenberg|first2=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypertexts may take a variety of forms including [[imitation]], [[parody]], and [[pastiche]].

The word was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows: "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the ''hypertext'') to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the [[hypotext]]), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly ".&lt;ref name="Herman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree (review)|year=1998|publisher=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|pages=1043–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this technical use of the word in semiotics differs from its use to mean a link in the field of , although the two are related. Liestøl's study of Genette's narratological model and [[hyperfiction]] considers how they are related and suggests that hyperfiction narratives have four levels:&lt;ref name="Liestol1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liestøl|first=Gunnar|chapter=Wittgenstein, Genette, and the Reader's Narrative in Hypertext|title=

Various methods in immunochemistry have been developed and refined, and been used in scientific study, from [[virology]] to [[molecular evolution]].

One of the earliest examples of immunochemistry is the [[Wasserman test]] to detect [[Syphilis]]. [[Svante Arrhenius]] was also one of the pioneers in the field; he published ''Immunochemistry'' in 1907 which described the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of [[toxin]]s and [[antitoxins]].

Immunochemistry is also studied from the aspect of using [[antibodies]] to label [[epitopes]] of interest in cells ([[immunocytochemistry]]) or tissues ([[immunohistochemistry]])

It is applied to conservation of [[agricultural biodiversity]] in [[agro ecosystem]]s by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming practices.


==Methods==
About 4% of the total geographical area of the country is used for ''in situ'' conservation. The following methods are presently used for ''in situ'' conservation.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! In-situ conservation !! Number available
|-
| Biosphere reserves || 18
|-
| National parks || 104
|-

|-
|}

===Biosphere reserve===
Biosphere reserves cover very large areas, often more than 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are used to protect species for a long time. Currently, there are 18 Biosphere Reserves in India.

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. Currently, there are 103 national parks in India.

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
According to Conservation international, to qualify as a hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria :
 
• it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world's total) as endemics,

• it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved.
It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks.
India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

===Community reserves===
It is the type of protected area introduced in Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002 to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

===Sacred groves===
They are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

==Benefits==
One benefit of ''in situ'' conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, [[ex-situ conservation]] may be used on some or all of the population, when ''in situ'' conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation is mostly based on nothing. This involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Also, sufficiently large reserves are maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary [[genetic diversity]] to survive within the population, so that it has a good chance of continuing to [[Adaptation (biology)|adapt]] and [[evolution|evolve]] over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In [[agriculture]], ''in situ conservation'' techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers' experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a [[germplasm]] bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;G. Avila, L. Guzmán, M. Céspedes 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Integrated human studies''' is an emerging educational field that equips people with [[knowledge]] and competencies across a range of disciplines to enable them to address the challenges facing [[Human|human beings]] this century. It differs from other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] educational initiatives in that its [[curriculum]] is purpose designed rather than simply an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of existing disciplines.

[[Kyoto University]] in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soujin/index_e.php Kyoto University] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Western Australia]] established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008. This center brings together the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|arts and humanities]] to focus on the nature and future of humankind. Its fundamental concern is to promote human well-being at an individual, local and global level within a sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.uwa.edu.au Integrated Human Studies, University of Western Australia] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of disciplinary fields has arisen as a response to the “increasing [[Specialization of knowledge|specialization]] of [university] courses to meet the demands of [[Technological change|technological progress]], [[economic growth]] and [[Vocational education|vocational training]]”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Neville. [http://u08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/237/index_html Abstract for World Universities Forum] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the development of ever narrower fields of study at tertiary level. Proponents of integrated human studies believe that a broader, interdisciplinary approach is needed to enable future [[Decision-making|decision-makers]] to grasp the complexities of the issues facing humankind in the [[21st century]] and craft workable solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14733">The '''Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO''' ('''IOC/UNESCO''') was established by resolution 2.31 adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]]. It first met in Paris at Unesco Headquarters from 19 to 27 October 1961. Initially, 40 States became members of the Commission. The IOC assists governments to address their individual and collective ocean and coastal management needs, through the sharing of knowledge, information and technology as well as through the co-ordination of programs and building capacity in ocean and coastal research, observations and services.

The IOC is the only UN body specialized in ocean science and services. It provides a focus for other UN organizations and agencies with regard to ocean science, observations and data exchange, and services such as global [[tsunami warning system]]s. Established in 1960, the Commission celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 and currently has 147 Member States. Since the IOC often has its own accreditation within meetings such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), this gives UNESCO two seats and two voices at the table.

The IOC has been a key player in the recent international debate on sustainable development as it relates to the ocean. The Rio+20 outcome document affirmed the importance of “the ocean and coasts” to the sustainability debate, and is the basis for IOC’s ongoing support to the creation of a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to the ocean. The IOC is closely involved in several international partnerships for ocean sustainability such as with the CBD, UN-Oceans and the World Ocean Assessment.

The IOC/UNESCO is composed of its Member States (147 in 2014), an Assembly, an Executive Council and a Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Paris, France. Additionally the IOC has a number of Subsidiary Bodies: three regional sub-commissions (IOCARIBE, IOCAFRICA, and WESTPAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icriforum.org/about-icri/members-networks/intergovernmental-oceanographic-commission-unesco-ioc-unesco|title=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) {{!}} International Coral Reef Initiative|website=www.icriforum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and programme and project offices in Apia (Samoa), Bangkok (Thailand), Cartagena (Colombia), Copenhagen (Denmark), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kingston (Jamaica), Nairobi (Kenya), Muscat (Oman), Perth (Australia), and Port-au-Prince (Haiti). The JCOMM in situ Observations Programme Support Centre, currently hosted in Toulouse (France), is in the process of moving to Brest (France). Additionally, IOC has a strong presence in Oostende (Belgium), where the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) and the Secretariat for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) are based. Under IOC mandate, the IODE coordinates since 1961 the exchange of information and data between the IOC Member States and its national oceanographic data centers. As for OBIS, it was established by the [[Census of Marine Life]] program (www.coml.org), and developed between 2000 and 2010 as an evolving strategic alliance of people and organizations sharing a vision to make marine biogeographic data, from all over the world, freely available over the World Wide Web. Any organization, consortium, project or individual may contribute data to OBIS.

== IOC High Level Objectives (2014-2021)==

# '''Healthy ocean ecosystems and sustained [[ecosystem services]]'''

The IOC is working to improve responses to unprecedented environmental changes and to promote ocean health via marine sciences. The IOC supports the UN World Ocean Assessment, the UNGA-led regular process for reviewing the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. Integrating existing information from different disciplines on the state of the ocean will improve policy responses from national governments and the international community. The IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) are also successful examples of multilateral efforts for ocean monitoring, observation, and services. GOOS coordinates the deployment of observation technologies, rapid and universal dissemination of data flows, and delivery of marine information to managers, decision makers, and the general public. JCOMM is an intergovernmental body of technical experts drawn from the meteorological and oceanographic communities to provide observing capabilities, data management, and services.

# '''Effective early warning systems and preparedness for tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards'''

The IOC aids and advises policy makers and managers in the reduction of risks from [[tsunami]]s, [[storm surge]]s, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) and other [[coastal hazards]]. After close to fifty years of experience coordinating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS), IOC-UNESCO is leading a global effort to establish ocean-based tsunami warning systems as part of an overall multi-hazard disaster reduction strategy. The IOC Tsunami Unit works with Member States, together with other UN agencies and NGOs, to build sustainable tsunami early warning systems. In this context, the IOC coordinates and fosters the establishment of regional intergovernmental tsunami warning and mitigation systems in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, in the Caribbean, and in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected seas. Through its Intergovernmental Panel on Harmful Algae (IPHAB), the IOC also works to establish systems that can predict the occurrences and mitigate the effects of HAB events.

# '''Increased resiliency to climate change and variability and enhanced safety, efficiency and effectiveness of ocean-based activities through scientifically-founded services, adaptation and mitigation strategies'''

The IOC works with developed and developing countries to monitor and document changes in order to aid in the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through GOOS, the IOC monitors the physical, chemical and biological aspects and changes in the world’s ocean. This unified network permits the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies and provides information and data for governments, industry, scientists and the general public. The IOC is also actively pushing to convince decision makers of the importance of sound scientific knowledge in designing policy on integrated coastal management, HABs,  and ocean acidification (through blue carbon research and initiatives). Ocean acidification is of particular concern to the IOC, as increasing CO2 levels in the ocean are associated with coral bleaching, changes in marine biodiversity, and other related problems.

# '''Enhanced knowledge of emerging ocean science issues'''

The IOC actively assists Member States in the design and implementation of new Marine Spatial Planning tools, both at the political and managerial levels, for [[ecosystem-based management]] of marine and coastal areas. Through its International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange programme (IODE), the IOC facilitates the exploitation, development, and exchange of oceanographic data and information among participating Member States. IODE seeks, in particular, to train marine information specialists from developing countries. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) manages the global marine biodiversity knowledge base, through which hundreds of institutions and scientists contribute information on the past and current diversity, abundance and distribution of marine life. OBIS data is used worldwide for planning ocean conservation policies, and identifying biodiversity hotspots and distribution trends. It allows the IOC to provide expertise, data and information for environmental, climate change, and marine biodiversity assessments.

== IOC Contributions to UNESCO's Global Priorities ==

* '''GENDER'''

The IOC is committed to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in ocean science. Through the Network of Women in Ocean Science (NOW in Ocean Science), the IOC hopes to mobilize women marine scientists to work with IOC to create a space for exchange of experience and opportunities for young women willing to start a career in marine science.

* '''AFRICA'''

The IOC has established a Sub-Commission for Africa and adjacent islands to reinforce the implementation of IOC programmes in Africa and mobilize extra-budgetary resources. The IOC Regional Office, established within the UNESCO Office in Nairobi, Kenya, became operational in 2012 and has formulated IOC's strategic plan for the region.

== IOC &amp; Capacity Development ==

The IOC seeks to empower developing countries through fund-raising, team building, and decision-making skills development to sustainably use their coastal and marine resources by encouraging ‘self-driven’ capacity-development. This approach aims to reduce dependence on aid while creating incentives for states to more fully integrate scientific know-how into policy design and implementation processes.

* '''Transfer of Marine Technology'''

The IOC of UNESCO is recognized in the UN-wide system for its traditional competencies in the field of Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). On the occasion of its first session in 20012, the IOC’s Advisory Body of Experts on the Law of the Sea (IOC/ABE-LOS), an IOC subsidiary body whose function is to provide advice on the IOC’s role in relation to UNCLOS upon the request from the IOC governing bodies, accepted the challenge of drawing the Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology (CGTMT), following the instructions set forth in Article 271 of UNCLOS:
''States, directly or through competent international organizations, shall promote the establishment of generally accepted guidelines, criteria and standards for the transfer of marine technology on a bilateral basis or within the framework of international organizations and other fore, taking into account, in particular, the interests and needs of developing States''

In the CGTMT, marine technology refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. In this sense, marine technology may include any of the following components:

a)Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services&lt;br /&gt;
b)Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials&lt;br /&gt;
c)Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples)&lt;br /&gt;
d)Observation facilities and equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation)&lt;br /&gt;
e)Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation&lt;br /&gt;
f)Computer and computer software, including models and modeling techniques&lt;br /&gt;
g)Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation

Transfer of Marine Technology (TMT) should enable all parties concerned to benefit on an equitable basis from developments in marine science related activities, in particular, those aiming at stimulating the social and economic contexts in developing States.

* '''Flagship initiative: OceanTeacher Global Academy'''
{{update section|date=July 2018}}
OceanTeacher (OT) has been developed as a training system for ocean data managers (working in ocean data centres), marine information managers (marine librarians) as well as for marine researchers who wish to acquire knowledge on data and/or information for planning and management. Since 2005, more than a thousand students from over a hundred countries attended courses at the IOC Project Office for IODE, based in Oostende, Belgium, and in the context of regional projects. The “Global Academy” component of OT (OTGA) is still being developed, but it seeks to expand the program into a worldwide training facility, with training courses related to multiple IOC fields (from ICAM to Tsunami Alert Systems) in various Regional Training Centers (RTCs), all of them connected in real time via the OceanTeacher Learning Management System, and using a multilingual approach to scientific training (English, Spanish, and other national languages, depending on the regional and national context). OTGA will change training from a “north to south” culture to a north-south, south-south, and south-north model by promoting the expertise available in developing countries. This new "OceanTeacher Global Academy" concept will be implemented during 2014. OTGA will be broadcasting from and to anywhere across the world.

'''Language pedagogy'''{{definition needed|date=March 2017}} may take place as a general school subject, in a specialized [[language school]], or out of school with a rich selection of [[Language pedagogy#Proprietary methods|proprietary methods]] online and in books, CDs and DVDs. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

There are '''three principal views''':
# The '''structural''' view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The '''functional''' view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The '''interactive''' view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This view has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |authorlink= |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-00843-3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In the late 1800s and most of the 1900s,&lt;ref name=Anthony1963 /&gt; language teaching was usually conceived in terms of ''method''. In seeking to improve teaching practices, teachers and researchers would typically try to find out which method was the most effective.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=57}} However, ''method'' is an ambiguous concept in language teaching, and has been used in many different ways. According to Bell, this variety in use "offers a challenge for anyone wishing to enter into the analysis or deconstruction of methods".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2003|p=326}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'' ==

In 1963, University of Michigan Linguistics Professor Edward Mason Anthony Jr. formulated a framework to describe various language teaching methods, which consisted of three levels: ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}} According to Anthony, "The arrangement is hierarchical. The organizational key is that techniques carry out a method which is consistent with an approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|1963|pp=63–67}}, cited in {{Harvnb|Richards|Rogers|2001|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''approach'' was of a set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning which would be consistent over time; "an approach is axiomatic".&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; His ''method'' was more procedural; "an overall plan for the orderly presentation of language material, no part of which contradicts, and all of which is based upon, the selected approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; Finally, his concept of ''technique'' referred to the actual implementation in the language classroom; "a particular trick, stratagem, or contrivance used to accomplish an immediate objective."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; He saw techniques as being consistent with a given method and by extension, with a given approach.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}}

A method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned and should be based upon a selected approach.  In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students and the roles of teachers. A technique is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective.  Such are derived from the controlling method, and less-directly, with the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Anthony's framework was welcomed by the language teaching community when it was introduced, and it was seen as a useful way of classifying different teaching practices.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} However, it did not clearly define the difference between ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique'', and Kumaravadivelu reports that due to this ambiguity there was "widespread dissatisfaction" with it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} Anthony himself recognized the limitations of his framework, and was open to the idea of improvements being made to it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}}

Richards and Rogers' 1982 approach expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, instead of ''approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'', they chose the terms ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their concept of ''approach'' was similar to Anthony's, but their ''design'' and ''procedure'' were of broader scope than Anthony's ''method'' and ''technique''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their ''design'' referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, types of activities to be used in the classroom, and student and teacher roles; ''procedure'' referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework,{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=86}} and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different "methods".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}} This evaluation process was a key way that their formulation differed from Anthony's, as Anthony's framework was intended as purely descriptive.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}}

Despite Richards and Rogers' efforts to clearly define ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure'', their framework has been criticized by Kumaravadivelu for having "an element of artificiality in its conception and an element of subjectivity in its operation".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Kumaravadivelu also points to similar objections raised by Pennyworth and by the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning''.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Brown also questions the suitability of Richards and Rogers' term ''design''; he points out that in English teaching ''design'' is usually used to refer specifically to curriculum design, rather than the broad definition Richards and Rogers used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most current teacher training manuals favor the terms ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=77}}

== Structural methods ==

=== Grammar–translation method ===
{{main article|Grammar–translation method}}
The grammar translation method instructs students in [[grammar]], and provides [[vocabulary]] with direct translations to [[memory|memorize]]. It was the predominant method in Europe in the 19th century. Most instructors now acknowledge that this method is ineffective by itself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} It is now most commonly used in the traditional instruction of the [[classical languages]], however it remains the most commonly practiced method of English teaching in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At school, the teaching of grammar consists of a process of training in the rules of a language which must make it possible for all the students to correctly express their opinion, to understand the remarks which are addressed to them and to analyze the texts which they read.
The objective is that by the time they leave college, the pupil controls the tools of the language which are the vocabulary, grammar and the [[orthography]], to be able to read, understand and write texts in various contexts. The teaching of grammar examines texts, and develops awareness that language constitutes a system which can be analyzed.
This knowledge is acquired gradually, by traversing the facts of language and the syntactic mechanisms, going from simplest to the most complex. The exercises according to the program of the course must untiringly be practiced to allow the assimilation of the rules stated in the course.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} That supposes that the teacher corrects the exercises. The pupil can follow his progress in practicing the language by comparing his results.
Thus can he adapt the grammatical rules and control little by little the internal logic of the syntactic system. The grammatical analysis of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s constitutes the objective of the teaching of grammar at the school. Its practice makes it possible to recognize a [[text (literary theory)|text]] as a coherent whole and conditions the training of a foreign language.
Grammatical terminology serves this objective.  Grammar makes it possible for each pupil to understand how his mother tongue functions, in order to give him the capacity to communicate his thought.

=== Audio-lingual method ===
{{Main article|Audio-lingual method}}
The audio-lingual method was developed in the United States around [[World War II]] when governments realized that they needed more people who could conduct conversations fluently in a variety of languages, work as interpreters, code-room assistants, and translators. However, since foreign language instruction in that country was heavily focused on reading instruction, no textbooks, other materials or courses existed at the time, so new methods and materials had to be devised. For example, the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program created intensive programs based on the techniques [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and other linguists devised for Native American languages, where students interacted intensively with native speakers and a linguist in guided conversations designed to decode its basic grammar and learn the vocabulary. This "[[Informant (linguistics)|informant method]]" had great success with its small class sizes and motivated learners.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The U.S. Army Specialized Training Program only lasted a few years, but it gained a lot of attention from the popular press and the academic community.  [[Charles C. Fries]] set up the first English Language Institute at the [[University of Michigan]], to train English as a second or foreign language teachers.  Similar programs were created later at [[Georgetown University]], [[University of Texas]] among others based on the methods and techniques used by the military.  The developing method had much in common with the British oral approach although the two developed independently. The main difference was the developing audio-lingual methods allegiance to structural linguistics, focusing on grammar and contrastive analysis to find differences between the student's native language and the target language in order to prepare specific materials to address potential problems. These materials strongly emphasized drill as a way to avoid or eliminate these problems.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

This first version of the method was originally called the oral method, the aural-oral method or the structural approach. The audio-lingual method truly began to take shape near the end of the 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the [[space race]].  Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from [[behaviorist psychology]] to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the [[Second language|target language]] at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The typical structure of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and there was even a text book entitled '''ALM''' [1963]) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was "pattern practice," which were drills expecting "automatic" responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as "mimicry-memorization." 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue.  6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.

Due to weaknesses in performance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm Universiteit Antwerpen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112010049/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm |date=2009-01-12 }} James L. Barker lecture on November 8, 2001 at [[Brigham Young University]], given by Wilfried Decoo.&lt;/ref&gt; and more importantly because of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theoretical attack on language learning as a set of habits, audio-lingual methods are rarely the primary method of instruction today. However, elements of the method still survive in many textbooks.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

== Functional methods ==

=== The oral approach and situational language teaching ===
The oral approach was developed from the 1930s to the 1960s by British applied linguists such as Harold Palmer and A.S. Hornsby.  They were familiar with the direct method as well as the work of 19th-century applied linguists such as Otto Jespersen and Daniel Jones but attempted to formally develop a more scientifically founded approach to teaching English than was evidenced by the direct method.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A number of large-scale investigations about language learning and the increased emphasis on reading skills in the 1920s led to the notion of "vocabulary control". It was discovered that languages have a core basic vocabulary of about 2,000 words that occur frequently in written texts, and it was assumed that mastery of these would greatly aid reading comprehension. Parallel to this was the notion of "grammar control", emphasizing the sentence patterns most-commonly found in spoken conversation. Such patterns were incorporated into dictionaries and handbooks for students. The principal difference between the oral approach and the direct method was that methods devised under this approach would have theoretical principles guiding the selection of content, gradation of difficulty of exercises and the presentation of such material and exercises. The main proposed benefit was that such theoretically based organization of content would result in a less-confusing sequence of learning events with better contextualization of the vocabulary and grammatical patterns presented.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Last but not least, all language points were to be presented in "situations".  Emphasis on this point led to the approach's second name. Proponents claim that this approach leads to students' acquiring good habits to be repeated in their corresponding situations. These teaching methods stress PPP:  presentation (introduction of new material in context), practice (a controlled practice phase) and production (activities designed for less-controlled practice).&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Although this approach is all but unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on language teaching, being the basis of many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks as late as the 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Many of the structural elements of this approach were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative language teaching. However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

=== Directed practice ===
Directed practice has students repeat phrases. This method is used by U.S. diplomatic courses. It can quickly provide a phrasebook-type knowledge of the language. Within these limits, the student's usage is accurate and precise. However the student's choice of what to say is not flexible.

== Interactive methods ==

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school (North America)|High School]] Spanish taught as a [[second language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an American [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

=== Direct method ===
{{Main article|Direct method (education)}}
The direct method, sometimes also called ''natural method'', is a method that refrains from using the learners' native language and just uses the target language. It was established in Germany and France around 1900 and is best represented by the methods devised by Berlitz and de Sauzé, although neither claims originality and it has been re-invented under other names.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |authorlink= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0883771144 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct method operates on the idea that second language learning must be an imitation of [[first language]] learning, as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of oral skills at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

According to this method, printed language and text must be kept away from second language learners for as long as possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words until he has good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after the printed word has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency.

The method relies on a step-by-step progression based on question-and-answer sessions which begin with naming common objects such as doors, pencils, floors, etc. It provides a motivating start as the learner begins using a foreign language almost immediately. Lessons progress to verb forms and other grammatical structures with the goal of learning about thirty new words per lesson.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== The series method ===
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}

In the 19th century, [[François Gouin]] went to [[Hamburg]] to learn [[German language|German]]. Based on his experience as a [[Latin]] teacher, he thought the best way to do this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, when he went to the academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

When he returned home, he found that his three-year-old nephew had learned to speak French. He noticed the boy was very curious and upon his first visit to a mill, he wanted to see everything and be told the name of everything.  After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but a way of thinking and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

The series method is a variety of the direct method in that experiences are directly connected to the target language. Gouin felt that such direct "translation" of experience into words, makes for a "living language". (p59) Gouin also noticed that children organize concepts in succession of time, relating a sequence of concepts in the same order. Gouin suggested that students learn a language more quickly and retain it better if it is presented through a chronological sequence of events. Students learn sentences based on an action such as leaving a house in the order in which such would be performed. Gouin found that if the series of sentences are shuffled, their memorization becomes nearly impossible. For this, Gouin preceded psycholinguistic theory of the 20th century. He found that people will memorize events in a logical sequence, even if they are not presented in that order. He also discovered a second insight into memory called "incubation". Linguistic concepts take time to settle in the memory. The learner must use the new concepts frequently after presentation, either by thinking or by speaking, in order to master them. His last crucial observation was that language was learned in sentences with the verb as the most crucial component. Gouin would write a series in two columns: one with the complete sentences and the other with only the verb. With only the verb elements visible, he would have students recite the sequence of actions in full sentences of no more than twenty-five sentences. Another exercise involved having the teacher solicit a sequence of sentences by basically ask him/her what s/he would do next. While Gouin believed that language was rule-governed, he did not believe it should be explicitly taught.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

His course was organized on elements of human society and the natural world. He estimated that a language could be learned with 800 to 900 hours of instruction over a series of 4000 exercises and no homework. The idea was that each of the exercises would force the student to think about the vocabulary in terms of its relationship with the natural world. While there is evidence that the method can work extremely well, it has some serious flaws. One of which is the teaching of subjective language, where the students must make judgments about what is experienced in the world (e.g. "bad" and "good") as such do not relate easily to one single common experience. However, the real weakness is that the method is entirely based on one experience of a three-year-old. Gouin did not observe the child's earlier language development such as naming (where only nouns are learned) or the role that stories have in human language development. What distinguishes the series method from the direct method is that vocabulary must be learned by translation from the native language, at least in the beginning.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== Communicative language teaching ===
{{main article|Communicative language teaching}}
Communicative language teaching (CLT), also known as ''the Communicative Approach'', emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonvanhattum.com.br/comreth.html van Hattum, Ton (2006), The Communicative Approach Rethought]&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be popular, particularly in Europe, where [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] views on language learning and education in general dominate academic discourse. Although the 'Communicative Language Teaching' is not so much a method on its own as it is an approach.

In recent years, [[task-based language learning]] (TBLL), also known as task-based language teaching (TBLT) or task-based instruction (TBI), has grown steadily in popularity. TBLL is a further refinement of the CLT approach, emphasizing the successful completion of tasks as both the organizing feature and the basis for assessment of language instruction. Dogme language teaching shares a philosophy with TBL, although differs in approach.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Meddings, L and Thornbury, S (2009) Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching. Peaslake: Delta.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogme is a communicative approach, and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Meddings |last=Luke |title=Throw away your textbooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/26/tefl.lukemeddings |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate = 22 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language immersion ===
{{Main article|Language immersion}}
Language immersion in school contexts delivers academic content through the medium of a foreign language, providing support for L2 learning and first language maintenance.  There are three main types of immersion education programs in the United States: foreign language immersion, dual immersion, and indigenous immersion.

Foreign language immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English. In the early immersion model, for all or part of the school day elementary school children receive their content (academic) instruction through the medium of another language: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  In early total immersion models, children receive all the regular kindergarten and first grade content through the medium of the immersion language;&lt;ref name="Kho, Mu-Jeong 2016"&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016). How to Implant a Semiotic and Mathematical DNA into Learning English, Seoul: Booklab Publishing Co. {{ISBN|979-11-87300-04-5}} (53740), 261 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; English reading is introduced later, often in the second grade. Most content (math, science, social studies, art, music) continues to be taught through the immersion language. In early partial immersion models, part of the school day (usually 50%) delivers content through the immersion language, and part delivers it through English.  French-language immersion programs are common in Canada in the provincial school systems, as part of the drive towards [[bilingualism]] and are increasing in number in the United States in public school systems (Curtain &amp; Dahlbert, 2004). Branaman &amp; Rhodes (1998) report that between 1987 and 1997 the percentage of elementary programs offering foreign language education in the U.S. through immersion grew from 2% to 8% and Curtain &amp; Dahlberg (2004) report 278 foreign language immersion programs in 29 states. Research by Swain and others (Genesee 1987) demonstrate much higher levels of proficiency achieved by children in foreign language immersion programs than in traditional foreign language education elementary school models.

Dual immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English as well as for students whose home language is the immersion language (usually Spanish).  The goal is bilingual students with mastery of both English and the immersion language. As in partial foreign language immersion academic content is delivered through the medium of the immersion language for part of the school day, and through English the rest of the school day.

Indigenous immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for American Indian communities desiring to maintain the use of the native language by delivering elementary school content through the medium of that language. Hawaiian Immersion programs are the largest and most successful in this category.

=== Silent Way ===
{{main article|Silent Way}}
The Silent Way is a discovery learning approach, invented by [[Caleb Gattegno]] in the late 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space for the students to explore the language.  Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think.  The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way is a good example of the [[Articulatory approach for teaching pronunciation|Articulatory Approach]].

=== Community language learning ===
{{main article|Community language learning}}
The ''community language learning'' (CLL) is a method proposed by [[Charles A. Curran]] during the 1970s. It is based on the counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates [[translation]] and recording techniques.

=== Suggestopedia ===
{{main article|Suggestopedia}}
Suggestopedia was a method that experienced popularity especially in past years, with both staunch supporters and very strong critics, some claiming it is based on [[pseudoscience]].

=== Natural approach ===
{{main article|Natural approach}}
The natural approach is a language teaching method developed by [[Stephen Krashen]] and [[Tracy D. Terrell]]. They emphasise the learner receiving large amounts of [[comprehensible input]]. The Natural Approach can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Total physical response ===
{{main article|Total physical response}}
In total physical response (TPR), the instructor gives the students commands in the target language and the students act those commands out using whole-body responses. This can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling ===
{{main article|Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling}}
Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPR Storytelling or TPRS) was developed by Blaine Ray, a language teacher in California, in the 1990s. At first it was an offshoot of [[Total Physical Response]] that also included storytelling, but it has evolved into a method in its own right and has gained a large following among teachers, particularly in the United States. TPR Storytelling can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

===Dogme language teaching===
{{Main article|Dogme language teaching}}
Dogme language teaching is considered to be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to language teaching and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.

=== Growing Participator Approach ===
The [[Growing Participator Approach]] (GPA) is an alternative way of thinking about second language acquisition, developed by [https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/ Greg Thomson]. GPA as an approach is usually implemented using Thomson's Six Phase Program (SPP) method, which involves 1,500 hours of special growth participation activities, supported by a local native language speaker, and targeted towards the learners growth zone ([[Zone of proximal development]]). The Six Phase Program utilises a number of techniques, such as TPR, to quickly grow the leaners comprehension ability without the use of English. The goal is to help learners continually 'grow' in their ability to meaningful 'participate' in the host culture. GPA influences include [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as well as "the psycholinguistics of comprehension and production, usage-based approaches to language, linguistic anthropology and discourse analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/|title=Growing Participator Approach to a host world (An Alternative to "Second Language Acquisition")|website=growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Proprietary methods==
Some methods are tied to a particular company or school, and are not used in mainstream teaching. Besides those mentioned below, there are dozens of competitors, each slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lang1234.com/ |title=Find better language courses: Impartial reviews of 70 self-study programs|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable are the computer courses which use speech recognition to give feedback on pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/3/category/scored/1.html/ |title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pimsleur method===
Pimsleur language learning system is based on the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher [[Paul Pimsleur]]. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.

===Michel Thomas Method===
{{Main article|Michel Thomas Method}}
Michel Thomas Method is an audio-based teaching system developed by Michel Thomas, a language teacher in the USA. It was originally done in person, although since his death it is done via recorded lessons. The instruction is done entirely in the student's own language, although the student's responses are always expected to be in the target language. The method focuses on constructing long sentences with correct grammar and building student confidence. There is no listening practice, and there is no reading or writing. The syllabus is ordered around the easiest and most useful features of the language, and as such is different for each language.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Thomas: The Learning Revolution, by Jonathan Solity.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''line shaft''' is a power driven rotating shaft for [[power transmission]] that was used extensively from the [[Industrial Revolution]] until the early 20th century. Prior to the widespread use of [[electric motor]]s small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute [[power (physics)|power]] from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex.  The central power source could be a [[water wheel]], turbine, windmill, animal power or a [[steam engine]].  Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s, [[pulley]]s and gears known as ''millwork''.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

The fixed pulley on the upper shaft is driven at constant speed by a belt from the power source. The loose pulley ('idler') allows the machine to be stopped in isolation – necessary for changing speed. The stepped pulleys (left) provide three drive speeds for the machine tool (not shown), depending on which pair of pulleys is connected by the belt.]]

A typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area. One [[pulley]] on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building. The other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts. In manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks, the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated. In other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements, the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes. Shafts were usually horizontal and overhead but occasionally were vertical and could be underground. Shafts were usually rigid steel, made up of several parts bolted together at flanges. The shafts were suspended by hangers with bearings at certain intervals of length. The distance depended on the weight of the shaft and the number of pulleys. The shafts had to be kept aligned or the stress would overheat the bearings and could break the shaft. The bearings were usually [[Friction bearing|friction]] type and had to be kept lubricated. Pulley lubricator employees were required in order to ensure that the bearings did not freeze or malfunction.

In the earliest applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating mostly from the 18th century. Flat [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or [[cotton duck]] impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning to keep them in good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.

Pulleys were constructed of wood, iron, steel or a combination thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys could be used to give a variety of speed settings for the machine.

Occasionally gears were used between shafts to change speed rather than belts and different sized pulleys, but this seems to have been relatively uncommon.

==History==
Early versions of line shafts date back into the 18th century, but they were in widespread use in the late 19th century with industrialization.  Line shafts were widely used in manufacturing, woodworking shops, machine shops, saw mills and [[Gristmill|grist mills]].

In 1828 in Lowell, Massachusetts, [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] substituted leather belting for metal gearing to transfer power from the main shaft running from a water wheel. This innovation quickly spread in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Flat belt drive systems became popular in the UK from the 1870s, with the firms of [[J &amp; E Wood]] and [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons]] prominent in their introduction. Both of these firms manufactured stationary steam engines and the continuing demand for more power and reliability could be met not merely by improved engine technology but also improved methods of transferring power from the engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. The use of flat belts was already common in the US but rare in Britain until this time. The advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, and it was a more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.&lt;ref name="Hills208"&gt;[[#Hills|Hills]] pp.208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century some factories had a mile or more of line shafts in a single building.

In order to provide power for small shops and light industry, specially constructed "power buildings" were constructed.  Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through line shafts to all the leased rooms.  Power buildings continued to be built in the early days of electrification, still using line shafts but driven by an electric motor.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

As some factories grew too large and complex to be powered by a single steam engine, a system of "sub divided" power came into use.  This was also important when a wide range of speed control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron.  Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed.  However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones.  The [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts.  Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"&gt;

With factory [[electrification]] in the early 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive line shafting and millwork.  After 1900 smaller industrial motors became available and most new installations used individual electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn= |pages=14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam turbine powered line shafts were commonly used to drive [[paper machine]]s for speed control reasons until economical methods for precision electric motor speed control became available in the 1980s; since then many have been replaced with sectional electric drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}} (Article has photo of line shaft and turbine.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Economical variable speed control using electric motors was made possible by [[silicon controlled rectifier]]s (SCRs) to produce direct current and variable frequency drives using [[Power inverter|inverters]] to change DC back to AC at the frequency required for the desired speed.

Most systems were out of service by the mid-20th century and relatively few remain in the 21st century, even fewer in their original location and configuration.

==Disadvantages and alternatives==

===Disadvantages===
Compared to individual electric motor or ''unit'' drive, line shafts have the following disadvantages: &lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;
*Power loss with line shafts varied widely and was typically 25% and often much higher; however, using [[Rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]] and good quality lubrication could minimize losses.  Roller and spherical bearings gained acceptance in the decade before electrification of factories began.
*Continuous noise  
*Maintenance costs were higher.
*The systems were more dangerous.
*Down time due to mechanical problems was higher.
*It was not as easy to change speed.
*Factory layout was designed around access to the line shafts, not in the most efficient manner for the work flow.
*The line shafts and millwork took up a lot of space; Baldwin Locomotive Works estimated 40% more than electric drive.
*The shafts and belting were in the way of lighting, overhead cranes and ventilation ducts.  
*Alignment of the system was critical and problematic for long shafts that were subject to expansion and contraction, settling and vibration.
*The belting shed dust and kept it continuously circulating in the air.
*Oil dripped from the overhead shafting.

Firms switching to electric power showed significantly less employee sick time, and, using the same equipment, showed significant increases in production.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“We can scarcely step into a shop or factory of any description without encountering a mass of belts which seem at first to monopolize every nook in the building and leave little or no room for anything else”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historical alternatives to line shafts===
To overcome the distance and friction limitations of line shafts, wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than line shafts and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers.  They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than line shafts, and had one-tenth the initial cost.

To supply small scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed.  Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe.  The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel production

There were also some central stations providing pneumatic power in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">The '''Mierscheid law''' is {{Citation needed span|text=a satirical forecast|date=September 2011}} [[hypothesis]], published in the German magazine ''[[Vorwärts]]'' on 14 July 1983 and attributed to the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]]. It forecasts the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD)'s share of the [[Direct election|popular vote]] based on the size of crude steel production in Western Germany:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |title=19 Jahre Mierscheid-Gesetz – ein ungerades Jubiläum und die Aussichten der SPD bei der Bundestagswahl (19 Years of the Mierscheid Law   an odd numbered anniversary and the chances of the SPD in the national parliamentary elections) |accessdate=2007-05-26 |author=Jakob Mierscheid, Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages |authorlink=Jakob Maria Mierscheid |date=2002-03-20 |format=pdf |publisher=German Parliament,  Platz der Republik, 11011 Berlin |language=German |quote=Die Formulierung des Mierscheid-Gesetzes selber lautet: "Der Stimmenanteil der SPD richtet sich nach dem Index der deutschen Rohstahlproduktion – gemessen in Mio. Tonnen – im jeweiligen Jahr der Bundestagswahl." (The formulation of the Mierscheid Law is as follows: The proportion of votes for the SPD depends on the index of German crude steel production measured in millions of metric tons in the corresponding year.) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707200224/http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Vote share of the SPD equals the Index of the crude steel production in the western federal states – measured in millions of tonnes – in the year of the federal election.}}

There is a special rule for early elections. One then has to take the arithmetic mean of the regular and early year of election.

The last corroboration of the law was in the 2002 election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,362874,00.html | title = Warum die SPD die Wahl gewinnt (Why the SPD will win the election) | accessdate = 2007-01-11
| author = Yassin Musharbash| date = 2005-06-29| work = Spiegel Online| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the West German crude steel production was 38.6 million tonnes, and the vote share of the SPD 38.5%. For the early election in 2005 the vote share was 38.4%, with a mean crude steel value of 40.0 million tonnes.  Over the last ten elections, the two values were within two units nine times, and within one unit seven times.

==Possible refutation of the hypothesis in 2005==

In the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal elections]] of 18 September 2005 (which were originally due to be held in 2006), the law appeared not to hold, since the SPD obtained 34.3% of the relevant votes while the crude steel production of the "old" ''Länder'' (i.e. those states that belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification) in the previous year was 39.9 million [[tonnes]].

However, an article attributed to Jakob Mierscheid, published on the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament's]] website provided a correction to the hypothesis, to take account of the special situation. Since the elections had been brought forward, it was argued that the last months of the year should be discounted, yielding a steel production figure of 33.5 million tonnes. The graph included in the article showed a good match, thus supporting the (corrected) hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| title = Vorläufige Hypothese zum Mierscheid-Gesetz (Preliminary hypothesis on the Mierscheid Law)| accessdate = 2007-01-11| author = The legendary Jakob Mierscheid, MdB| authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid| date = 2005-12-13| format = pdf| work = | publisher = Official Web site of the German Bundestag| language = German| quote = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012233/http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| archivedate = 2008-09-11| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis alteration might be considered an example of the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]].

Following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 elections]], an article was published by the statistical office of the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] attempting to further refine the model in the form of the Mierscheid-Walla law. This article also mentions promising but inconclusive attempts to replace steel production with other measures that exhibited a degree of apparent [[correlation]], such as the export value of automobiles, employment levels in the field of legal advice, the price of coffee, and the number of accidents on town roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | title = Das Mierscheid-Walla-Gesetz (The Mierscheid-Walla Law) | accessdate = 2007-01-11 | author = Jakob Maria Mierscheid (the legend) | authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid | author2 = Wolfgang Walla | date = March 2006 | format = pdf | work = Statistisches Monatsheft Baden-Württemberg 3/2006 | publisher = Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (Statistical offices of the German federal government and the states) | language = German | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012231/http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rousseau theRepastOfTheLion.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Henri Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Repast of the Lion]]'' (circa 1907), is an example of naïve art.]]

'''Naïve art''' is any form of [[visual art]] that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, [[art history]], technique, [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ways of seeing).&lt;ref name="Roberto"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Roberto |editor-first=K.

One particularly influential painter of "naïve art" was [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), a French [[Post-Impressionist]] who was discovered by [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Characteristics==
Naïve art&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaïa ''L'Art naïf'' éd. Parkstone International {{ISBN|9781859956687}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as [[outsider art]] that is by someone without formal (or little) training or degree.  While this was true before the twentieth century, there are now [[Art school|academies]] for naïve art. Naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre, represented in art galleries worldwide.

The characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting, especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective (such as defined by the ''Progressive Painters of the Renaissance''):
# Decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance,
# Muting of colors with distance,
# Decrease of the precision of details with distance,
The results are:
# Effects of perspective geometrically erroneous (awkward aspect of the works, children's drawings look, or medieval painting look, but the comparison stops there)
#  Strong use of pattern, unrefined color on all the plans of the composition, without enfeeblement in the background,
# An equal accuracy brought to details, including those of the background which should be shaded off.
Simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art. It has, however, become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called ''pseudo-naïve''.

Whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive  formal education in an [[art school]] or [[academy]], for example [[Henri Rousseau]] or [[Alfred Wallis]], 'pseudo naïve' or 'faux naïve' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original.

Strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists, given the expansion of [[Autodidactism]] as a form of education in modern times. Naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Amy|title=Lure of the Naïve|url=http://amygellerillustration.com/assets/thesis.pdf|website=amygellerillustration.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2016|ref=page 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[translation|first1=[text] Natalia Brodskaia ;|last2=Darton]|first2=adaptation Mike|title=Naïve art|date=2000|publisher=Parkstone Press|location=New York|isbn=1859953352|page=74|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Schools-Movements-Natalia-Brodskaya/dp/1859953352|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known. Museums devoted to naïve art now exist in  [[Kecskemét]], [[Hungary]]; [[Riga, Latvia]]; [[Jaen, Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasil]]; [[Musée d’art naïf de Vicq en Île-de-France|Vicq]] [[France]] and [[Paris]].

"Primitive art" is another term often applied to art by those without formal training, but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically "primitive" by Western academia, such as Native American, subsaharan African or Pacific Island art (see [[Tribal art]]). This is distinguished from the self-conscious, "primitive" inspired movement [[primitivism (art)|primitivism]]. Another term related to (but not completely synonymous with) naïve art is [[folk art]].

There also exist the terms "naïvism" and "[[primitivism]]" which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art (like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/article2_engl.htm Irina Arnoldova. Painter Sergey Zagraevsky: the view of an art critic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements ==
Nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene, as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the "Modern Classic", naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity. At all events, naive art can be regarded as having occupied an "official" position in the annals of twentieth-century art since - at the very latest - the publication of the ''Der Blaue Reiter'', an almanac in 1912. Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, who brought out the almanac, presented 6 reproductions of paintings by ''le Douanier' Rousseau (Henri Rousseau)'', comparing them with other pictorial examples. However, most experts agree that the year that naive art was "discovered" was 1885, when the painter Paul Signac became aware of the talents of Henri Rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/Articles/Martens/naive_intro.html|title=WetCanvas: Articles: Jan and Adrie Martens: An Introduction to Naive Art|website=www.wetcanvas.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Group ===
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hlebine School ===
A term applied to Croatian naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. At this time, according to the World Encyclopedia of Naive Art (1984), the village amounted to little more than ‘a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses’, but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with Yugoslav naive painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hlebine School - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095939383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlebine]] is a small picturesque municipality in the North of Croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting. This was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet [[Antun Gustav Matoš]] and the biggest name in Croatian literature, [[Miroslav Krleža]], who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from Western influences. These ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from Hlebine – [[Krsto Hegedušić]] and he went on to found the Hlebine School of Art in 1930 in search of national “rural artistic expression”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/hlebine-school-of-art-more-than-peasant-doodles/|title=Hlebine School of Art: More than peasant doodles|website=MoonProject|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Generalić]] was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmnu.org/en/vodic.asp|title=The Croatian Museum of Naive Art - Guide to the Permanent Display|last=Otvorena.hr|first=Otvorena mreza -|website=www.hmnu.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić.

The Hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 Venice Biennale and exhibitions in Brazil and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QujBgAAQBAJ|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Croatia|date=2015-04-07|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465441737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].

[[File:Muscles anterior labeled.png|thumb|Muscles anterior labeled]]
As originally proposed by Enoka,&lt;ref name="Neuromechanical Basis of Kinesiology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Enoka|first=Roger|title=Neuromechanical Basis of Kinesiology|year=1988|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0873221796}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''neuromechanics''' is a field of study that combines concepts from biomechanics and neurophysiology to study human movement.  Neuromechanics examines the combined roles of the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems and how they interact to produce the motion required to complete a motor task.&lt;ref name="Neuromechanics definition" /&gt;

Muscles signals stimulated by neurological impulses are collected using [[electromyography]] (EMG).  These muscle signals are indicative of neural activity.  In certain instances, EMG data can be indicative of [[neuroplasticity]] and learning of motor tasks.&lt;ref name="Neuroplasticity and EMG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byl|first=NN|title=Focal hand dystonia may result from aberrant neuroplasticity.|journal=Advances in Neurology|year=2004|volume=94|pages=19–28|pmid=14509650}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The muscular system, specifically skeletal muscle, creates movement around bone joints, and the [[central nervous system]] is imperative in directing skeletal muscles in motor movements.&lt;ref name="Physiology 2" /&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Components of the Nervous System.png|thumb|right|Components of the Nervous System]]

Neuromechanics is the field of study that combines neuroscience and biomechanics in an effort to understand movement and its relationship with the brain.   Neuromechanics is an area that attempts to combine the efforts of muscles, sensory organs, pattern generators in the brain, and the central nervous system itself to explain motion.&lt;ref name="Neuromechanics definition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nishikawa|first=K |author2=Biewener, AA |author3=Aerts, P |author4=Ahn, AN |author5=Chiel, HJ |author6=Daley, MA |author7=Daniel, TL |author8=Full, RJ |author9=Hale, ME |author10=Hedrick, TL |author11=Lappin, AK |author12=Nichols, TR |author13=Quinn, RD |author14=Satterlie, RA |author15=Szymik, B |title=Neuromechanics: an integrative approach for understanding motor control.|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=July 2007|volume=47|issue=1|pages=16–54|pmid=21672819|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/1/16.full.pdf+html|accessdate=27 November 2013|doi=10.1093/icb/icm024}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Neuromechanics applications include easing health problems and designing and controlling robotic systems.&lt;ref name="Neuromechanics definition" /&gt;

===Neuroscience===
Neuroscience is the study of the [[nervous system]].  The nervous system is divided into two sub-systems: the [[peripheral nervous system]] and the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="Physiology 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Constanzo|first=Linda|title=Physiology|year=2013|publisher=W B Saunders Co|isbn=145570847X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peripheral nervous system is then composed of three sub-systems: the [[somatic nervous system]], the [[autonomic nervous system]], and the [[autonomic nervous system|visceral nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Physiology Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanzo|first=Linda|title=Physiology|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=9781416062165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The autonomic nervous system is also broken down into the [[sympathetic nervous system]], the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], and the [[enteric nervous system]].  The nervous system responsible for voluntary motion, including lower limb motion, is the [[somatic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Neuroscience Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Noback|first=Charles|title=The Human Nervous System: Structure and Function|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=1588290395|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnRO3A_cS44C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=somatic+nervous+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JXlDUqa4DYbc8wTNhoCQDA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=somatic%20nervous%20system&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the somatic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system, motion also involves use of elements of the central nervous system: the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref name="Neuroscience Textbook" /&gt;

Neuroscience contributes to human neuromechanics by studying how different neurological diseases contribute to biomechanical problems and changes in typical movement.  Neuroscience deals with studying the cause of visible problems.

===Biomechanics===
Biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of living systems such as humans, animals, and other organisms by means of [[mechanics]].  Much of biomechanics is concerned with simple motor tasks such as walking.  Walking can be defined by the [[gait|gait cycle]].  The gait cycle is a repetitive event that consists of one full step from heel-strike to the next heel-strike in the same foot.  It can be divided into two phases: [[gait|stance phase]] and [[gait|swing phase]].&lt;ref name="Perry GC Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Jacqueline|title=Gait Analysis: Normal and Pathological Function|year=2010|publisher=Slack Incorporated|isbn=1556427662|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DICTQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=gait+analysis+perry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b39DUtaMIYrq8wTv_YEY&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stance phase consists of the time during which the heel strikes the ground to the point in time at which the toe leaves the ground.&lt;ref name="Perry GC Textbook" /&gt;  Swing phase consists of the rest of the gait cycle, the time between the toe leaving the ground to the next heel strike.&lt;ref name="Perry GC Textbook" /&gt;

Biomechanics contributes to neuromechanics by studying how the body responds to different conditions whether they be neurological diseases or physical impairments.  Biomechanics deals with studying the effect that results from such conditions.

== Inverted Pendulum Theory ==
[[File:Inverted Pendulum.png|thumb|right|Center of mass on a massless leg travelling along the trunk trajectory path in inverted pendulum theory.  Velocity vectors are shown perpendicular to the ground reaction force at time 1 and time 2.]]

The [[inverted pendulum theory of gait]] is a neuromechanical approach to understanding human movement.  In the theory, the weight of the body is reduced to a center of mass resting on a massless leg at a single support.  The ground reaction force travels from the center of pressure at the bottom of the massless leg to the center of mass at the top of the massless leg.  The velocity vector of the center of mass is always perpendicular to the ground reaction force.&lt;ref name="The six determinants of gait and inverted pendulum theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Arthur|title=The six determinants of gait and the inverted pendulum analogy: A dynamic walking perspective|journal=Human Movement Science|date=6 July 2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=617–656|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167945707000309/1-s2.0-S0167945707000309-main.pdf?_tid=d6e9acb0-470b-11e3-960f-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1383760376_ef1816c5ebd285ac92bea8ed9bca5ecd|accessdate=6 November 2013|doi=10.1016/j.humov.2007.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walking consists of alternating single-support and double-support phases.  The single-support phase occurs when one leg is in contact with the ground while the double-support phase occurs when two legs are in contact with the ground.&lt;ref name="Inverted Pendulum - Step-to-Step transitions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Arthur|author2=Donelan, Ruina |title=Energetic Consequences of Walking Like an Inverted Pendulum: Step-to-Step Transitions|journal=Exercise Sport Science Review|year=2005|volume=33|issue=2|pages=88–97|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~artkuo/Papers/ESSR05.pdf|doi=10.1097/00003677-200504000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological influences===

The inverted pendulum is stabilized by constant feedback from the brain and can operate even in the presence of [[dissociated sensory loss|sensory loss]].  In animals who have lost all sensory input to the moving limb, the variables produced by gait (center of mass acceleration, velocity of animal, and position of the animal) remain constant between both groups.&lt;ref name="Sensorimotor (Ting)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lockhart|first=Daniel|author2=Ting |title=Optimal sensorimotor transformations for balance|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=16 September 2007|volume=10|pages=1329–1336|doi=10.1038/nn1986|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n10/pdf/nn1986.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2013|issue=10|pmid=17873869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During postural control, delayed feedback mechanisms are used in the temporal reproduction of task-level functions such as walking.  The nervous system takes into account feedback from the center of mass acceleration, velocity, and position of an individual and utilizes the information to predict and plan future movements.  Center of mass acceleration is essential in the feedback mechanism as this feedback takes place before any significant displacement data can be determined.&lt;ref name="Feedback Model"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welch|first=Torrence|author2=Ting |title=A Feedback Model Reproduces Muscle Activity During Human Postural Responses to Support-Surface Transitions|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=19 December 2007|volume=99|pages=1032–1038|doi=10.1152/jn.01110.2007|url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/99/2/1032.full.pdf+html|accessdate=6 November 2013|issue=2|pmid=18094102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The inverted pendulum theory directly contradicts the [[six determinants of gait]], another theory for gait analysis.&lt;ref name="Gait Analysis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuccurullo|first=Sara|title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Board Review|year=2009|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|isbn=1933864184|pages=457–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The six determinants of gait predict very high energy expenditure for the sinusoidal motion of the Center of Mass during gait, while the inverted pendulum theory offers the possibility that energy expenditure can be  near zero.&lt;ref name="The six determinants of gait and inverted pendulum theory" /&gt; Paradoxically,  the inverted pendulum theory predicts that little to no work is required for walking.&lt;ref name="The six determinants of gait and inverted pendulum theory" /&gt;

==Electromyography==
Electromyography (EMG) is a tool used to measure the electrical outputs produced by [[skeletal muscles]] upon activation.  Motor nerves innervate skeletal muscles and cause contraction upon command from the central nervous system.  This contraction is measured by EMG and is typically measured on the scale of millivolts (mV).  Another form of EMG data that is analyzed is integrated EMG (iEMG) data.  iEMG measures the area under the EMG signal which corresponds to the overall muscle effort rather than the effort at a specific instant.

=== Equipment===
There are four instrumentation components used to detect these signals: (1) the signal source, (2) the transducer used to detect the signal, (3) the amplifier, and (4) the signal processing circuit.&lt;ref name="Electromyography in Biomechanics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soderberg|first=Gary|author2=Cook |title=Electromyography in Biomechanics|journal=Journal of the American Physical Therapy Association|date=December 1984|volume=64|issue=12|pages=1813–1820|url=http://physther.org/content/64/12/1813.full.pdf+html|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signal source refers to the location at which the EMG electrode is place.  EMG signal acquisition is dependent on distance from the electrode to the muscle fiber, so placement is imperative.  The transducer used to detect the signal is an EMG electrode than transforms the [[biosignal|bioelectric signal]] from the muscle to a readable electric signal.&lt;ref name="Electromyography in Biomechanics" /&gt;  The amplifier reproduces and undistorted bioelectric signal and also allows for noise reduction in the signal.&lt;ref name="Electromyography in Biomechanics" /&gt;  Signal processing involves taking the recorded electrical impulses, filtering them, and enveloping the data.&lt;ref name="Electromyography in Biomechanics" /&gt;

=== Latency ===

Latency is a measure of the time span between the activation of a muscle and its peak EMG value.  Latency is used as a means to diagnose disorders of the nervous system such as a [[herniated disc]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), or [[myasthenia gravis]] (MG).&lt;ref name="EMG and NCS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electromyogram (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies|date=1 March 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/electromyogram-emg-and-nerve-conduction-studies|publisher=WebMD, LLC|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These disorders may cause a disruption of the signal at the muscle, the nerve, or the junction between the muscle and the nerve.

The use of EMG to identify nervous systems disorders is known as a [[nerve conduction study]] (NCS).  Nerve conduction studies can only diagnose diseases on the muscular and nerve level.

== Muscle Synergies ==
[[File:Muscle Synergies.png|thumb|right|Three-tiered hierarchy of the muscle synergy hypothesis with m synergies and n effector muscles.]]

A muscle synergy is a group of [[synergist| synergistic muscles]] and [[agonist (muscle)|agonists]] that work together to perform a motor task.  A muscle synergy is composed of agonist and synergistic muscles.  An agonist muscle is a muscle that contracts individually, and it can cause a cascade of motion in neighboring muscles.  Synergistic muscles aid the agonist muscles in motor control tasks, but they act against excess motion that the agonists may create.

=== Muscle synergy hypothesis===

The muscle synergy hypothesis is based on the assumption that the central nervous system controls muscle groups independently rather than individual muscles

In tier one, a motor task vector is created by the central nervous system.  The central nervous system then transforms the muscle vector to act upon a group of muscle synergies in tier two.  Then in tier three, muscle synergies define a specific ratio of the motor task for each muscle and assign it to its respective muscle to act upon the joint to perform the motor task.

=== Redundancy===
Redundancy plays a large role in muscle synergy.  Muscle redundancy is a degrees of freedom problem on the muscular level.&lt;ref name="Muscle synergy and redundancy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kutch|first=Jason|title=Signal in Human Motor Unsteadiness: Determining the Action and Activity of Muscles|year=2008|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/60825/jkutch_1.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central nervous system is presented with the opportunity to coordinate muscle movements, and it must choose one out of many.  The muscle redundancy problem is a result of more muscle vectors than dimensions in the task space.  Muscles can only generate tension by pulling, not pushing.  This results in many muscle force vectors in multiple directions rather than a push and pull in the same direction.

One debate on muscle synergies is between the prime mover strategy and the cooperation strategy.&lt;ref name="Muscle synergy and redundancy" /&gt;  The prime mover strategy arises when a muscle's vector can act in the same direction as the mechanical action vector, the vector of the limb's motion.  The cooperation strategy, however, takes place when no muscle can act directly in the vector direction of the mechanical action resulting in a coordination of multiple muscles to achieve the task.  The prime mover strategy over time has declined in popularity as it has been found through electromyography studies that no one muscle consistently provides more force that other muscles that are acting to move about a joint.&lt;ref name="Prime Mover Refuter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=T.S.|author2=Rovai, Rymer |title=Strategies for muscle activation during isometric torque generation at the human elbow|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1 December 1989|volume=62|issue=6|pages=1201–1212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms ===

The muscle synergy theory is difficult to falsify.&lt;ref name="Criticisms Muscle Synergy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tresch|first=Matthew C.|author2=Jarc, A |title=The case for and against muscle synergies|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=601–607|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.002|pmid=19828310|pmc=2818278}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Though experimentation has shown that groups of muscles indeed work together to control motor tasks, neural connections allow for individual muscles to be activated.  Though individual muscle activation may contradict muscle synergy, it also obscures it.  Activation of individual muscles may override or block the input from and overall effect of muscle synergies.&lt;ref name="Criticisms Muscle Synergy" /&gt;

== Adaptation ==
[[File:Ankle-foot-orthosis.png|thumb|right|Ankle-foot-orthosis]]
[[Adaptation]] in the neuromechanical sense is the body's ability to change an action to better suit the situation or environment in which it is acting.  Adaptation can be a result of injury, fatigue, or practice.  Adaptation can be measured in a variety of ways: electromyography, three-dimensional reconstruction of joints, and changes in other variables pertaining to the specific adaptation being studied.

=== Injury ===
Injury can cause adaptation in a number of ways.  Compensation is a large factor in injury adaptation.  Compensation is a result of one or more weakened muscles.  The brain is given the task to perform a certain motor task, and once a muscle has been weakened, the brain computes energy ratios to send to other muscles to perform the original task in the desired fashion.  Change in muscle contribution is not the only byproduct of a muscle-related injury.  Change in loading of the joint is another result which, if prolonged, can be harmful for the individual.&lt;ref name="Injury Adaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Wen|author2=Maitland |title=The effect of hamstring muscle compensation for anterior laxity in the ACL-deficient knee during gait|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|date=29 October 1999|volume=33|pages=871–879|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0021929000000476/1-s2.0-S0021929000000476-main.pdf?_tid=f0ee9978-4e17-11e3-a9b0-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1384535228_7ced92cd504fe2f8a43c9350520cc244|accessdate=15 November 2013|doi=10.1016/s0021-9290(00)00047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatigue ===
Muscle fatigue is the neuromuscular adaptation to challenges over a period of time.  The use of motor units over a period of time can result in changes in the motor command from the brain.  Since the force of contraction cannot be changed, the brain instead recruits more motor units to achieve maximal muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="Fatigue Adaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enoka|first=Roger|author2=Stuart |title=Neurobiology of muscle fatigue|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=1 May 1992|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1631–1648|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/72/5/1631.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recruitment of motor units varies from muscle to muscle depending on the upper limit of motor recruitment in the muscle.&lt;ref name="Fatigue Adaptation" /&gt;

=== Practice ===
Adaptation due to practice can be a result of intended practice such as sports or unintended practice such as wearing an [[orthotics|orthosis]].  In athletes, repetition results in [[muscle memory]].  The motor task becomes a long-term memory that can be repeated without much conscious effort.  This allows the athlete to focus on fine-tuning their motor task strategy.  Resistance to fatigue also comes with practice as the muscle is strengthened, but the speed at which an athlete can complete a motor task is also increased with practice.&lt;ref name="Practice Adaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masci|first=Ilaria|author2=Vannozzi, Gizzi|author3=Bellotti, Felici|title=Neuromechanical evidence of improved neuromuscular control around knee joint in volleyball players|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|date=22 September 2009|volume=108|pages=443–450|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/301/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00421-009-1226-z.pdf?auth66=1384706495_d2472617440ae565ce13b74cab91bb83&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2013|doi=10.1007/s00421-009-1226-z}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volleyball players compared to non-jumpers show more repeatable control of muscles surrounding the knee that is controlled by co-activation in the single jump condition.&lt;ref name="Practice Adaptation" /&gt;  In the repeated jump condition, both volleyball players and non-jumpers have a linear decrease in normalized jump flight time.&lt;ref name="Practice Adaptation" /&gt;  Though the normalized linear decrease is the same for athletes and non-athletes, athletes consistently have higher flight times.

There is also adaptation associated with use of a [[prosthetics|prosthesis]] or an orthosis.  This operates similarly to adaptation due to fatigue; however, muscles can actually be fatigued or alter their mechanical contribution to a motor task as a result of wearing the orthosis.  An ankle foot orthosis is a common solution to injury of the lower limb, specifically around the ankle joint.  An ankle foot orthosis can be assistive or resistive.  An assistive ankle orthosis encourages ankle movement, and a resistive ankle orthosis inhibits ankle movement.&lt;ref name="Hopping Source"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=YH|author2=Roiz, RA |author3=Auyang, AG |title=Intralimb compensation strategy depends on the nature of joint perturbation in human hopping.|journal=Journal of biomechanics|year=2008|volume=41|issue=9|pages=1832–9|pmid=18499112|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon wearing an assistive ankle foot orthosis, individuals have decreased EMG amplitude and joint stiffness over time while the opposite occurs for resistive ankle foot orthoses.&lt;ref name="Hopping Source" /&gt;   Additionally, not only can electromyography readings differ, but the physical path that joints travel along can be altered as well.&lt;ref name="Practice Adaptation II"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferris|first=Daniel |author2=Bohra |author3=Lukos |author4=Kinnaird |title=Neuromechanical adaptation to hopping with an elastic ankle-foot orthosis|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=22 September 2005|volume=100|pages=163–170|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00821.2005 |pmid=16179395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Ornament (disambiguation){{!}}Ornament}}
In [[architecture]] and [[decorative art]], '''ornament''' is a decoration used to [[embellish]] parts of a building or object.  Large figurative elements such as [[monumental sculpture]] and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as '''applied ornament'''; in other [[applied arts]] the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or [[vitreous enamel]] may be used.  

A wide variety of decorative styles and [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] have been developed for architecture and the applied arts, including [[pottery]], [[furniture]], [[metalwork]]. In [[textiles]], [[wallpaper]] and other objects where the decoration may be the main justification for its existence, the terms pattern or design are more likely to be used.  The vast range of motifs used in ornament draw from geometrical shapes and patterns, plants, and human and animal figures.  Across [[Eurasia]] and the [[Mediterranean]] world there has been a rich and linked tradition of plant-based ornament for over three thousand years; traditional ornament from other parts of the world typically relies more on geometrical and animal motifs.  

In a 1941 essay,&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, John (1941) printed in ''Heavenly Mansions'' 1963, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]] called it "surface modulation". The earliest decoration and ornament often survives from prehistoric cultures in simple markings on pottery, where decoration in other materials (including [[tattoo]]s) has been lost. Where the [[potter's wheel]] was used, the technology made some kinds of decoration very easy; [[weaving]] is another technology which also lends itself very easily to decoration or pattern, and to some extent dictates its form. Ornament has been evident in [[civilization]]s since the beginning of [[recorded history]], ranging from [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] to the assertive lack of ornament of 20th century [[Modernism|Modernist architecture]].

Ornament implies that the ornamented object has a function that an unornamented equivalent might also fulfill.  Where the object has no such function, but exists only to be a [[work of art]] such as a [[sculpture]] or painting, the term is less likely to be used, except for peripheral elements. In recent centuries a distinction between the [[fine arts]] and applied or [[decorative arts]] has been applied (except for architecture), with ornament mainly seen as a feature of the latter class.

==History==

The history of art in many cultures shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented [[Insular art]] of the [[Book of Kells]] and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods, but was greatly reduced in [[Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in [[Northern Mannerism]], the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]], was checked by [[Neoclassicism]] and the [[Romantic period]], before resuming in the later 19th century [[Victorian decorative arts]] and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and then [[Modernism]]. 
  
The detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen]]: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[Ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] of [[Islamic art]].  While the concept of the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[Mongol invasion of Persia|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles of ornamentation can be studied in reference to the specific [[Cultural heritage|culture]] which developed unique forms of decoration, or modified ornament from other cultures. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian culture is arguably the first civilization to add pure decoration to their buildings. Their ornament takes the forms of the natural world in that climate, decorating the capitals of columns and walls with images of papyrus and palm trees. [[Assyria]]n culture produced ornament which shows influence from Egyptian sources and a number of original themes, including figures of plants and animals of the region.

[[Ancient Greek]] civilization created many new forms of ornament, with regional variations from [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] groups.  The [[Ancient Roman|Romans]] [[romanization (cultural)|Latinized]] the pure forms of the Greek ornament and adapted the forms to every purpose.

==Ornament prints and pattern books==
[[File:Orna103-Simaornamente.png|thumb|right|Elaborated versions of Greco-Roman classical architectural ornaments in ''[[:commons:Category:Meyer's Ornament|Meyer's Ornament]]'']]
[[File:FroissartOurs.jpg|thumb|A detail from the margin of a page of [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|a Late Gothic manuscript]]]]
A few medieval notebooks survive, most famously that of [[Villard de Honnecourt]] (13th century) showing how artists and craftsmen recorded designs they saw for future use. With the arrival of the [[old master print|print]] [[ornament print]]s became an important part of the output of printmakers, especially in Germany, and played a vital role in the rapid diffusion of new Renaissance styles to makers of all sorts of object. As well as revived classical ornament, both architectural and the [[grotesque]] style derived from Roman interior decoration, these included new styles such as the [[moresque]], a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque (a distinction not always clear at the time). 

As printing became cheaper, the single ornament print turned into sets, and then finally books.  From the 16th to the 19th century, [[pattern book]]s were published in Europe which gave access to decorative elements, eventually including those recorded from cultures all over the world. Andrea Palladio's [[I quattro libri dell'architettura]] (Four Books on Architecture) (Venice, 1570),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]],[http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html "Palladio and his Books."]&lt;/ref&gt; which included both drawings of classical Roman buildings and renderings of Palladio's own designs utilizing those motifs, became the most influential book ever written on architecture. Napoleon had the great pyramids and temples of Egypt documented in the ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)]]''. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] published ''[[The Grammar of Ornament]]'' in 1856 with colored illustrations of decoration from Egypt, Turkey, Sicily and Spain. He took residence in the [[Alhambra|Alhambra Palace]] to make drawings and plaster castings of the ornate details of the [[Islamic art|Islamic ornaments]] there, including [[arabesque]]s, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. Interest in [[classical architecture]] was also fueled by the tradition of traveling on [[Grand Tour|The Grand Tour]], and by translation of early literature about architecture in the work of [[Vitruvius]] and [[Michelangelo]].

During the 19th century, the acceptable use of ornament, and its precise definition became the source of aesthetic controversy in academic Western architecture, as architects and their critics searched for a suitable style. "The great question is," [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]] asked in 1847, "are we to have an architecture of our period, a distinct, individual, palpable style of the 19th century?".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Summerson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, when [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] viewed the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844|French Industrial Exposition]] set up on the [[Champs-Elysées]] in Paris, he disapproved in recognizably modern terms of the plaster ornaments in faux-bronze and faux woodgrain:&lt;ref&gt;[http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html Second Republic Exposition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212102110/http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html |date=2006-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both internally and externally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament... If each simple material had been allowed to tell its own tale, and the lines of the construction so arranged as to conduce to a sentiment of grandeur, the qualities of "power" and "truth," which its enormous extent must have necessarily ensured, could have scarcely fail to excite admiration, and that at a very considerable saving of expense. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contacts with other cultures through [[colonialism]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]] expanded the repertory of ornament available to revivalists. After about 1880, photography made details of ornament even more widely available than prints had done.

==Modern ornament==
Modern [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] ornaments are made of wood, plastics, composites, etc. They come in many different colours and shapes.
[[Modern architecture]], conceived of as the elimination of ornament in favor of purely functional structures, left architects the problem of how to properly adorn modern structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sankovitch | first=Anne-Marie | title=Structure/ornament and the modern figuration of architecture | url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html | date= 12/1/1998 | publisher= The Art Bulletin| accessdate=2007-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107140938/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html |archivedate = November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two available routes from this perceived crisis. One was to attempt to devise an ornamental vocabulary that was new and essentially contemporary. This was the route taken by architects like [[Louis Sullivan]] and his pupil [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], or by the unique [[Antoni Gaudí]]. [[Art Nouveau]], for all its excesses, was a conscious effort to evolve such a "natural" vocabulary of ornament.

A more radical route abandoned the use of ornament altogether, as in some designs for objects by [[Christopher Dresser]]. At the time, such unornamented objects could have been found in many unpretending workaday items of industrial design, ceramics produced at the Arabia manufactory in Finland, for instance, or the glass insulators of electric lines.

This latter approach was described by architect [[Adolf Loos]] in his 1908 manifesto, translated into English in 1913 and polemically titled ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', in which he declared that lack of decoration is the sign of an advanced society.  His argument was that ornament is economically inefficient and "morally degenerate", and that reducing ornament was a sign of progress. Modernists were eager to point to American architect [[Louis Sullivan]] as their godfather in the cause of aesthetic simplification, dismissing the knots of intricately patterned ornament that articulated the skin of his structures.

With the work of [[Le Corbusier]] and the [[Bauhaus]] through the 1920s and 1930s, lack of decorative detail became a hallmark of [[modern architecture]] and equated with the moral virtues of honesty, simplicity, and purity.  In 1932 [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] dubbed this the "[[International style (architecture)|International Style]]".  What began as a matter of taste was transformed into an aesthetic mandate.  Modernists declared their way as the only acceptable way to build.  As the style hit its stride in the highly developed postwar work of [[Mies van der Rohe]], the tenets of 1950s modernism became so strict that even accomplished architects like [[Edward Durrell Stone]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] could be ridiculed and effectively ostracized for departing from the aesthetic rules.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

At the same time, the unwritten laws against ornament began to come into serious question.  "Architecture has, with some difficulty, liberated itself from ornament, but it has not liberated itself from the ''fear'' of ornament," [[John Summerson]] observed in 1941. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulshepheard.com/words/slogans-and-battlecries/|title=Slogans and Battlecries {{!}} Paul Shepheard {{!}} Architect {{!}} Writer|website=www.paulshepheard.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very difference between ornament and structure is subtle and perhaps arbitrary.  The pointed arches and flying buttresses of [[Gothic architecture]] are ornamental but structurally necessary; the colorful rhythmic bands of a [[Pietro Belluschi]] International Style skyscraper are integral, not applied, but certainly have ornamental effect. Furthermore, architectural ornament can serve the practical purpose of establishing scale, signaling entries, and aiding wayfinding, and these useful design tactics had been outlawed.  And by the mid-1950s, modernist figureheads [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] had been breaking their own rules by producing highly expressive, sculptural concrete work.

The argument against ornament peaked in 1959 over discussions of the [[Seagram Building]], where [[Mies van der Rohe]] installed a series of structurally unnecessary vertical I-beams on the outside of the building, and by 1984, when [[Philip Johnson]] produced his AT&amp;T Building in Manhattan with an ornamental pink granite neo-Georgian pediment, the argument was effectively over.  In retrospect, critics have seen the [[Sony Building (New York)|AT&amp;T Building]] as the first [[Postmodernist]] building. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Political journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|publisher=mundoelectoral.com|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prehistoric religions''' are the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. The term may cover [[Paleolithic religion]], [[Mesolithic]] religion, [[#Neolithic|Neolithic religion]] and [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation) | Bronze Age religions]].

==Paleolithic==
{{Main|Paleolithic religion}}
 
Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]], may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice (the onset of burial itself being a canonical indicator of [[behavioral modernity]]) since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title= Uniquely Human|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year= 1991| authorlink= Philip Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Gabillou Sorcier.png|thumb|left|150px|Picture of a half-animal half-human being in a Paleolithic [[cave painting]] in [[Dordogne]], [[France]] which archeologists believe may provide evidence for early shamanic practices]]
A number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies such as [[Neanderthal]] societies may also have practiced early forms of [[totemism]] or of [[animal worship]]. Emil Bächler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Neanderthal]] [[bear cult|bear-cult]] existed ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435).  A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BCE (originating from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert) has been denied by the original investigators of the site.&lt;ref&gt;World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30). World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago. ScienceDaily. Retrieved March 2, 2008, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061130081347.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Robbins|first= Lawrence H.|author2= Alec C. Campbell|author3= George A. Brook|author4= Michael L. Murphy|title= World's Oldest Ritual Site?

Narr |title= Prehistoric religion |accessdate= 2008-03-28 |work= Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic intertwined with hunting rites.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt; For instance, archeological evidence from [[Paleolithic art]]  and from bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently had a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism in which a bear was shot with [[arrow]]s, then finished off with a shot in the lungs and ritualistically buried near a clay bear-statue covered by a bear fur, with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt;

==Neolithic==
There are no extant textual sources from the [[Neolithic]] era, the most recent available dating from the [[Bronze Age]], and therefore all statements about any [[belief system]]s Neolithic societies may have possessed are glimpsed from archaeology.

[[Jacques Cauvin]] suggested that the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was influenced by an important theme he termed the "[[Jacques Cauvin#The Revolution of the Symbols|Revolution of the Symbols]]", suggesting the birth of "religion" in the Neolithic. He argued that Neolithic humans were influenced by a change in thinking as much as changes in the environment and noted a series of stages in this process.&lt;ref name="Aurenche"&gt;Olivier Aurenche, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_2001_num_27_2_4728 Jacques Cauvin et la préhistoire du Levant], Paléorient, Volume 27, Number 27-2, pp. 5-11, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His work suggested important concepts in the evolution of human thinking, by examining figurines and early art depicting first women as goddesses and bulls as gods, he suggested several important ideas about the evolution of perception and duality.&lt;ref name="CauvinWatkins2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacques Cauvin|author2=Trevor Watkins|title=The birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4epGQpNyucC|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65135-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structures known as [[circular enclosure (archaeology)|Circular Enclosures]] built in Central Europe during the 5th millennium BCE have been interpreted as serving a cultic function. In the case of the [[Goseck circle]], remains of [[human sacrifice]] were found. Many of these structures had openings aligned with sunset and/or sunrise at the [[solstice]]s, suggesting that they served as a means of maintaining a [[lunisolar calendar]]. The construction of [[Megalithic]] monuments in Europe also began in the 5th millennium, and continued throughout the Neolithic and in some areas well into the early Bronze Age.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], pioneer of [[feminist archaeology]], put forward a notion of a "woman-centered" society surrounding "goddess worship" in [[Neolithic Europe]]. The Neolithic "matristic" cultures would have been replaced by [[patriarchy]] only with the arrival of the [[Bronze Age]]. Gimbutas' views on this matter do not have widespread support today.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeologist Sarah M. Nelson criticizes Gimbutas suggesting that she used the same techniques used in the past to disparage women but in this case to glorify them, and quotes another archaeologist, Pamela Russell, as saying "The archaeological evidence is, in some cases, distorted enough to make a careful prehistorian shudder". See {{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Sarah M|title=Gender in archaeology: analyzing power and prestige|year=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0496-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46UlbBqCE9AC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=neolithic+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B-tJTMb6G4__Ocaw2ZgD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pamela%20russell&amp;f=false|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bronze Age==
{{Main|Religions of the ancient Near East|Minoan religion|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

===Reconstructions===
The early [[Bronze Age]] [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] (itself [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]]), and the attested early [[Semitic gods]], are presumed continuations of certain traditions of the late Neolithic.

====Bronze Age Europe====
Hints to the religion of [[Bronze Age Europe]] include images of [[solar barge]]s, frequent appearance of the [[Sun cross]], deposits of bronze [[axe]]s, and later [[sickle]]s, so-called [[moon idol]]s, the conical [[golden hat]]s, the [[Nebra skydisk]], and burial in [[tumulus|tumuli]], but also [[cremation]] as practised by the [[Urnfield culture]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Axial Age}}
While the [[Iron Age]] religions of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Near East]], [[Iron Age India|India]] and [[Iron Age China|China]] are well attested in written sources, much of [[Iron Age Europe]], from the period of about 700 BCE down to the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], falls within the prehistoric period. There are scarce accounts of non-Mediterranean religious customs in the records of Hellenistic and Roman era [[Greek ethnography|ethnography]].
*[[Scythian mythology]] ([[Herodotus]])
*[[Celtic polytheism]] ([[Posidonius]])
*[[Paleo-Balkan mythology]]
*[[Germanic polytheism]] ([[Tacitus]])
*[[Slavic polytheism]] ([[Procopius]])
*[[Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]]

In the case of Circumpolar religion ([[Shamanism in Siberia]], [[Finnic mythology]]), [[traditional African religions]], [[native American religions]] and [[Pacific religions]], the prehistoric era mostly ends only with the [[Early Modern period]] and European [[colonialism]]. These traditions were often only first recorded in the context of [[Christianization]].

For these reasons, the interpretations and understanding of the Iron Age cult in Europe has to rely primarily on archaeological material.

'''Proteak''' is a forestry company that cultivates [[teak]] trees on plantations located on reclaimed ranch lands in the dry tropical regions of [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]]. Based out of [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], Proteak has satellite offices in [[Wimberley]], [[Texas]] and [[Tepic]], [[Mexico]]. At their manufacturing facilities, Proteak produces a range of teak products including: [[cutting board]]s, [[butcher block]]s, [[deck (building)|decking]], [[flooring]] and [[lumber]].

== History ==
Proteak Renewable Forestry, SAPIB was founded in 2000 by a group of investors in the [[US]] and [[Mexico]]. Forestry management operations began in 2000 with the planting of teak forests along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]]. In 2006, Proteak began to offer its first commercial product lines.

In 2010, Proteak reported that having over 8,000 acres&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proteak.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; under cultivation on reclaimed ranch lands, while protecting roughly 2,000 of virgin tropical forests adjacent to those plantations. As part of the company's operating guidelines, Proteak preserves standing forests on the properties that it acquires. Proteak's sustainable practices have earned its plantations a [[Forest Stewardship Council]] certificate.

Proteak's IPO closed on June 30, 2010, selling approximately 79 million shares&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3024399920100630&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aw5mwv7fUknY&amp;pos=7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plantation Teak ==

Due to the high demand for teak lumber, commercial forestry operations began to grow teak in dry tropical climates around the world throughout the 20th century. The deforestation of teak's natural range in [[Southeast Asia]] and trade sanctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/burma/burma.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527120417/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/burma/burma.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed by the [[US Treasury Department]], have not only served to drive the cost of [[teak]] higher, but have also led consumers to look for environmentally sustainable sources of tropical hardwood lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theinteriorevolution.com/archives/1536&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plantation Teak]] can be cultivated sustainably and is typically priced substantially lower than old growth teak.

Although the world's largest remaining teak forests are located inside [[Burma]], the human rights violations perpetrated by the government of [[Myanmar]] have cause some consumers to refer to teak from the region as "conflict teak."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/thailand/091214/thailand-conflict-timber-burmese-teak?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rumors suggest that teak trees grown on a plantation exhibit lower densities than those grown in Southeast Asia. However, studies conducted by the [[USDA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2001/willi01d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have found no significant correlation between growth rate and its density.

== Kitchen products ==
Proteak's most visible product line include cutting boards, butcher blocks, counter tops and other kitchen accessories. The timber used to manufacture these products comes entirely from Proteak's FSC certified plantations.

Teak is often used in kitchen applications because of its highly resilient characteristics compared to other hardwoods. Equipped with a naturally high level of oily resins called tectoquinones, teak wood has a unique ability to repel moisture, fungi, warping and rot. Plantation teak kitchen products are often popular with environmentally conscious chefs who prefer the material for its relatively small [[ecological footprint]].

Compared with other sustainable options like bamboo, teak cutting boards and [[butcher blocks]] are often considered to result in less wear on knife blades. [[End grain]] cutting boards showcase the tree's natural rings and hide knife marks and wear. Other manufacturing styles, such as edge grain or face grain are generally more affordable thanks to the efficiency of their construction.

== Decking and lumber ==
Teak lumber and decking make up another prominent portion of Proteak's commercial offerings through it subsidiary Teakyard. Boards cut from teak logs exhibit an attractive golden or brown complexion with a tight grain pattern. Often used in the construction of boats, patios, and outdoor furniture, teak lumber is known for its ability to resist rot, warping and cracking.

[[Plantation teak]] lumber is also available at a significantly lower price than teak imported from Burma's old-growth forests. Likewise, it's often preferred by consumers who are looking for an ethical or environmentally friendly teak option for their construction project.

== Slow growth ==
"Slow growth" attempts to duplicate old-growth teak with the proper growing conditions. Proteak employs the slow growth process in the cultivation of its [[plantation teak]] by selecting plantation sites that mimic the soil and precipitation characteristics of [[Southeast Asia]].

Proteak produces its timber without the use of fertilizers or irrigation, both of which speed up the growth of the wood and alter the teak's famous grain pattern.

'''Rossall School''' is a British, fee paying [[Coeducation|co-educational]], [[independent school]], between [[Cleveleys]] and [[Fleetwood]], [[Lancashire]]. Rossall was founded in 1844 by [[St. Vincent Beechey|St Vincent Beechey]] as a sister school to [[Marlborough College]] which had been founded the previous year. Its establishment was "to provide, at a moderate cost, for the sons of Clergymen and others, a classical, mathematical and general education of the highest class, and to do all things necessary, incidental, or conducive to the attainment of the above objects."&lt;ref name="trr"&gt;''The Rossall Register 1844–1894'' - Anguline Research Archives - p.44&lt;/ref&gt; 
Along with [[Cheltenham College|Cheltenham]], [[Lancing College|Lancing]] and [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], Rossall was part of a flurry of expansion in education during the early [[Victorian period]]. These schools were later complemented by others such as [[Clifton College|Clifton]], [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]], [[Malvern College|Malvern]] and [[Radley College|Radley]].

Set in a {{convert|161|acre|km2|sing=on}} estate next to Rossall Beach, Rossall is also a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and was granted a [[royal charter]] on 21 October 1890.&lt;ref name="trr" /&gt; It accepts students between the ages of 2 and 18 and also has an associated [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]]. Rossall's campus has a large array of facilities for extracurricular activities and the school is home to the Lawrence House Space Science and Astronomy Centre, the only facility of its type in the UK. Over the years, Rossall has adapted itself to changing attitudes in education, and was the first school in the UK to have a [[Combined Cadet Force]] and one of the first to introduce the [[International Baccalaureate]] and host a dedicated international study centre on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice.jsp?id=advice_overseas_choosing_school_international UK Boarding Schools - private schools, public schools and boarding schools in the UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807002243/http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice.jsp?id=advice_overseas_choosing_school_international |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:InsideSumnerlibrary.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Inside the Sumner Library]]

The idea of founding a boarding school on the Fylde coast originates with a [[Corsican people|Corsican]] man named Zenon Vantini.  As the owner of the [[North Euston Hotel]] in [[Fleetwood]],&lt;ref name="GalePolden4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vantini opened his hotel expecting many visitors but few people arrived.  To boost the number of visitors to Fleetwood and help his hotel and the local economy, Vantini opened two schools in the vicinity of Fleetwood, one for boys and another for girls, totalling 1,000 students.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt;  The early Victorian period was marked by high child mortality rates, and Vantini expected that in the long term, the schools could be funded by a form of [[tontine]] insurance scheme, whereby the cost to educate children who reached their teenage years was offset by those who had died in infancy.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt;

Vantini called a meeting at the North Euston Hotel to discuss the foundation of the schools with local businessmen and clergy.&lt;ref name="GalePolden4" /&gt; It was decided that any school that was to be founded would be directly affiliated to the Church of England. This was to be the first major Church of England school in the north of England and a sister school to [[Marlborough College]] which had opened the previous year. It was soon established that there was little hope of founding the girls' school and this idea was abandoned, with the boys' school pupil numbers reduced to 200.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Vantini's involvement with the scheme steadily dissipated, [[St. Vincent Beechey|Rev. St. Vincent Beechey]], the parish priest of Fleetwood, took over.

Beechey set about finding the funds required to set up such a school. Beechey got the financial support of [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood]], [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] as patron, the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] as vice-president and [[John Bird Sumner]], then [[Bishop of Chester]] and later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], as visitor.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5" /&gt; As a result of [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood|Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood's]] financial problems from over-investing in the development of Fleetwood, he agreed to lease his ancestral home of Rossall Hall to the school for 21 years, with the option of buying it for £7,000 after ten years.&lt;ref name="GalePolden5" /&gt; The Northern Church of England Boarding School, renamed Rossall College under the reign of William Osborne, opened on 22 August 1844,

===1844 to 1914===
Initial problems were not unusual for boarding schools of the time, though Rossall nearly shut down in its infancy because of huge outbreaks of [[scarlet fever]]. The foundation stone to the school chapel, now the Sumner Library, was laid in 1848 by the first ever [[Bishop of Manchester]], [[James Prince Lee]] - the diocese having only been created that same year. Rossall's swift and successful development can be seen by its inclusion in the book ''The Great Schools of England'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staunton|first=Howard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage|title=The Great Schools of England|publisher=Sampson Low, Son, and Marston|date=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chapel was constructed in the 1860s and the school underwent further development from the 1880s to 1900 to accommodate more students and to create further facilities such as the gym which still stands. In 1874 Rossall became the first [[Church of England]] school to play a [[Catholic school]], [[Stonyhurst College]], in an inter-school sports fixture, at cricket. Protestant newspapers warned against such activities advising Rossall parents to be wary of encroaching papism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Athleticism in the Victorian and Edwardian Public School |last=Mangan|first=J.A.|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location= |isbn=0-7146-8043-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irW3lfgplM4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=stonyhurst+rossall+|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, roughly one hundred O.R.s served in the Boer War, nearly half of them winning distinctions or [[mentions in despatches]]. Seventeen old boys died in active service, all of whom are now commemorated in the stalls of the school chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossall was widely considered to be in top 30 public schools in the UK by the end of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign also earning itself a place in the [[independent school (UK)#Public Schools Yearbook|Public Schools Yearbook]] and the Public School News section of the [[Cambridge Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080/0046760032000151492|author=William Whyte|date=6 November 2003|title=Building a public school community 1860–1910|doi=10.1080/0046760032000151492|journal=History of Education|volume=32|pages=601–626|issue=6|access-date=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204937/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080%2F0046760032000151492|archive-date=30 September 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some financial difficulties as a result of fund embezzling by a bursar, by the end of the 1920s Rossall's academic results were amongst the best in the country with record numbers achieving scholarships to [[Oxbridge]] and attaining distinctions in the Higher Certificate examinations.&lt;ref name="GalePolden96"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914 to 1945===
During the world wars large numbers of Old Rossallians lost their lives in combat, 297 in World War I alone&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the majority of whom are now commemorated in the extension memorial chapel. Rossall has a memorial plaque at St Georges Chapel by the [[Menin Gate]] in honour of its fallen, alongside schools such as [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2007/11/12/1041286.html |title=This Is Lancashire - Memorial for Great War pupils |publisher=Archive.thisislancashire.co.uk |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  1,617 ORs fought in World War I,&lt;ref&gt;'The Tide Flows On' - Derek Winterbottom (2006, Manx Press), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 300 of whom received war honours.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Rossall had made plans to accommodate [[Westminster School]]&lt;ref name="cent"&gt;''A Centenary History of Rossall School'' - William Furness - (Gale and Polden, 1944) p.170&lt;/ref&gt; however these plans were scrapped when the government requisitioned the campus for several departments of the [[Office of Works]], the [[Board of Education]] and the [[Ministry of Pensions]]. As a result, the school moved to [[Naworth Castle]].&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt; The government departments put up prefabricated buildings and found other premises close by as soon as possible, and left in 1940. The school returned and took in a school from the south-east, as the Westminster School had found an alternative solution. The eventual choice was that of [[Alleyn's School|Alleyn's]] who had to be evacuated from London as a result of the risk of bombing.&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt; Another side effect of the war was that there was only one centenary dinner celebrating the 100th year of Rossall. It was conducted by Old Rossallians imprisoned in [[Changi Prison]], a notorious [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp in Singapore during the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref name="rossallianclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/about/|title=About the Rossallian Club|accessdate=15 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007162633/http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/about/|archive-date=7 October 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945 to present===
[[Benjamin Britten]] gave a concert in Big School in 1954. It continued to thrive and in the 1970s, in a bid to ensure the highest standards during a period of declining boarding, girls were allowed to enrol. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the school pushed on with a development programme and had royal visits including the Queen in 1994 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its foundation. The school went through great financial difficulty at the turn of the millennium.

Rossall has since had more investment than previously, with the boarding houses including Maltese Cross currently undergoing varying degrees of refurbishment. The middle school now runs from years 7 to 9, one year longer than traditionally. As a part of the modernising of the school the [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was introduced as an alternative to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] in 1998, being only the 3rd school in the UK to do so, and there is now an international boarding contingent.

Rossall promotes relatively affordable private education in relation to the rest of the UK - 80% of those who attend the school are the first in their family to attend an independent school and a large number of [[scholarships]] and [[bursaries]] are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/uploads/pubdownloads/newsletter12-04.pdf |title={title} |access-date=27 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927121524/http://www.rossallianclub.co.uk/uploads/pubdownloads/newsletter12-04.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2007 saw the return of the Rossall Summer School - developed to give children from outside the UK the opportunity to develop their English speaking skills as well as being a chance for those thinking of going to a boarding school to consider whether they are suited to the lifestyle.

[[File:RossallDiningHall1.jpg|thumb|right|The South End of the Dining Hall]]

===Architecture===

====The Archway====
This was erected in 1867, under the reign of William Osborne, with the foundation stone being laid by [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rossall Register 1844–1894'' - Anguline Research Archives - p.28&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been designed by [[Edward Graham Paley]]. It is clearly modelled on the entrance gates of the [[Oxbridge]] colleges and originally had large wooden doors which were locked at night; these have since been removed for improvements in access.&lt;ref name="TourRossall5"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chapel====
In the 1860s a new school chapel was built to cope with the increasing number of students, the old chapel serving, as it does today, as the school library. The new chapel was designed by [[Edward Graham Paley]],&lt;ref name="TourRossall2"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; extended by [[Robert Lorimer]] and includes carvings by [[Eric Gill]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall3"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel organ was designed by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall3" /&gt; Rossall celebrated the chapel's 150th Anniversary on 1 April 2012.

====The Dining Hall====
The original school dining hall burnt down in the 1920s. The replacement, the current dining hall, was designed by [[Thomas Worthington (architect)#Legacy|Sir Hubert Worthington]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall6"&gt;''A Tour of Rossall'' - Peter Bennett - (Rossall Archives) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The design was not without fault however - it was constructed from bricks encased in a weatherable coating that would dissolve away to leave it looking in the same condition as the rest of the square. The largest section of wood panelling behind the headmaster's table in the dining hall is made from an oak tree that grew in the back garden of [[George Mallory]].&lt;ref name="GalePolden147"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that it is the largest school dining hall in the country&lt;ref name="GalePolden146"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centenary History of Rossall School, William Furness|author=Gale|author2=Polden|last-author-amp=yes|date=1944|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was described by F. A. M. Webster in his book ''Our Great Public Schools'' as, "one of the most splendid in the country."&lt;ref name="WardLockCo239"&gt;"Our Great Public Schools, Their Traditions, Customs and Games" - F. A. M. Webster - (Ward, Lock and Co., London, 1937) p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four coats of arms attached to the exterior of the dining hall to commemorate the various families associated with Rossall over the years; [[Cardinal Allen|The Allen Family]] for the medieval and renaissance owners of the site, [[Baron Hesketh|The Hesketh Family]] for the [[Church of England|Anglican]] family who acquired the sequestered property of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Allens during the [[English Reformation]], [[Fleetwood baronets|The Fleetwood family]] who intermarried with the Heskeths and became the most recent owners of the site prior to the original loan of Rossall Hall for the opening of the school by their last representative, Sir [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood]] and The Beechey Family for the founder of the school, [[St. Vincent Beechey|The Revd. St. Vincent Beechey]].&lt;ref name="TourRossall6-7"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tour of Rossall|author=Peter Bennett|pages=6 + 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canberra Grammar School====
Stone from Rossall can be found in the cloisters of [[Canberra Grammar School]] along with stones from Eton, Westminster, St Paul's, Charterhouse, Uppingham, Clifton, Tonbridge, Shrewsbury, Sherborne, Wellington, Cheltenham, Repton and Radley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgs.act.edu.au/history.html|title=Canberra Grammar School - History|accessdate=15 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704122547/http://www.cgs.act.edu.au/history.html|archivedate=4 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
The school has specialist sporting, scientific and cultural facilities, including:

====Scientific====

[[File:MuseumTheatre.jpg|thumb|right|The Museum Theatre]]
There are 64 clubs and societies in operation at Rossall including the traditional [[rugby union]], [[Association football|football]], [[Fives]] and [[Hockey]]. There is a [[Croquet|Croquet Club]]. As well as competing in sporting competitions around the country, Rossall plays host to inter-school tournaments. These have included hockey, preparatory school rugby union and basketball. The most notable tournament is the fives competition which in 2005 included [[Lancing College]], [[Malvern College]], [[Uppingham School]] and [[Shrewsbury School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Dominique|date=19 January 2006|url=http://etonfives.co.uk/tournaments/reports.and.results/2005-2006/rossall.schools.2006.html|work=Eton Fives Association Tournament Reports|title=Rossall Schools International 2005–2006: Youth Fives Handball Championship Played at Blackpool Sunday 9th October 2005|accessdate=15 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907235850/http://www.etonfives.co.uk/tournaments/reports.and.results/2005-2006/rossall.schools.2006.html|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Combined Cadet Force====
Rossall was the first school in the United Kingdom to form a [[Combined Cadet Force]] (CCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/cadets/victorian.htm|title=Victorian Cadets|accessdate=15 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070502081839/http://www.archivist.f2s.com/bsu/cadets/victorian.htm |archivedate = 2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in February 1860 when the threat of a French/Irish Catholic invasion was at its height.&lt;ref name="WardLockCo240"&gt;"Our Great Public Schools, Their Traditions, Customs and Games" - F. A. M. Webster - (Ward, Lock and Co., London, 1937) p.240&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Rugby School]] claims to have raised a company of Volunteer Riflemen in 1804&lt;ref name="WardLockCo240" /&gt; Rossall's is the oldest contingent continually in existence and the one from which many other schools drew the inspiration of founding theirs. Other schools such as [[Eton College]] formed their corps a few months after Rossall. From 1890 to 1908 the corps was affiliated to the [[1st Lancashire Engineers|1st Lancashire Engineer Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Monthly Army List''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Westlake, ''Royal Engineers (Volunteers) 1859–1908'', Wembley: R.A. Westlake, 1983, {{ISBN|0-9508530-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is still present in the school today with around 100 [[cadet]]s currently enlisted. In recent years the shooting team has excelled with notable victories in the Home Guard Cup and Loyal’s Regimental Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.privateschoolnews.co.uk/?p=681|publisher=Private School News|title=School’s High Calibre Hot Sots|date=8 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112074202/http://www.privateschoolnews.co.uk/?p=681|archivedate=12 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCF at Rossall received the Queens colours on Tuesday 29 June 2010, to celebrate its 150th anniversary and to acknowledge its status as the oldest cadet corps in the UK.

Through the Cadet Vocational Qualifications Organisation ([[Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation (CVQO)|CVQO]]) the School [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] offers cadets (aged 16–19) and above the opportunity to gain internationally recognised [[BTEC First Diploma]] qualifications in Public Services and Music. Each BTEC First Diploma is the equivalent of 4 GCSEs, grade C - A*.

====Miscellaneous====
Other societies include the [[Astronomy]] club which makes use of the school's telescope and planetarium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/sporting_and_activities/ |title=Rossall School - Sporting and Activities |publisher=Rossall.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927184330/http://www.rossall.co.uk/sporting_and_activities/ |archive-date=27 September 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Literary Society, called the Farrell Society, after the writer J.G.

==Lawrence House Astronomy and Space Science Centre==
[[File:RossallObservatory.jpg|thumb|left|The refurbished Rossall Observatory. (Inset - the observatory before restoration)]]
Rossall is also home to the Lawrence House Astronomy and Space Science Centre - the only centre dedicated solely to the teaching of [[Astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/ | title=School website: Astronomy | accessdate=20 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531063829/http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/ | archive-date=31 May 2007 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project consists of the telescope in Rossall's Assheton Observatory as well as a building of its own containing a lecture theatre, classrooms and a portable planetarium. The telescope is of particular note - being {{convert|12|ft|m}} long, 18&amp;nbsp;inches wide and dating from 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Lancashire Evening Telegraph|url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2003/12/5/517430.html|title=Space is the star at school centre|date=5 December 2003}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective diameter of the telescope is 6.5&amp;nbsp;inches and it has a focal length of f/13.5.&lt;ref name="AAG: News 10-2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/aag_October00/aag504.htm |title=AAG: News 10-2000 |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518003200/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/aag_October00/aag504.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project has been funded by the [[Lawrence House Trust]] and predominantly run by Dr. Nick Lister, originally the head of design and technology at the school and now Astronomer in Residence. Dr. Lister studied at [[Plymouth University]] before getting his PhD from University College London. He is a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and was recently appointed as vice-president of the [[Association for Astronomy Education]], where he succeeded Dr Robert Massey of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], who has now become president of the organisation.&lt;ref name="astronomy169"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/169 |title=Rossall School Astronomy - About Dr Nick Lister |publisher=Rossall.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021192222/http://www.rossall.co.uk/astronomy/169 |archive-date=21 October 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When initial assessments were being made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition as a result of years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from [[brass]] and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration.&lt;ref name="AAG: News 10-2000"/&gt; This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them [[Syd Little]]. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope to go ahead with the project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to go forward with their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal [[Francis Graham Smith|Sir Francis Graham Smith]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpoolcitizen.co.uk/display.var.937403.0.starring_role_for_top_astronomer.php |title=Starring Role For Top Astronomer (from Blackpool Citizen) |publisher=Blackpoolcitizen.co.uk |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange'''&lt;ref name=mainref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = NAS Announces Initiative to Connect Entertainment Industry With Top Experts
  | publisher =  National Academies
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11192008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a program run and developed by
the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to increase public awareness, knowledge, and understanding of science and advanced science technology through its representation in television, film, and other media. It serves as a pro-science movement with the main goal of re-cultivating how science and scientists truly are in order to rid the public of false perceptions on these topics. The Exchange provides entertainment industry professionals with access to credible and knowledgeable scientists and engineers who help to encourage and create effective representations of science and scientists in the media, whether it be on television, in films, plays, etc. The Exchange also helps the science community understand the needs and requirements of the entertainment industry, while making sure science is conveyed in a correct and positive manner to the target audience.

Officially launched in November 2008, the Exchange can be thought of as a partnership between NAS and Hollywood, as it arranges direct consultations between scientists and entertainment professionals who develop science-themed content. This collaboration allows for industry professionals to accurately portray the science that they wish to capture and include in their media production. It also provides scientists and science organizations with the opportunity to communicate effectively with a large audience that may otherwise be hard to reach such as through innovative [[physics outreach]]. It also provides a variety of other services, including scheduling briefings, brainstorming sessions, screenings, and salons. The Exchange is based in [[Los Angeles]], California.

==Examples==

===''Watchmen''===
In one of its first acts of business, The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange connected [[Alex McDowell]], the production designer for the 2009 film adaptation of the graphic novel ''[[Watchmen]]'', with University of Minnesota physics professor [[James Kakalios]].
&lt;ref name=aboutkaklios&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Putting the Science into 'Watchmen'
  | publisher =  MSNBC
  | year = 2009
  | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29531732/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kakalios is the author of the book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'', and was selected as a science consultant in part because of his extensive experience incorporating comic book superheroes into his writings and lectures as a way to motivate the public to take an interest in science.
&lt;ref name=sciacc&gt;{{cite web
  | title = How Scientifically Accurate is 'Watchmen'?
  | publisher =  Scientific American
  | year = 2009
  | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-accurate-is-watchmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the run up to the theatrical release of ''Watchmen,'' Kakalios and the [[University of Minnesota]] produced a short video (with more than 1,500,000 views as of April 29, 2009) explaining the science behind Dr. Manhattan's super powers to increase public awareness of the science behind the film.
&lt;ref name=sciwatchmen&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Science of Watchmen
  | publisher =  University of Minnesota
  | year = 2009
  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmj1rpzDRZ0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fringe''===
The TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' is using the Exchange to identify scientists able to address technical questions regarding scripts in development. A rapid-response team of specialists in neuroscience, epidemiology, and genetics—themes frequently featured in the series—has been gathered to assist the scriptwriters.&lt;ref name=laboutloud&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Science Goes to the Movies
  | publisher =  Lab Out Loud
  | year = 2009
  | url = http://www.laboutloud.com/episodes/2009/03/episode-28-science-goes-to-the-movies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thor ===

[[Thor (film)|Thor]] screenwriters connected through The Exchange with Kevin Hand from [[Caltech]]'s Jet Propulsion Lab, who helped them turn the comic book's mythological worlds into believable cinematic scenery.&lt;ref name="scienceandentertainmentexchange"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/article/scientist-spotlight-kevin-hand|title=Scientist Spotlight: Kevin Hand &amp;#124; The Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange|publisher=scienceandentertainmentexchange.org|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the collaboration resulted in the film featuring [[Natalie Portman]] as Jane Foster, a female physicist. This worked towards eliminating the stereotype that many hold viewing scientists strictly as men. This action also served to portray scientists in a positive, relatable manner which so many other media productions miss the mark on completely by making scientists out to be mean, evil, and cruel. This outcome illustrates a main goal of the Exchange, to use popular entertainment media to better communicate to the public about the true realities of scientists and science information in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Science as social context==
{{Tone|date=March 2012}}
Since long before [[C. P. Snow]]'s "[[Two Cultures]]" essay, science has struggled to overcome negative stereotypes; communicating science's tremendous importance and appeal to a general audience is an enormous challenge. Traditional entertainment media have portrayed scientists, over and over, as evil, mean, and cruel in the past. These ubiquitous and consonant mass media messages served to cultivate a false perception of scientists, and science in general, in the public. With movies and television shows constantly portraying scientists in this false manner it led  people to believe it was an accurate portrayal. This effect that the media can have can be described by cultivation theory. Cultivation theory was first formulated by George Gerbner in 1976.&lt;ref name="uky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/capstone/mass/cultivation.htm|title=CULTIVATION THEORY-Mass Communication Context|first=Stephanie|last=Caldwell|publisher=uky.edu|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies television (and now film) as a main source of information and storytelling in today's world. The theory of cultivation makes several assumptions which function to explain how false perceptions, such as those about science, are created. First, the theory assumes that media are controlled by a few, powerful corporate interests. Next, it believes that these players create ubiquitous and consonant messages that the lay public witnesses repeatedly. Finally, it assumes that the effects of these redundant and constant messages will occur over time to slowly cultivate false perceptions of reality in the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbener, George. Science on Television: How it Affects Public Conceptions. Issues in Science and Technology, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the cultivated beliefs about science that have formed over the past 30 years or so, science is currently not an area of interest or importance to the majority of the lay public and thus this area of research is not understood accurately by many; the majority of the public lacks basic scientific knowledge and understanding. However, the Exchange is working to effectively change this. Entertainment media that portray scientists and their work in a positive light have been found to have direct educational and socializing influences on audiences. For example, survey analyses show that some science fiction portrayals appear to boost public evaluations of science. After controlling for education and other background variables, studies find that heavier viewers of science fiction television hold greater belief in the promise of science, and are more supportive of controversial topics such as therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref name=pubeval&gt;{{cite journal

  | author = M.C. Nisbet and K. Goidel
  | publisher =  Public Understanding of Science, 16:421-440
  | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of the audience effects for the 2004 blockbuster ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', viewers of the film, after controlling for education, gender, age, and political views, were significantly more concerned about global climate change, more likely to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and more trusting of government agencies such as [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]].&lt;ref name=dayafter&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = Before and after the Day After Tomorrow: A U.S. Study of Climate Change Risk Perceptions.
  | author = A.A. Lieserowitz
  | publisher =  Environment, 46(9):23-37
  | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As news agenda-setters, film and television can also have an important indirect influence. These films provide dramatic "news pegs" for journalists seeking to either sustain or generate new coverage of an issue. For example, studies comparing the news attention sparked by the 2001 release of the Third [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|IPCC report]] on [[climate change]] with the amount of coverage generated by the 2004 release of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and the 2006 release of [[Al Gore]]'s ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', find that both films far surpassed the IPCC report in media publicity.&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Understanding the social impact of documentary film.
  | author = A.A. Lieserowitz
  | publisher =  Center for Social Media, American University.
  | year = 2004
  | url = http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/files/pdf/docs_on_a_mission.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This illustrates the great power that the entertainment media industry has in communicating with a lay audience. Science is a topic that most laymen seem to disregard, and do not show great interest or concern in. By incorporating it into a more mainstream media environment, such as television series and films versus scientific journals and newspapers, the Exchange allows scientific information and news to be communicated in an accurate and clear manner to those that would otherwise ignore the subject.

In another example, the 1998 releases of the blockbusters ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' galvanized news attention to the potential problem of [[Near Earth Object]]s, a science policy issue that otherwise rarely, if ever, receives news attention.&lt;ref name="kirby1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirby|first=David A.|author-link=David A.

Scientific verisimilitude in movies and television has been positively correlated with commercial success, providing "realism" and "legitimacy" to which audiences respond.&lt;ref name="kirby2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirby|first=David|author-link=David A.

[[File:Page from The Indian Antiquary.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover page of a 1931 edition of ''The Indian Antiquary'']]
'''''The Indian Antiquary, A journal of oriental research in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, &amp;c, &amp;c,''''' (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It was founded by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian [[folklore]]. It was succeeded by ''The New Indian Antiquary'' (1938-47) and the ''Indian Antiquary'' (1964-71).

==History==
''The Indian Antiquary'' was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India.&lt;ref name=Pros&gt;[http://indianhistorybooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/indian-antiquary-vol-i-1872.pdf Prospectus] in ''The Indian Antiquary'', Part 1, 5 January 1872, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Antiquary" in ''[[The Antiquaries Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2, April 1922, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal was a private venture,&lt;ref name=Temp&gt;[[Richard Carnac Temple|Temple, Richard Carnac]]. (1922) ''[https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofthei00temprich Fifty years of The Indian Antiquary]''. Mazgaon, Bombay: B. Miller, British India Press, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt; Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and [[Richard Carnac Temple]].&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors.&lt;ref name="Temple, p. 7"/&gt; Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] (1933, not).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; The first incarnation of the ''Antiquary'' ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933),&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://suncat.ac.uk/serials/SC00623823801/all ''Indian antiquary''.] Suncat.

The '''Thomas-Institut''' is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors.

==General information==
The Thomas-Institut was founded in 1950 by Josef Koch, then Professor for medieval philosophy at the [[University of Cologne]]. Forming part of the Faculty of Humanities and, more particularly, the [http://www.philosophie.uni-koeln.de Philosophy Department], the Thomas-Institut is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors. The director of the Institute is the professor holding the chair in [[medieval philosophy]] at the university.

Since communicating the results of this work is an essential part of the task of the Institute, the staff gives various courses in medieval philosophy at the University of Cologne. Jointly with twenty other departments - from History and Philology to Byzantine, Jewish and Islamic Studies - the Thomas-Institute organizes an extensive programme for medieval studies, the Zentrum für Mittelalterstudien ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070813081645/http://www.zfms.uni-koeln.de/ ZfMs]).

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has attached importance to international cooperation and exchange, and many of the projects pursued at the Thomas-Institut are international collaborations. The Mediaevistentagung, taking place every two years, has become one of the foremost conferences on medieval studies in Europe, furthering international and interdisciplinary research. The proceedings are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series, edited by the Institute and published by de Gruyter.

In addition to its own projects the Thomas-Institut sponsors several ongoing editions which are funded and organized by other institutions. The most important at present are the [[Averroes]] Latinus project of the International Union of Academies, funded by the Nordrhein-Westfäische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and the critical edition of the works of Nicolaus [[Cusanus]] with the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften. The Thomas-Institut likewise participates in the [[Aristoteles]] Latinus project organized by the International Union of Academies, it hosts the [[Meister Eckhart]] Archiv and has recently started the critical edition of [[Durandus of St. Pourçain]].

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has edited the Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (STGMA) published by Brill, one of the most renowned series in medieval philosophy and medieval studies. In 1997, together with the [http://www.hiw.kuleuven.be De Wulf-Mansion Centre in Leuven], the Thomas-Institut took over the journal Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales.

== Research ==

=== Main areas of expertise ===
* Conditions of Scientific Discourse in Medieval Arabic, Hebrew, Byzantine and Latin Culture

Scientific discourse in the Middle Ages has its common ground in the reception of Greek learning from late Antiquity. It is diversified, however, according to the sociological and institutional as well as religious and theological framework in which Greek science is integrated. Besides that, the processes of rationalisation taking place in various fields of knowledge exercise a considerable influence. Key-words like "Reception of [[Dionysus|Dionysius]]", "Reception of [[Aristotle]]", and "[[Averroism]]" refer us to a complex structure of medieval bodies of knowledge. This structure has to be understood as the result of far-reaching processes of reception and transformation, transmission and translation. Inquiries in this area demand a combination of philosophical, philological, and historiographical competences. Research at the Thomas-Institut focuses on the contexts of transmission, on the attempts to define the meaning of "philosophy" (for example in the relationship of "Philosophy and Wisdom"), and on the formation of [[epistemology|epistemological]] and institutional canons.

* Intellect, Mind and Soul: Concepts, Stratifications and Boundaries. A Critical Evaluation of the Medieval Debates

The debate on intellect, mind and soul is currently one of those philosophical topics generating the most innovative questions. Medieval philosophy is of central importance in this respect, since it furnishes a rich tradition of investigation in this area. The problem was dealt with in all the medieval philosophical and theological cultures and languages. While differences abounded in every milieu, some solutions were adopted across boundaries. The medieval contribution is interesting from the point of view of the history of ideas, but the reception of traditions from Antiquity also engendered new theories. The confrontation of these theories in epistemological debates from the 13th century to the Renaissance lead to the development of new models. One may think for instance of "augustinisme avicennisant", the Averroistic theory of intellect, and the combination of Aristotelian and [[pseudo-Dionysian]] noetics. When one examines the modern debate on the background just sketched, it becomes clear that medieval philosophy provides models and perspectives both richer in arguments and truly interdisciplinary. This topic has already been made the object of research by an international network of institutions working on medieval philosophy (the [http://www.egsamp.uni-koeln.de EGSAMP] members Leuven, Amsterdam, Pisa, Lecce, Bari, Sofia) in which the Thomas-Institut participates.

=== Ongoing Research Projects ===
* The Relationship between Philosophy and Wisdom
** Philosophy and Wisdom in the Middle Ages
A Contribution to the Development of the Western Concept of Philosophy
Behind the terminological opposition of philosophy and wisdom, into whose reasons this project enquires, emerges another problem: the origin of philosophy. Thus the medieval debate is representative of a basic discourse, which always anew attempts to determine the essence of philosophy. The Middle Ages, and especially the 13th century are of prime importance for the reconstruction of the affaire de cœur of philosophy and wisdom. In the second half of this century the reception of an Aristotelian idea of philosophical wisdom sparks a major controversy about the identity of philosophy, a controversy that presages many of the questions asked in the modern era. The results which have been reached in a number of case-studies will be assembled and assessed in context.

** "Rhizomatics": the Art of Living and Wisdom as Bridges for a Transcultural Philosophy 
In this project "rhizomatics" and nomadism as developed by the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari are employed to address transcultural issues. At the heart of this project are the concept of philosophy, its relation to wisdom, methodology and ethics and possible forms and constructions of philosophy. Besides the French and German Literature on Deleuze the project will take into account the reception and resonance of his ideas in Spanish-American thought.

** New Perspectives in the Historiography of Medieval Philosophy 
What is medieval philosophy? This question has been answered in a variety of ways even before Gilson's influential attempts to give a definitive reply. Such answers are always bound up with a certain idea of philosophy and its resulting mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. But if one takes into account the dynamics proper to different cultural frameworks which transferred the philosophical inheritance from late Antiquity into modernity, one must try to describe its interactions more closely, disregarding the classical narratives of medieval philosophy. In order to realise this, new methodological approaches will be attempted. This project forms part of the InterLink-project (Bari-Köln-Sofia-Leuven-Paris) "Soggetto e statuto della filosofia nel Medioevo. Nuove prospettive di ricerca nell'edizione critica dei testi e nelle metodologie di indagine storiografica".

* Thomas Aquinas in Philosophical Context
** Thomas Aquinas, In librum Beati Dionysii De divinis nominibus expositione, Book IV, Lectiones 1-10 
Thomas Aquinas's commentary on Dionysius is an exemplary case for the study of the encounter of the Latin and the Byzantine Middle Ages. Of special interest are Thomas's first ten "Lectiones" on the fourth book of his model. Here, central themes of [[Neoplatonism]] are treated: the Good, light, beauty, and love. A translation and commentary on the basis of a revised Latin text is in preparation.

** Edith Stein's Translations of Aquinas's Works De veritate and De ente et essentia 
Edith Stein's translations of Aquinas are not only an important document for the intellectual development of Husserl's former assistant but also show in an exemplary case the encounter of Neoscholasticism and modern philosophy at the beginning of the 20th century. In the framework of the new edition of the works of Edith Stein her translation of the Quaestiones disputatae de veritate and her yet unpublished translation of De ente et essential will be edited alongside a number of further "Thomistica" ([http://www.herder.de/theologie/programm/edith_stein/index_html?par_onl_struktur=704728&amp;onl_struktur=704736 ESGA 24]). 
** Thomas Aquinas, Quaestio disputata "De libero arbitrio" (De malo VI) 
This text is a key to understanding Aquinas's teaching on free choice as foundation of truly human, that is to say responsible and autonomous action. A German translation of this text on the basis of the Editio Leonina is currently in preparation and will be published, together with an extensive introduction, by Reclam.

* The Medieval Theory of Transcendentals 
The project is dedicated to the historical development of the theory of transcendentals from its formation in the thirteenth century (Philip the Chancellor) up to its treatment in the Disputationes metaphysicae by Francesco Suárez. It likewise deals with the significance of the theory of transcendentals for medieval philosophy in general.

* The "Super"-Transcendental and the Splitting of Metaphysics 
In search of the origins and motives of the splitting of metaphysics in the 17th and 18th century into a ''metaphysica generalis'' and ''metaphysica specialis'', conceived for the first time by [[Francis of Marchia]] at the beginning of the 14th century, this project enquires into the relationship between the first object of the human intellect and the proper object of metaphysics as they present themselves in conceptions of metaphysics after the time of Duns Scotus. Especially the attempt to define the primum obiectum intellectus as "super-transcendental" has a constitutive function for the legitimating of a twofold metaphysics.

* Radicalisation in lieu of Abolition of the Science of Being. On the Development of First Philosophy from the Late Middle Ages to the 18th Century 
According to the account of the development of first philosophy predominant today, this discipline underwent a transformation since the late Middle Ages, in the course of which the Aristotelian theory of being was dissolved and reformed as an onto-logic of that which can be thought, thus immediately preparing Kant's transcendental philosophy. This interpretation needs to be revised in order to show that the said transformation did not exceed the boundaries of the traditional concept of science. On the contrary, in the teachings of the main representatives of the discipline up to Wolff and Baumgarten one finds a new concept of the theory of being as a theory of the universal and necessary structure of reality which is common to God and every possible world. Thus we do not encounter abolition but rather a radicalisation of tendencies which have shaped the development of first philosophy since the medieval reception of Aristotle and his Arabic interpreters. These tendencies are: the turn from a theological to an ontological concept of first philosophy, from its conception as practical wisdom to the idea of a universal theoretical science, from transcendent being as the starting point of thought to the transcategorical and thus transcendental content of being as such.

* Master Eckhart: Historical and Systematical Perspectives 
As part of the research on the medieval theory of transcendentia, this project examines the peculiar form which the theory of transcendentals takes in Meister Eckhart. The project attempts at the same time to reconstruct Eckhart's Opus propositionum, especially the 9th tractate: "De natura superioris, et inferioris eius oppositi".

* A Mystical Treatise between Convention and Provocation - Possibilities and Limits of Expression in the "Theologia deutsch" ("The Francfurt") 
The treatise written in the 14th century which became popular in the 16th under the title Theologia deutsch, has been considered in scholarship mainly from two perspectives: on the one hand as a key text of the Reformation - it was first edited by Martin Luther - on the other hand as a document of timeless Christian spirituality that can inspire and direct even the life of modern readers. Both approaches have invested the Theologia deutsch with an aura which obfuscates its specific theologico-philosophical profile. Originally it was an anonymous treatise from the context of the so-called "German Mysticism" of the 14th century, transmitted in only a few manuscripts. This is where the planned investigation begins: Disregarding its reception during the Reformation, the Theologia deutsch is examined it its original formative context and thus as a mystical treatise of a special type, which does not at all transmit a timeless spirituality but rather - like other Latin and colloquial texts - sounds out possibilities of expression. The study centres on the Christology and the doctrine of God of the Theologia deutsch. Besides that it discusses - since according to the prologue the author was an anonymous Knight of the German Order from Francfurt - the problems of authorship, authority, and authenticity.

* [[William of Auxerre]], Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis, *[http://ti-intern.uni-koeln.de/sdoe/ First Critical Edition in Digital Format]
In the beginnings of the University of Paris around the year 1200 the Magister William of Auxerre wrote his explanation of liturgy which attempts to elucidate all the cultic-ritual actions and objects of Christian liturgy and to suggest their hidden meaning. The edition of the yet unpublished Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis makes use of the possibilities of digital data processing and further develops in this medium the methodological standards and formats of presentation established for printed editions. The edition is accompanied by a study on the concept of time which forms the basis of William's interpretation of the liturgy and according to which several levels of time and meaning become intertwined during the ritual.

* Ibn Bâjja's Kitâb al-nafs: The First Western Commentary on the De anima 
Ibn Bâjja (ob. 1139), known to the Latin scholastics as "Avempace", was - as the predecessor of Averroes - the first Spanish-Arabic philosopher to comment in a systematical manner upon the writings of Aristotle. Thus he prepared the work of "the Commentator" with respect to both method and content. This is true especially in the field of psychology and the doctrine of intellect where Ibn Bâjja, as a follower of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Alfarabi, formed an Aristotelian counterbalance to the psychology of Avicenna, which was more strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and by the medical tradition. With the preparation of the critical edition and German translation of the Kitâb al-nafs Ibn Bâjja's most central writing on psychology shall be rendered accessible in a reliable form supplemented with guides to its sources. The edition will be accompanied by a study which - for the first time - examines in detail the philosophical questions and solutions of this early period of the reception of De anima. It enquires into the conceptual and historical background of problems like the concept of intention (ma'nâ) or the so-called "conjunction with the Active Intellect" - ideas which came to exercise a longstanding and varied influence.

* "The Birth of a World". Investigations into Themes in the Thought of Michel Foucault 
Starting from an analysis of the opposition of truth and fiction dictated by the traditional idea of philosophy and science, and an examination of the concomitant confrontation of philosophy and science on the one hand and literature on the other hand this study investigates the peculiar status which Michel Foucault gives to the concept of knowledge. This concept of knowledge corresponds in Foucault's writings to a specific concept of fiction in a way that has yet to be clearly defined. To this end Foucault's early texts (apparently dismissed by him later), the long Binswanger-introduction (1954), and the Archéologie du savoir are all searched for a motif which can be called - employing an expression by Foucault himself - the "Birth of a World". The investigation into this theme renders visible elements of "structure" and "history". In the course of this reading the evolution of the foundational thought-structures leading to Foucault's specific concept of knowledge will be examined.

=== Edition Projects ===
* The Commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (a S. Porciano) 
As J. Koch has shown, the commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (1275–1334) is preserved in three recensions. While the last redaction was printed in the 16th century, the first two versions remain unpublished. Of particular interest is the first, because it contains the sharpest polemic against Thomas Aquinas and because it engendered the most critical response by his contemporaries (such as Petrus de Palude and Petrus Aureoli). In the first place a computerised copy of the third version will be made, which can serve as an effective research instrument. The project centres, nevertheless, on the critical edition of the first version which will be made on the basis of a complete collation of all manuscripts.

* Critical Edition of the Commentaries on Book V and VI of the Nicomachean Ethics in the Latin Translation by Robert Grosseteste 
The project consists in the study of the Latin reception of the commentaries on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics composed and assembled in twelfth century Constantinople at the initiative of Princess Anna Comnena. The critical edition of the texts of the commentaries on book V (Anonymous and [[Michael of Ephesus]]) and book VI ([[Eustratius of Nicaea]]) will complete Mercken's edition of the commentaries on books I-IV (CLCAG 6.1) and VII-X (CLCAG 6.3). The edition of the text will be introduced by a study of the sources of the Greek original text and its Latin reception in the thirteenth and fourteenth century.

* Averroes: Collected Works 
The Latin translation of three of the most important works of Averroes, the Long Commentaries on De caelo, Physica, and Metaphysica, will be edited and published in the series "Bibliotheca" affiliated with the Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales. This "editio minor" is based on the early printings and some few manuscripts. It is further intended to make these commentaries eventually available on CD-Rom. The edition of the Long Commentary on De caelo on the basis of F. Carmody's edition, revised by R. Arnzen, has already been published. At the moment the edition of the Long Commentary on the Metaphysica (by Dag N. Hasse, Würzburg) and of the Long Commentary on the Physica are in preparation.

=== Collaborations ===
* Historical-Critical Edition of the Arabic-Latin Translations of Averroes's (Ibn Rushd's) Commentaries on Aristotle 
This project forms part of the edition of the Opera omnia, supervised by the International Union of Academies (Director: Gerhard Endress; responsible for the Averroes Latinus: Andreas Speer). It is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

** Middle Commentary on the Categoriae 
This Middle Commentary on the Categoriae forms part of the group of Middle Commentaries which Averroes devoted to the Organon and whose Latin translation is attributed to William of Luna. Prepared by a large number of publications, the work currently in progress continues the edition of the Middle Commentary on Peri Hermeneias which has already been published. At the moment the text is prepared for printing, the apparatus and the Latin-Arabic glossary are being adapted to the definite text. At the same time some parts of the introduction are developed further; for example, the question whether there were any double translations is examined, as is the Hebrew-Latin translation from the Renaissance. Did its author, Jacob Mantino, make use of the medieval Arabic-Latin translation or its editio princeps?

** Long Commentary on the Physica 
Averroes completed his Long Commentary on the Physics around the year 1186. Like a number of other works by Averroes, it was translated from Arabic to Latin at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably by Michael Scot. More than sixty medieval manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, preserve the versio vulgata of the text. The detailed documentation of its textual history evolves continually. With the exception of a few manuscripts the dependences and interrelations in the manuscript tradition have been established on the basis of a comparison of approximately 1100 positions. The results concerning the filiation of the manuscripts can thus be established.

** Long Commentary on the Physica, Book VII, according to Ms. Vienna, Austrian National Library, Lat. 2334 
In the manuscript of the Austrian National Library, Vienna lat. 2334, the seventh and part of the eight book of the Long Commentary are preserved in a translation which differs considerably from the one by Michel Scot, both in vocabulary and in syntax. This text will be edited separately. In order to prove that the translator was not Michel Scot, but probably Hermannus Alemannus, this edition will be accompanied by a detailed comparison of technical terms and of important portions of the text. The study has been approved by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie and will be published by F. Schöningh, Paderborn ({{ISBN|978-3-506-76316-7}})

** Arabic Concepts of Metaphysics, Considering in particular Averroes's Epitome on Aristotle's Metaphysics 
The project comprises two parts: First, a historical-critical edition of the Arabic text of Averroes's Epitome on the Metaphysics which is based on all available Arabic manuscripts and which takes into account the Hebrew translation from the 13th century, as well as the Latin translation from the 16th based on the latter. The edition will be introduced by a philological study and accompanied by an English translation, in order to render the text available for a larger group of scholars in medieval philosophy. The second part consists in a historical and philosophical analysis of Arabic concepts of metaphysics, its foundations, objects, parts, and methods. Averroes's concept of metaphysics will be investigated in the historical and philosophical context of competing ideas. Of special interest is the question whether in the post-Avicennian tradition metaphysics was conceived as ontology and/or universal science in contradistinction from theology.

** Averroes-Database 
The bibliography of secondary literature on Averroes published since 1980 contains at present 1043 titles. It is constantly updated and accessible via internet. The bibliography of Averroes's works provides information on the relevant manuscripts, editions, and translations. It is still in preparation, but the sections on Logic, Philosophy of Nature, Psychology and the Doctrine of Intellect are already [online http://www.thomasinst.uni-koeln.de/averroes].

* Historical-Critical Edition of Aristotle's Meteorology in the Latin Translation by William of Moerbeke 
This project is part of the Aristoteles Latinus, edited by the International Union of Academies and directed by Carlos Steel. The Latin text of the Meteorology has already been published on the CD-ROM version of the Aristoteles Latinus (Édition CD-ROM des traductions gréco-latines d'Aristote) in 2003.

* Historical-Critical Edition of Book I and II of the Commentary on the Physics by Aegidius Romanus 
The Augustinian monk Aegidius Romanus (ca. 1243/7-1316) was a prominent figure at the University of Paris in the late 13th century. His philosophical works consist mainly in commentaries on Aristotle. In the late 13th and during the 14th century Aegidius's commentaries were well known; their impact can be compared with the paraphrases by Albert the Great and the commentaries by Thomas Aquinas. This project centres on the edition of book I and II of his commentary on the Physics (ca. 1274/75). They are devoted to some central issues in Aristotle's philosophy of nature, namely the problems of the principles of change, the concept of nature, and the concepts of necessity and chance. Aegidius's commentary is extant in thirty manuscripts. The manuscript tradition is complex because it is partly a University tradition, dependent on one exemplar from the university milieu, and partly independent. The text of books I and II has been established on the basis of eight manuscripts, and the sources have been traced. At present the historical and philological introduction is in preparation. The edition will be part of Aegidii Romani Opera omnia, edited by the Unione Accademica Nazionale, directed by Francesco Del Punta.

== History ==
The foundation of the Thomas-Institut on October 10, 1950, grew out of efforts to reinstall a centre for the study of medieval philosophy in Germany after World War II, one that would be able to inspire research into a philosophical tradition representing positive ideas and humanistic values. It was hoped that the discussion of the problems of our time would benefit from the results of such studies. Nevertheless, the Thomas-Institut was not conceived as part of the movement of [[Neo-Scholasticism]], but rather as an institution which would conduct research in medieval philosophy much in the same way that elsewhere research in ancient and modern philosophy was done - never as a narrowly historical enterprise, but always in touch with contemporary questions and perspectives.

Josef Koch (1885–1967), then one of the rare German scholars internationally renowned in the field of medieval philosophy, had been chosen in 1948 to become a professor at the University of Cologne with a view to the Institute's founding. In close connection with the founding of the Institute stood the creation of the Mediaevistentagung, and the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, both of which were devised by Koch and are still carried on today.

The development of the Institute was boosted by a grant from the American High Commissioner for Germany, arranged by Professor John O. Riedl of the Educational and Cultural Relation Division, and later of Marquette University in Milwaukee - a personal friend of founder Josef Koch. The Institute was able to move into three rooms in Universitätsstraße 22, where later it was allowed to expand considerably, and where it is still housed today. Since 1952 the Thomas-Institut has been maintained by the University of Cologne and has become an integral part of the Philosophy Department.

The first tasks of the newly created Institute consisted in building up a research library and in procuring the necessary microfilm copies of medieval manuscripts in order to render critical editions possible. The collection concentrated at first on [[Meister Eckhart]] and Nicolaus [[Cusanus]], who were then studied by Koch and editions of whose works were prepared at the Institute in continuation of projects begun before the war. The fund of manuscript copies grew steadily and was enriched by every new project. The library was designed to include not only primary texts from the Middle Ages and bibliographical material but a historical section spanning from Antiquity to contemporary philosophy that permits the systematic studies intended by the aims described in 1950.

In 1954 Koch was succeeded in the director's office by Paul Wilpert (1906–1967), an expert in [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and already affiliated with the [[Cusanus]] edition since the 1940s. It was Wilpert who created the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series in 1962, thus providing an organ for the publications of the Institute, first and foremost the proceedings of the Mediaevistentagungen. In 1961 Wilpert organized in Cologne the 2nd International Congress of Medieval Philosophy of the Société internationale pour l'Étude de la Philosophie Médiévale ([[S.I.E.P.M]]), whose vice chairman he had become in the founding year of the organization, 1958. With the activities of Wilpert's collaborator, Gudrun Vuillemin-Diem, the Thomas-Institut took part in the Aristoteles Latinus project of the International Union of Academies. Ms. Vuillemin-Diem has continued working with the Thomas-Institut under its subsequent directors, and has published to date the four medieval recensions of the Metaphysics.

After Wilpert's sudden death, Albert Zimmermann (1928–2017), a pupil of Josef Koch's, became the third director of the Thomas-Institut. His fields of research are especially the Aristotelian philosophy of nature in the Middle Ages and Latin Averroism. When the International Union of Academies took over the Averrois Opera project from the Medieval Academy of America, Zimmermann became its general editor in 1974 (until 1996) and the Thomas-Institut took the responsibility for the edition of the Latin translations of Averroes's commentaries. The project currently employs two editors, Roland Hissette and Horst Schmieja, and is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften. In 1992 Zimmermann was elected president of the [[S.I.E.P.M]].

Zimmermann retired in 1993 and was followed in office in 1994 by Jan Adrianus Aertsen, formerly a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (since 1984).  His main area of research is the history of the Doctrine of Transcendentals.  In 1997 Aertsen was elected vice chairman of the [[S.I.E.P.M]]. The 4th Symposium Averroicum, combined with the sixth conference of the editors of Averroes's works, was held in Cologne in 1996 in collaboration with Gerhard Endreß (Bochum). In 1997 the Thomas-Institut under the lead of Jan A. Aertsen and Andreas Speer organized the 10th International Congress of Medieval Philosophy in Erfurt. Following a suggestion by Jan A. Aertsen and a conference in Cologne co-organized by the Thomas-Institut, a Gesellschaft für Philosophie des Mittelalters und der Renaissance ([http://www.gpmr.uni-koeln.de GPMR]) was set up in 2003, for which the Thomas-Institut currently provides the office.

The present director of the Thomas-Institut, [http://www.thomasinstitut.uni-koeln.de/mitarbeiter/speer/ Andreas Speer], formerly professor at Würzburg (2000), was appointed in 2004.

== Activities ==

=== Mediaevistentagung ===
Already on October 11, 1950, one day after the foundation of the Thomas-Institut, the first [http://www.kmt.uni-koeln.de Mediaevistentagung] took place. Josef Koch had invited scholars from Germany and from the Institut supérieur de philosophie of Louvain with the declared aim to assemble - not for a "congress" but in "friendly discussion" - all those interested in medieval studies: philosophers, theologians, historians, philologists, art- and music-historians. This interdisciplinary approach has since determined the programmes of the Mediaevistentagungen, which until 1960 were held every year. Since 1960 the Thomas-Institut organizes those conferences every two years in the second week of September.
Beginning with the second conference in 1951, which was devoted to medieval symbolism, every Mediaevistentagung has been centred on a global topic that stood in relation with the work done at the Institute or with current interests in the field of medieval studies. Since 1952, the results have been documented; the first proceedings were published in the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (vols. 3 and 5), since 1956 they are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series created especially for that purpose.
While remaining true to its original concept, the Mediaevistentagung has become more fully international, bigger - the record was set with circa 300 participants in 1994 - and, not to mention, longer - it now lasts a week. In 2004 a workshop was introduced to precede the main conference. It provides a forum for younger scholars to present their works in progress or, alternatively, presents an opportunity to share different approaches and projects in open discussion.

=== Forschungskolloquium ===

The "Forschungskolloquium" is a series of loosely connected lectures by our collaborators, guests, or invitees. It affords an opportunity to present a particular field of research to the colleagues and at the same time to the wider public.

=== Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium ===
The "Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium", organized together with the Philosophy Department of [[Bonn University]], is a semester long reading course for graduate and older undergraduate students (taking place every two weeks). The course examines a systematic topic (e.g. Aristotelian psychology, concepts of metaphysics) throughout ancient and medieval philosophy.

{{for|the architectural movement|Traditionalist School (architecture)}}

The '''Traditionalist School''' is a group of 20th- and 21st-century thinkers concerned with what they consider to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]]. Other important thinkers in this tradition include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Jean Borella]], and [[Julius Evola]]. A central belief of this school is the existence of a perennial wisdom, or [[perennial philosophy]], which says that there are primordial and universal truths which form the source for, and are shared by all the major world religions.

==Ideas==
According to the Traditionalists, there are primordial and universal religious truths which are at the foundations of all major world religions. The Traditionalists speak of "absolute Truth and infinite Presence".{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Absolute Truth is "the perennial wisdom (''sophia perennis'') that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} According to Traditionalists, "the primordial and perennial truth" is manifested in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} Infinite Presence is "the perennial religion (''religio perennis'') that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|The term ''philosophia perennis'', which has been current since the time of the Renaissance and of which neo-scholasticism made much use, signifies the totality of the primordial and universal truths — and therefore of the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] axioms — whose formulation does not belong to any particular system. One could speak in the same sense of a religio perennis, designating by this term the essence of every religion; this means the essence of every form of worship, every form of prayer, and every system of morality, just as the sophia perennis is the essence of all dogmas and all expressions of wisdom.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}} 

Although the Traditionalist school is often said to be a "perennial philosophy", its members prefer the term ''sophia perennis'' ("perennial wisdom").{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|We prefer the term sophia to that of philosophia, for the simple reason that the second term is less direct and because it evokes in addition associations of ideas with a completely profane and all too often aberrant system of thought.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}}

The Traditionalist vision of a perennial wisdom is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions.{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}}{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010|p=vii}} It is "intuited directly through divine intellect."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} This divine intellect is different from reason, and makes it possible to discern "the sacred unity of reality that is attested in all authentic esoteric expressions of tradition";{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} it is "the presence of divinity within each human waiting to be uncovered."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|The key to the eternal sophia is pure intellection or in other words metaphysical discernment. To "discern" is to "separate": to separate the Real and the illusory, the Absolute and the contingent, the Necessary and the possible, Atma and Maya. Accompanying discernment, by way of complement and operatively, is concentration, which unites: this means becoming fully aware — from the starting point of earthly and human Maya — of Atma, which is both absolute and infinite.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}}

Traditionalists discern a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or Absolute, c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional "mystical concentration on the Real".{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xiii}} 

According to the Traditionalists, this truth has been lost in the modern world through the rise of novel secular philosophies stemming from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J Schwindt, [https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Modern-World-Traditionalist/dp/153282534X/ The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and modernity itself is considered as an "anomaly in the history of mankind."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} Traditionalists see their approach as a justifiable "nostalgia for the past".{{sfn|Schuon|1982|p=8}}{{refn|group=note|Guénon rejected the term, because "it implies in his view a kind of sentimental attachment to a tradition which, most of the time, has lost its metaphysical foundation.&lt;ref group=web name="fabbriintro"&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Fabbri/Perennialism.pdf An Introduction to the Perennialist School].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="SaintAidan"&gt;[http://www.saintaidan.ca/2011/04/problem-with-isms.html Saint Aidan Orthodox Church, ''The Problem with "isms"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|... "traditionalism"; like "esoterism" [...] has nothing pejorative about it in itself [...] If to recognize what is true and just is "nostalgia for the past," it is quite clearly a crime or a disgrace not to feel this nostalgia.{{sfn|Schuon|1982|p=8}}}}

Traditionalists insist on the necessity for affiliation to one of the "normal traditions", or great ancient religions of the world.{{refn|group=note|See Titus Burckhardt, "A Letter on Spiritual Method" in ''Mirror of the Intellect'', Cambridge (UK), Quinta Essentia, 1987 ({{ISBN|0-946621-08-X}}), where a rather strict list is given.}} The regular affiliation to the ordinary life of a believer is crucial, since this could give access to the [[Western esotericism|esoterism]] of that given religious form.{{sfn|Guénon|2001|p=48}}

==People==
The ideas of the Traditionalist School are considered to begin with [[René Guénon]]. Other people considered Traditionalists include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Jean Borella]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Dragoš Kalajić]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Frithjof Schuon]] and [[Julius Evola]].{{refn|group=note|Renaud Fabbri argues that Evola should not be considered a member of the Perennialist School. See the section ''Julius Evola and the Perennialist School'' in Fabbri's [http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Fabbri/Perennialism.pdf Introduction to the Perennialist School].}}

===René Guénon===
A major theme in the works of René Guénon (1886-1951) is the contrast between traditional world views and modernity, "which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} For Guénon, the physical world was a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} For Guénon, "the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}}{{refn|group=note|According to Wouter Hanegraaf, "modernity itself is in fact intertwined with the history of esotericism."{{sfn|Sedgwick|2004|p=13}} Western esotericism had a profound influence on Hindu and Buddhist modernisers, whose modernisations in turn had a deep impact on modern western [[spirituality]]. See:&lt;br/&gt;*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Michelis|first=Elizabeth De|title=A History of Modern Yoga: Patanjali and Western Esotericism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HTUAwAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-8772-8}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharf|first1=Robert|title=Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience|journal=NUMEN|date=1 January 1995|volume=42|url=http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sharf/documents/Sharf1995,%20Buddhist%20Modernism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =De Michelis | first =Elizabeth | year =2005 | title =A History of Modern Yoga | publisher =Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=McMahan|first=David L.|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU6HNwlxhCAC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early on, Guénon was attracted to [[Sufism]], which he saw as a more accessible path of spiritual knowledge. In 1912 Guénon was initiated in the [[Shadhili]] order. He started writing after his doctoral dissertation was rejected, and he left academia in 1923.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} His works center on the return to these traditional world views,{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} trying to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy.&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW" /&gt;

In his first books and essays he envisaged a restoration of traditional "''intellectualité''" in the West on the basis of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Freemasonry]].{{refn|group=note|Cf. among others his ''Aperçus sur l'ésotérisme chrétien'' (Éditions Traditionnelles, Paris, 1954) and ''Études sur la Franc-maçonnerie et le Compagnonnage'' (2 vols, Éditions Traditionnelles, Paris, 1964-65) which include many of his articles for the Catholic journal ''Regnabit''.}} He gave up early on a purely Christian basis for a traditionalist restoration of the West, searching for other traditions. He denounced the lure of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-occultism in the form of [[Spiritism]],{{refn|group=note|Cf. his ''Le Théosophisme, histoire d'une pseudo-religion'', Paris, Nouvelle Librairie Nationale, 1921, and ''L'Erreur spirite'', Paris, Marcel Rivière, 1923. Both books exist in English translation.}} two influential movements that were flourishing in his lifetime.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1930 he moved to Egypt, where he lived until his death in 1951.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}}

==Influence==
Traditionalism had a discrete impact in the field of [[comparative religion]],&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW"&gt;[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/against-the-modern-world-9780195396010?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;# Oxford University Press, ''Description: "Against the Modern World. Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century"'']&lt;/ref&gt; particularly on the young [[Mircea Eliade]], although he was not himself a member of this school. Contemporary scholars such as [[Huston Smith]], [[William Chittick]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], [[James Cutsinger]] and Hossein Nasr have advocated Perennialism as an alternative to secularist approach to religious phenomena.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Through the close affiliation with Sufism, the traditionalist perspective has been gaining ground in Asia and the Islamic world at large.{{refn|group=note|Witness the works by Mahmoud Bina at the Isfahan University of Technology, the Malay scholar Osman Bakar, and the Ceylonese Ranjit Fernando. This is probably also related to the expansion of the [[Shadhili#Maryamiyya|Maryamiyya]] branch of the [[Shadhili|Shadhili Sufi order]], as studied by Sedgwick, ''Against the Modern World'', always within the pale of [[Sunni Islam]]. Cf. also a review by [[Carl W. Ernst]]: [http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/Traditionalism.htm "Traditionalism, the Perennial Philosophy, and Islamic Studies]," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin'', vol. 28, no. 2 (December 1994), pp. 176-81.}}

==Association with far right movements==
The Traditionalist School has been associated with some far right movements. Critics of Traditionalism cite its popularity among the European ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' ("New Right"),{{sfn|Davies|Lynch|2004|p=322}} while [[Julius Evola]]'s ideas were used by [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] during the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]. [[Mark Sedgwick]]'s ''Against the Modern World'', published in 2004, gives an analysis of the Traditionalist School and its influence.
{{quote|A number of disenchanted intellectuals responded to Guénon's call with attempts to put theory into practice. Some attempted without success to guide Fascism and Nazism along Traditionalist lines; others later participated in political terror in Italy. Traditionalism finally provided the ideological cement for the alliance of anti-democratic forces in post-Soviet Russia, and at the end of the Twentieth Century began to enter the debate in the Islamic world about the desirable relationship between Islam and modernity.&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW" /&gt;}}

In his book ''Guénon ou le renversement des clartés'', the French scholar [[Xavier Accart]] questions the connection sometimes made between the Traditionalist School and [[far-right politics]]. According to Accart, René Guenon was highly critical of Evola's political involvements and was worried about the possible confusion between his own ideas and Evola's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Accart finally claims that the assimilation of Guénon with Evola and the confusion between Traditionalism and the [[New Right]] can be traced back to [[Louis Pauwels]] and Bergier's ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1960).{{sfn|Accart|2005}}

[[Alain de Benoist]], the founder of the Nouvelle Droite declared in 2013 that the influence of Guénon on his political school was very weak and that he does not consider him as a major author.{{refn|group=note|On [[Radio Courtoisie]] (20 May 2013), during the programme ''Le Libre Journal de la resistance française'' presented by Emmanuel Ratier and Pascal Lassalle.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17429">'''Vogel's Tonnetz''' is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of [[just intonation]], introduced by German music theorist [[Martin Vogel]] 1976 in his book ''Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen'' (english: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). 
The graphical representation is based on [[Tonnetz|Euler's Tonnetz]], adding a third dimension for just [[Harmonic seventh|sevenths]] to the two dimensions for just [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and just [[Major third|thirds]]. 
It serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.
The four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the [[#Consonance and the congruency of harmonics|congruency of harmonics]] of chords depending on the tonal material. 
It can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.

== The graphical representation ==

The graphical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is limited to the three dimensions for fifths, thirds, and seventh. In this representation tones separated by one or several octaves are depicted on the same nodes. The illustration shows the chord which is the most frequent 4-note chord in western music: the major seventh. In Euler's Tonnetz the B-flat is constructed from fifths and thirds. In Vogel's Tonnetz it is given as a just harmonic seventh.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The representation of this chord in Vogel's three-dimensional Tonnetz makes its statistical dominance much more plausible than its representation in Euler's two-dimensional Tonnetz: There is a distinct reference note (C), and all other notes are linked to this reference note via simple one-step intervals in this Tonnetz.

== The mathematical representation ==

The mathematical representation of Vogel's Tonnetz is four-dimensional, considering also [[octave]]s.
Each tone is represented by a [[4-tuple|quadruple]] of numbers specifying how many octaves, "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" are needed to reach that tone in the Tonnetz (where the terms "fifths", "thirds", and "seventh" denote the prime numbers 3, 5, and 7, instead of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 und 7/4).
The C-major seventh chord with the notes c', e', g', and b-flat' could (with reference to C)be represented by the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
This corresponds to the quadruple (2,0,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (1,1,0,0), and (0,0,0,1).
The quadruple notations represents the [[prime decomposition]] of the numbers that are needed to describe the chord, limited to the first four prime numbers.

Vogel adopts the harmonic dualism of [[Arthur von Oettingen]], with [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor]] chords being mirror images of each other. This view is complemented by a quantitative computation of [[consonance]] (or rather [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]) values.

[[File:Chords with reference notes.jpg|thumb|C major and C minor chord with upper and lower reference tone]]

For this purpose Vogel introduces virtual reference tones that are not necessarily part of the chord. These reference tones are chosen such that all chord tones have integer relations to these reference tones. For each chord there exists a lower and an upper reference tone, with all chord tones being integer multiples of the frequency of the lower reference tone and integer fractions of the frequency of the upper reference tone. In quadruple notation there are only positive (or zero) values if the chord is related to the lower reference tone, and only negative (or zero) values if the chord is related to the higher reference tone.

To get a single numerical value describing the complexity of a chord, Vogel builds a weighted sum of the quadruples describing the notes of the chord. He suggests the weights 1, 3, 5, and 7 for the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Vogel rejects the more obvious variant where prime number 2 is weighted with 2 because it leads to results that in his opinion do not comply with the perception of musically skilled listeners. Finally, the weighted sum is divided by the number of tones of the chord. This computation is done for both the higher and the lower reference tone. Depending on which of those two values is smaller, the chord is then labeled as "Oberklang" or "Unterklang" ("upper chord", if reference to the lower reference note, or "lower chord", if referenced to the upper reference note).

The C major chord c’-e’-g’ could, for instance, be referenced to C.
All three notes of the triad can be represented as integer multiples of the frequency of this reference tone (4, 5, and 6). 
The prime decomposition yields 2&amp;#x00B7;2,5,2&amp;#x00B7;3. 
Applying the weights suggested by Vogel one obtains a so-called consonance value of (1+1+5+1+3)/3 = 11/3 = 3.67. 
The same chord may also be referenced to b’’’’: this upper reference tone has 15 times the frequency of c’, 12 times the frequency of e’ and ten times the frequency of g’. 
The prime decomposition yields3&amp;#x00B7;5,2&amp;#x00B7;2&amp;#x00B7;3,2&amp;#x00B7;5.
The consonance value computes to (3+5+1+1+3+1+5)/3 = 19/3 = 6,33. 
As the consonance value for the lower reference tone is better (smaller), the c major chord c’-e’-g’ is defined to be an upper chord referenced to C.
The consonance value of the c minor chord c’-es’-g’ is identical.
It is, however, reference to the upper reference tone of this chord, g’’’.
In consequence, Vogel rejects the naming of this chord as C minor as its reference note is not C but G. He calls it "G lower chord".

Vogel suggests a specific notation for upper and lower chords.
The notation starts by denoting the reference tone in lower case.
Upper chords are marked by an "O" (Oberklang) and are denoted from left to right, lower chords are marked by a "U" (Unterklang) and are denoted from right to left.
The C major chord is denoted as cO, the C minor chord is denoted as Ug.
Additional symbols for additional notes (7 for adding an upper or lower seventh) are added to the left or to the right, depending on whether it is an upper or a lower chord. 
The C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord depicted above would be denoted as cO7.

In addition to the calculation of consonance values for single chords, 
Vogel suggests a computation of the consonance of chord transitions.
When transiting from an n-note chord to an m-note chord all N&amp;#x00B7;M note-to-note transitions are evaluated via prime decomposition and weighted sum, and a mean value for all these transitions is computed.
Vogel also suggest to compute a consonance value for an entire piece of music, taking into account a central reference point similar to a [[Gregorian mode|final]].

=== Consonance and the congruency of harmonics ===

The consonance value calculated with Vogel's formula should rather be termed dissonance value, because with increasing dissonance of a chord or interval its value increases.
Vogel did not claim to predict consonance judgments of today's listeners.
A close relation of Vogel's consonance values with consonance judgments is in deed not to be expected.
Firstly, consonance judgments correlate strongly with familiarity judgments.&lt;ref name="Karas"&gt;Agnieszka Karas, Christian Kaernbach: ''Putting Martin Vogel to test: An attempt to evaluate a musical theory.'' In U. Ansorge et al. (Hrsg.): ''Beiträge zur [https://www.teap.de/docs/teap2013_final_programme_updated.pdf 55. Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psychologen.]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF; 11,3&amp;nbsp;MB)'' Pabst Science Publishers, Lengerich, 2013, S. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, major and minor are attributed emotional values by today's Western listeners (minor being perceived as expressing sadness).
Thirdly, his formula considers only the congruency of harmonics, but not the congruency of [[combination tone]]s.
It would be more cautious to say that Vogel's formula correlates with the congruency of harmonics, expressing in how far the harmonics of a chord fit together or not.

The range of the validity of the formula is in addition limited by the limits of hearing.
A just octave cannot be discriminated from an octave that is mistuned by a [[schisma]] (a mistuning of about 2 [[cent (music)|cent]]). The perceptual limit for the frequency difference of complex tones is about 0.25 % (4 cent).&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"&gt;Christian Kaernbach, Christian Bering: ''Exploring the temporal mechanism involved in the pitch of unresolved harmonics.'' In: ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.'' Vol. 110, 2001, S. 1039-1048 ([http://www.emotion.uni-kiel.de/fileadmin/emotion/team/kaernbach/publications/2001_kae_ber_jasa.pdf PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogel's consonance formula yields a consonance value of (1&amp;#x00B7;1+0&amp;#x00B7;3+0&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 0.5 for the just octave (1,0,0,0), and a values of (14&amp;#x00B7;1+8&amp;#x00B7;3+1&amp;#x00B7;5+0&amp;#x00B7;7)/2 = 43/2 = 21.5 for the octave mistuned by a schisma (-14,8,1,0).

=== Consequences for the selection of tones ===
[[File:C minor chord with high and low third.jpg|thumb|C minor chord with high and low third [[File:C minor chord with third high and low.ogg|noicon|40px]]]]

Vogel's consonance formula can help to decide, which tones of the Tonnetz should be taken for a certain chord. The consonance value of the seventh chord in Euler's Tonnetz (see figure above) is 8.5. In Vogel's Tonnetz one could select the same tones, resulting in the same consonance value. If one, however, decides to select the just seventh, the consonance value improves to 4.5. Hence, according to Vogel, the seventh chord using a just seventh is to be preferred over a seventh chord where the seventh is built from fifth and thirds.

=== Compositional consequences ===

Vogel claims that his formula entails also compositional consequences.
If one wants a chord to be consonant, major chords should be composed such that thirds and sevenths are set in a high register.
Minor chords, however, would have to be set the other way round, with thirds and sevenths being set in a low register.
This is by no means compatible with the compositional practice of the last centuries (with perhaps the exception of the Tristan chord, see below).
In consequence, minor chords set along Vogel's composition rules sound unfamiliar.
They exhibit, however, a better congruency of harmonics than their classical variants.
The left-hand of the two C minor chords in the adjoining figure is composed in the classical way, with the third being set in a high register. The consonance value for this chord is 4.33.
The right-hand minor chord features a low third. It sounds unfamiliar. Its consonance value is, however, much lower (3.0), and the congruency of its harmonics is much better.

== Limiting the theory to the prime numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7 ==

Vogel considers the theoretically infinite four-dimensional space of tones of his Tonnetz as complete; no further dimensions are needed for higher prime numbers.
According to his theory, consonance results from the congruency of [[harmonics]]. The prime number 11 and any other higher prime number can not lead to any perception of congruency, as the [[inner ear]] separates only the first eight to ten partials.&lt;ref name="Kaernbach"/&gt; The eleventh partial may be audible and discriminable from the tenth or twelfth partial if isolated via techniques such as [[Harmonic#Harmonics_on_stringed_instruments|flageolet]]. If presented as part of a complex tone comprising also the adjoining partials these partials would fuse together, and a congruency with the partial of another note could no longer be detected. It might be interesting to test whether it is possible to detect harmonic congruency for higher prime numbers for instruments with odd partials, as the distances between partials are higher in these instruments. With training it might be possible to detect consonance up to prime number 17 or even 19.

== The half-diminished seventh chord in Vogel's Tonnetz ==

[[File:Tristanvorspiel.jpg|thumb|400px|Beginning of the Prelude of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan and Isolde, with the Tristan chord (yellow) and its resolution (blue) [[File:Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|noicon|40px]] ]]
[[File:Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz.gif|framed|The Tristan chord(yellow) and its resolution (blue) in Vogel's Tonnetz, animated]]

The [[Tristan chord]] is a historically important chord in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''Tristan and Isolde''. Its role in [[Diatonic function|functional harmony]] cannot clearly be determined. It is considered to be tonally unsettled and extremely chromatic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kurth (Musikwissenschaftler)|Ernst Kurth:]] ''Romantische Harmonik und ihre Krise in Wagners „Tristan“'', Bern 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vogel's Tonnetz this chord appears to be the dual counterpiece of a major seventh chord. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that this G-sharp minor chord with an added lower seventh (E-sharp or F is a seventh below the reference of this G-sharp minor chord, the D-sharp) resolves in a E major chord with an added upper seventh (see also the adjoining animated figure). In addition, Wagner's way to set this chord is compatible with this view, with the third (B) and the seventh (F or E-sharp) set in a low register. In Vogel's notation one would note this chord as 7Ud{{music|#}}, as the reference note of the G-sharp minor chord is the D-sharp.

It is not very likely that Vogel's notation for minor chords will win recognition. It would require that a C minor chord is denoted as Ug, as lower chord under g. A compromise notation could be to denote the Tristan chord as G{{music|#}}m/F, i.e., as a G-sharp minor chord with an F in the bass.

The "explanation" of the Tristan chord in Vogel's Tonnetz as a well-composed counter-piece of a major seventh chord cannot be compared to an "explanation" in the scope of functional harmony. Both types of explanations cannot really explain why certain chords and chord sequences have established themselves in musical history. Functional harmony focuses on the relation of a chord to the prevailing tonality. In consequence, it cannot explain chord progressions found in late-romantic music where there is no longer a continuous tonality present. In contrast, Vogel's theory focuses more on the congruency of the notes of a single chord, or with the notes of the preceding or subsequent chord than on the role of this chord in the context of a prevailing tonality. Vogel's analysis reveals that the Tristan chord is by no means an attack on the tonal system as such but that it is part of it exactly as its counterpart, the major seventh chord.

A similar chord is also often used by jazz musicians.
There it is commonly notated as a half-diminished seventh chord.
The Tristan chord could hence be noted as Fm&lt;sup&gt;7 b5&lt;/sup&gt;).
This way to describe this chord misses its relation to a G-sharp minor chord.
It results from the practice to describe chords starting from their lowest note.
According to Vogel this is appropriate for upper chords, but not for lower chords.
Lower chords should be described top-down instead of bottom-up.
The principle of starting with the lowest note is not consequently observed in other situations, such as with [[Inverted chord|inverted chords]].
A C major chord in its [[first inversion]] is not typically described as an E minor chord with altered fifth (Em&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Reception ==

Vogel's Tonnetz resorts on a theory (Euler's Tonnetz) that is more than 100 years older than the presently dominating functional harmony.
Vogel's Tonnetz and functional harmony are not in conflict with each other.
On the contrary, they can be seen as complementing each other:
While Vogel's theory focuses on local relations of tones and chords, 
functional harmony considers the global role of a chord in the context of the entire piece of music.
However, the prevalence of functional harmony and the peculiarities of Vogel's notation hamper the general reception.
Vogel's consonance formula has only recently been tested empirically.&lt;ref name="Karas" /&gt; 
Kaernbach suggests a simplified notation:
writing always from left to right, using capital letters for the reference tones (avoiding confusions with the convention to use lowercase letters for minor chords), and using a triangular symbol (&amp;#9650; und &amp;#9660;) to denote upper and lower chords. 
The beginning of the prelude of Tristan and Isolde could then be denoted as 
D&amp;#9660;{{music|#}}7 → E&amp;#9650;7.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kaernbach: ''Honoring Martin Vogel – Champion of just intonation in music.'' In U. Ansorge et al.

'''Women's studies''' is an academic field that draws on [[Feminism|feminist]] and interdisciplinary methods in order to place women’s lives and experiences at the center of study, while examining [[Social constructionism|social and cultural constructs]] of [[gender]]; systems of privilege and oppression; and the relationships between power and gender as they intersect with other identities and social locations such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Social class|socio-economic class]], and [[Disability studies|disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions: classic and contemporary readings|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M. |last2=Lee|first2=Janet|isbn=978-0078027000|edition=Sixth|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 [[Australian]] feminist Madge Dawson took up a lectureship in the Department of Adult Education at [[Sydney University]] and began researching and teaching on the status of women.

The first scholarly journal in interdisciplinary women's studies, ''Feminist Studies'', began publishing in 1972.&lt;ref name="FSAboutUs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/history.html|title=History|publisher=Feminist Studies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Women's Studies Association]] (of the United States) was established in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/content.asp?pl=19&amp;contentid=19|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw the growth and development of women's studies courses and programs across universities in the U.S., while the field continued to grapple with backlash from both conservative groups and concerns from those within the women's movement about the white, [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]], and [[heterosexual privilege]] of those in the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=16|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political aims of the feminist movement that compelled the formation of women's studies found itself at odds with the institutionalized academic feminism of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Studies on the Edge|last=Wiegman|first=Robyn|chapter=Feminism, Institutionalism, and the Idiom of Failure|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4274-8|editor-last=Scott|editor-first=Joan Wallach|location=Durham|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "woman" as a concept continued to be expanded, the exploration of social constructions of gender led to the field's expansion into both gender studies and sexuality studies.

The field of women's studies continued to grow during the 1990s and into the 2000s with the expansion of universities offering majors, minors, and certificates in women's studies, gender studies, and feminist studies. The first Ph.D. program in Women's Studies was established at [[Emory University]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/program_pages/gender.html|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there were 16 institutions offering a Ph.D. in Women's Studies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwsa.org/AF_institution_Directory.asp|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisguide.com/|title=Artemis Guide to Women's Studies in the U.S|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, UC Santa Cruz (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/|title=UC Santa Cruz – Feminist Studies|website=feministstudies.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Kentucky-Lexington (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gws.as.uky.edu/phd-program-gws|title=PHD Program {{!}} Gender &amp; Women's Studies|website=gws.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stony Brook University (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wgss/|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|website=www.stonybrook.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oregon State University (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/school-language-culture-and-society/wgss/phd-women-gender-and-sexuality-studies|title=PhD in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies! {{!}} College of Liberal Arts {{!}} Oregon State University|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced a Ph.D. in the field.

==  Theoretical traditions and research methods  ==
[[File:Students of Women and Gender Studies University of Haifa on training in writing in Wikipedia (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Students of Women and Gender Studies [[University of Haifa]]]]
Early women's studies courses and curricula were often driven by the question "where are the women?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's Studies – The Early Years: When Sisterhood Was Powerful|last=Rothenberg|first=Paula|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|location=New York|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, as more women were present in higher education as both students and faculty, questions arose about the male-centric nature of most courses and curricula. Women faculty in traditional departments such as history, English, and philosophy began to offer courses with a focus on women. Drawing from the women's movement's notion that "the personal is political," courses also began to develop around sexual politics, women's roles in society, and the ways in which women's personal lives reflect larger power structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=69|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, scholars of women's studies have taken [[post-modern]] approaches to understanding gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age, and (dis)ability to produce and maintain power structures within society. With this turn, there has been a focus on language, subjectivity, and social hegemony, and how the lives of subjects, however they identify, are constituted. At the core of these theories is the notion that however one identifies, gender, sex, and sexuality are not intrinsic, but are socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/Files/Resources/WS_Integrative_Learning_Levine.pdf|title=Questions for A New Century: Women's Studies and Integrative Learning|last=Levin|first=Amy K.|date=2007|website=www.nwsa.org|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major theories employed in women's studies courses include [[feminist theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[standpoint theory]], [[transnational feminism]], and [[social justice]]. Research practices associated with women's studies place women and the experiences of women at the center of inquiry through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Feminist researchers acknowledge their role in the production of knowledge and make explicit the relationship between the researcher and the research subject.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Feminist theory ===

[[Feminist theory]] refers to the body of writing that works to address gender discrimination and disparities, while acknowledging, describing, and analyzing the experiences and conditions of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist theory: a reader|last1=Kolmar|first1=Wendy K.|last2=Bartkowski|first2=Frances|year=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=9780073512358|edition=4th|location=New York|page=2|oclc=800352585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists and writers such as [[bell hooks]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir,]] [[Patricia Hill Collins]], and [[Alice Walker]] added to the field of feminist theory with respect to the ways in which race and gender mutually inform the experiences of women of color with works such as ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' (hooks), ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'' (Walker), and ''[[Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment|Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment]]'' (Collins). Alice Walker coined the term [[womanism]] to situate black women's experiences as they struggle for social change and liberation, while simultaneously celebrating the strength of black women, their culture, and their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Womanist reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|last=Phillips|first=Layli|isbn=9780415954112|location=New York|oclc=64585764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Hill Collin's contributed the concept of the "[[matrix of domination]]" to feminist theory, which reconceptualizes race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression that shape experiences of privilege and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment|first=Patricia Hill|last=Collins|isbn=9780415964722|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=245597448|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===

Associated with the third wave of feminism, [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]]'s theory of [[intersectionality]] is an approach to understanding how institutional structures mutually shape an individual's gendered, racial, and social status. Intersectional theory posits that these relationships must be considered in conversation with each other in order to understand hierarchies of power and privilege and they ways in which they manifest in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carastathis|first=Anna|date=2014-05-01|title=The Concept of Intersectionality in Feminist Theory|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=304–314|doi=10.1111/phc3.12129|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standpoint theory ===

[[Standpoint theory]] developed in the 1980s as way of critically examining the production of knowledge and its resulting effects on practices of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminist standpoint theory reader: intellectual and political controversies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|last=Harding|first=Sandra G.|isbn=978-0415945004|location=New York|page=2|oclc=51668081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory operates from the idea that knowledge is socially situated and, as a result, underrepresented groups and minorities have historically been ignored or marginalized when it comes to the production of knowledge. Emerging from Marxist thought, standpoint theory argues for analysis that challenges the authority of political and social "truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hekman|first=Susan|date=1997|title=Truth and Method: Feminist Standpoint Theory Revisited|jstor=3175275|journal=Signs|volume=22|issue=2|pages=341–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transnational feminist theory ===

[[Transnational feminism]] is concerned with the flow of social, political, and economic equality of women and men across borders, particularly in response to globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women worldwide: transnational feminist perspectives on women|last=Moghadam|first=Valentine M.|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Janet|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Susan M.|year=|isbn=9780073512297|location=New York, NY|pages=15|chapter=Transnational Feminisms|oclc=436028205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies began incorporating transnational feminist theory into its curricula as a way to disrupt and challenge the ways knowledge is prioritized, transmitted, and circulates in the field and academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking women's and gender studies|last=Parisi|first=Laura|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=Orr|editor1-first=Catherine Margaret|editor2-last=Braithwaite|editor2-first=Ann|editor3-last=Lichtenstein|editor3-first=Diane Marilyn|isbn=9780415808316|location=New York|pages=326|chapter=Transnational|oclc=738351967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===

Since its inception and connection with the women's movement, activism has been a foundation of women's studies. Increasingly [[social justice]] has become a key component of women's studies courses, programs, and departments. Social justice theory is concerned with the fight for just communities, not on the individual level, but for the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements|last1=Capeheart|last2=Milovanovic|first2=Dragan|first1=Loretta|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813541686|location=Piscataway|page=2|oclc=437192947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies students engage in social justice projects, although some scholars and critics are concerned about requiring students to engage in mandated activism or social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jennifer L. |first2=Susanne |last2=Luhmann |title=Social Justice for (University) Credit? The Women's and Gender Studies Practicum in the Neoliberal University. (Report) |journal=Resources for Feminist Research |volume=34 |issue=3–4 |year=2016 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Pedagogies  ==
In most institutions, women's studies courses employ [[feminist pedagogy]] in a triad model of equal parts research, theory, and praxis. The decentralization of the professor as the source of knowledge is often fundamental to women's studies classroom culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrewsbury|first=Carolyn M.|date=Fall 1987|title=What is feminist pedagogy?|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Feminist Pedagogy|volume=15|issue=3–4|pages=6–14|jstor=40003432|ref=harv}}

Women's studies courses focus on a variety of topics such as media literacy, sexuality, race and ethnicity, history involving women, queer theory, multiculturalism and other courses closely related. Faculty incorporate these components into classes across a variety of topics, including popular culture, women in the economy, reproductive and environmental justice, and women's health across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship|last1=Berger|first1=Michele Tracy|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|edition=Second|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's studies programs are involved in social justice work and often design curricula that are embedded with theory and activism outside of the classroom setting. Some women's studies programs offer internships that are community-based allowing students the opportunity to experience how institutional structures of privilege and oppression directly affects women's lives. Women's studies curricula often encourage students to participate in [[service-learning]] activities in addition to discussion and reflection upon course materials. However, [[Daphne Patai]], from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has criticized this aspect of women's studies programs, arguing that they place politics over education, stating that "the strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions."&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/fem_overhaul.html|title=Why Not A Feminist Overhaul of Higher Education?|last=Patai|first=Daphne|date=January 23, 1998|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since women's studies students analyze identity markers such as gender, race, class, and sexuality, this often results in dissecting institutionalized structures of power. As a result of these pedagogies, women's studies students leave university with a toolset to make social change and do something about power inequalities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bubriski |first1=Anne |last2=Semaan |first2=Ingrid |year=2009 |title=Activist Learning vs. Service Learning in a Women's Studies Classroom |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women's studies scholars include [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Patricia Hill Collins]], [[bell hooks]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Barbara Ransby]].
