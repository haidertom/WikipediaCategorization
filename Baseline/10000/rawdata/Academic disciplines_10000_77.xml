{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |expanded=religion}}
'''Afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''') is the concept that an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual's [[Personal identity|identity]] or the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] continues to manifest after the [[death]] of the physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].

In some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

Some belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of a different being.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Different metaphysical models==
[[Theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24-29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M. Gross |title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK37AxCfxVEC  |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0513-1 |pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures,{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]] and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

London: Saqi. pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-86356-690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rosicrucians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]] (1985) [1939, 1908] ''The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures (Collected Works)'': [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]. Oceanside, California. 4th edition. {{ISBN|0-911274-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of [[Neoplatonism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Manicheanism]], and [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Roman era]] as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;An important recent work discussing the mutual influence of ancient Greek and Indian philosophy regarding these matters is ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' by [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity Church]] and its founder [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]] teach reincarnation.

===Heaven and hell===
{{Main|Heaven|Hell}}
[[Heaven]], the heavens, [[seven heavens]], [[pure land]]s, [[Tian]], [[Jannah]], [[Valhalla]], or [[the Summerland]], is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[jinn]], [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].

In [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death - Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].

[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],&lt;!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--&gt; while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.

==Ancient religions==

===Ancient Egyptian religion===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===
{{main|Greek underworld}}
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, "Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.&lt;ref&gt;Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

===Norse religion===
{{main|Norse religion#Afterlife|Death in Norse paganism}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. "Hall of the Slain" i.e. "the Chosen Ones") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/theNineWorlds.php|title=Norse Mythology {{!}} The Nine Worlds|website=www.viking-mythology.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fólkvangr]]: (lit. "Field of the Host") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as Fólkvangr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spangenhelm.com/folkvangr-freyjas-field-warriors/|title=Fólkvangr, Freyja welcomes you to the Field of the Host|date=2016-05-20|work=Spangenhelm|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. "The Covered Hall") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. "The Dark" or "Misty Hel") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}

====She'ol====
[[She'ol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rainwater|1996|p=819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2017}}

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC–70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"&gt;{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word "[[Hades]]" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.&lt;ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"/&gt;

====World to Come====
The [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal [[damnation]]", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.

The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies? Do Jews believe in reincarnation? In hell or heaven? Purgato |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi&lt;/ref&gt; according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die&amp;nbsp;..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&amp;nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation « Ask! « Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=2003-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, "Legende des Baalschem" in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

===Christianity===

{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of "eternal damnation" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.

When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the [[angels]] in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&amp;version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23-33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible - IntraText |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1956. page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'': a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphasis added)—Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527235028/http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp |date=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun [[Purgatory|"purgatorium"]] (Latin: place of cleansing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory "purgatory"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, '&amp;#39;A Latin Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E. '&amp;#39;Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg Foundation, 2000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of [[Hell]] (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/&gt;

====The Catholic Church====
The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by [[Lorenzo Scupoli]], states that four assaults are attempted by the “evil one” at the hour of death.&lt;ref&gt;http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritual_combat.pdf#page35&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

=====Limbo=====
{{main|Limbo}}
Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Purgatory=====
{{main|Purgatory}}
The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=2011-07-22 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=4746355&amp;content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&amp;notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one’s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 245.]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."&lt;ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"/&gt; For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."&lt;ref&gt;St. Isaac the Syrian, "Homily 28," In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God’s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Thomas Hopko, "Foreword," in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Clément]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud &amp; Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2011), 251.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumena]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"&lt;ref&gt;Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====
{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]

[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18-20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived– Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to "True to the Faith" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&amp;C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as "afterlife"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are "asleep". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G.

===Islam===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|An artists representation of "Muhammed's Paradise". A [[Persian miniature]] from ''The History of Mohammed'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
[[File:Idris the prophet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] is shown the afterlife places by an [[Angels in Islam|angel]]. In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]
{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or "[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah" over and over again to acquire good deeds.

In the Quran, God gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship Allah alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it punishment or ''Jannat'' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?").

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.

====Ahmadiyya====
[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=elementary+study+of+islam&amp;q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sufi====
The Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or "isthmus." It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64–8, 73, 75–8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith on life after death}}
The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God's presence]]. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin |year= 2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 96–97, 118–119, 135–136, 322–323| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings &amp; deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in "[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus "Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Sikhism===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
[[Sikhism]] may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.

Also it has been noted by many scholars that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of [[Kabir]], [[Baba Farid|Farid]] and [[Ramananda]]. The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and in ''[[Dasam granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] also believes in the after life. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional African religions===
[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]] have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bond|first1=George C.|editor1-last=Obayashi|editor1-first=Hiroshi|title=Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-27906-3|pages=3–18|chapter=Living with Spirits: Death and Afterlife in African Religions|quote=The entire process of death and burial is simple, without elaborate rituals and beliefs in an afterlife.

===Shinto===
{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W. Harris - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity&amp;nbsp;...

===Spiritualism===
According to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9781841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781841814490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.&lt;ref name="Afterlife"/&gt;

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

[[Misvan Gatu]] is the "place of the mixed ones" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife.

W. Norton &amp; Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-393-05962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Robert Ezra|title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science|page=90|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|isbn=0-691-14597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, though such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and thus do not qualify, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, as science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-385-46799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years of parapsychological research, [[Susan Blackmore]] came to the conclusion that there is no [[empirical evidence]] for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/Kurtz.htm |title=Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers pp 85–94 |publisher=Susanblackmore.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | title = Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57392-884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Modern philosophy===
There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of [[personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]], and in some ways similar to the old belief of [[monopsychism]], that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death were supported by some notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. [[Peter van Inwagen]], in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc|title=I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come |author=Peter van Inwagen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012631/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc |archivedate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hick]] also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, ''Death and Eternal Life'' using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the [[panentheistic]] model of [[process philosophy]] and theology the writers [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]] rejected that the universe was made of [[Matter|substance]], instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&amp;nbsp;32–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Griffin, "The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead's Philosophy," in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B. Mellert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109062948/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&amp;C=2598 |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 A Whiteheadian Conception of Immortality by Forrest Wood, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205005800/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2736&amp;C=2480 |date=2011-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Regarding the [[mind–body problem]], most neuroscientists take a [[physicalism|physicalist]] position according to which consciousness derives from and/or is reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity occurring in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schwartz. ''Appendix D: Consciousness and the Neurobiology of the Twenty-First Century''. In Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM. (2000). ''Principles of Neural Science, 4th Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580394,00.html "The Brain: The Mystery of Consciousness"]. Time. Monday, January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this premise is that once the brain stops functioning at [[brain death]], consciousness fails to survive and [[eternal oblivion|ceases to exist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bernat JL|date=8 Apr 2006|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68508-5|issue=9517|journal=Lancet|pages=1181–1192|pmid=16616561|title=Chronic disorders of consciousness|volume=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Laureys|Laureys, Steven]]; Tononi, Giulio.

Consciousness is, therefore, permanently lost in brain death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Vera|last2=Faísca|first2=Luís|last3=de Sá-Saraiva|first3=Rodrigo|title=Immortality of the Soul as an Intuitive Idea: Towards a Psychological Explanation of the Origins of Afterlife Beliefs|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=1|page=121|doi=10.1163/156853712X633956|url=http://sapientia.ualg.pt/bitstream/10400.1/4894/1/Immortality%20of%20the%20soul%20as%20an%20intuitive%20idea.%20Towards%20a%20psychological%20explanation%20of%20the%20origins%20of%20afterlife%20beliefs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misailidi|first1=Plousia|last2=Kornilaki|first2=Ekaterina N|title=Development of Afterlife Beliefs in Childhood: Relationship to Parent Beliefs and Testimony|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=April 2015|volume=61|issue=2|pages=290–318|issn=0272-930X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algorithm characterizations''' are attempts to formalize the word [[algorithm]]. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers&lt;ref&gt;cf [164] Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich "Algorithms: A Quest for Absolute Definitions" Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science Number 81 (October 2003), pages 195–225. Reprinted in Chapter on Logic in Computer Science Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science World Scientific, 2004, pages 283–311 Reprinted in Church's Thesis After 70 Years Ontos Verlag, 2006, 24–57}, or http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/FutureOfLogic/paper.pdf (cited in a 2007 Dershowitz–Gurevich paper): Samual R. Buss, [[Alexander S. Kechris]], Anand Pillay, and Richard A. Shore, “The Prospects for Mathematical Logic in the Twenty-first Century”.&lt;/ref&gt; are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the "characterizations" of the notion of "algorithm" in more detail.

== The problem of definition ==
Over the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of "algorithm". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of "output" integers from other "input" integers – "input parameters" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.

The most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the [[computable function|recursive functions]] calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the [[Turing machine]] or its Turing equivalents—the primitive [[register machine]] or "counter machine" model, the [[Random Access Machine]] model (RAM), the [[Random access stored program machine]] model (RASP) and its functional equivalent "the [[computer]]".

When we are doing "arithmetic" we are really calculating by the use of "recursive functions" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.

The proofs that every "recursive function" we can ''calculate by hand'' we can ''compute by machine'' and vice versa—note the usage of the words ''calculate'' versus ''compute''—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the ''thesis'' (unproven assertion) that this includes ''every'' calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of [[Turing machine equivalents|Turing-equivalent]] machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of "algorithm" itself often refers back to "the [[Turing machine]]". This is discussed in more detail under '''Stephen Kleene's characterization'''.

The following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.

[
&lt;small&gt;A mathematical problem and its result can be considered as two points in a space, and the solution consists of a sequence of steps or a path linking them. Quality of the solution is a function of the path. There might be more than one attribute defined for the path, e.g. length, complexity of shape, an ease of generalizing, difficulty, and so on&lt;/small&gt;.

== Chomsky hierarchy == &lt;!-- at 1956 --&gt;
There is more consensus on the "characterization" of the notion of "simple algorithm".

All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the "simplicity notion" arises from the simplicity of the language. The [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky (1956) hierarchy]] is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s that generate [[formal language]]s. It is used for [[Taxonomy (general)|classifying]] of [[programming language]]s and [[abstract machine]]s.

From the ''Chomsky hierarchy'' perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than  unrestricted), it can be  characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical "unrestricted algorithm".

Examples: a "general purpose" macro language, like [[M4 (computer language)|M4]] is unrestricted ([[Turing complete]]), but the [[C preprocessor|C preprocessor macro language]] is not, so any algorithm expressed in ''C preprocessor'' is a "simple algorithm".

== Features of a Good Algorithm == 

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

The following are the features of a good algorithm.
1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.
2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.
3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.
4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.
5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.
6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.
7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.

== 1881 John Venn's negative reaction to W. Stanley Jevons's Logical Machine of 1870 ==
In early 1870 [[W. Stanley Jevons]] presented a "Logical Machine" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a [[syllogism]] or other [[logical form]] e.g. an argument reduced to a [[Boolean equation]]. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a "sort of ''logical piano'' [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are "played" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been "played", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method..." (Couturat 1914:75).

For his part [[John Venn]], a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that "it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known ''or likely to be discovered'' really deserve the name of logical machines" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of "algorithm" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that "may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor":
: (1) "There is, first, the statement of our data in accurate logical language",
: (2) "Then secondly, we have to throw these statements into a form fit for the engine to work with – in this case the reduction of each proposition to its elementary denials",
: (3) "Thirdly, there is the combination or further treatment of our premises after such reduction,"
: (4) "Finally, the results have to be interpreted or read off. This last generally gives rise to much opening for skill and sagacity."
He concludes that "I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine."(Venn 1881:119–121).

== 1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization ==
This section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that ''all'' calculations/computations—of ''every'' sort, the ''totality'' of—can ''equivalently'' be (i) ''calculated'' by use of five "[[primitive recursive]] operators" plus one special operator called the [[mu-operator]], or be (ii) ''computed'' by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.

Furthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of '''algorithm'''.

A reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. ''Calculation'' means done by hand, ''computation'' means done by Turing machine (or equivalent).  (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A "function" can be thought of as an "input-output box" into which a person puts natural numbers called "arguments" or "parameters" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called "the answer"). Think of the "function-box" as a little man either calculating by hand using "general recursion" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).

"Effectively calculable/computable" is more generic and means "calculable/computable by ''some'' procedure, method, technique ... whatever...".  "General recursive" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just "recursion"; however, "primitive recursion"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the "primitive recursive functions."

=== 1943 "Thesis I", 1952 "Church's Thesis" ===
In 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as [[Church's thesis]]:
: "''Thesis I''. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive" (First stated by Kleene in 1943 (reprinted page 274 in Davis, ed. ''The Undecidable''; appears also verbatim in Kleene (1952) p.300)

In a nutshell: to calculate ''any'' function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of "general" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the [[mu recursive function]]s).

Kleene's first statement of this was under the section title "'''12. Algorithmic theories'''". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:
: "Thesis I and its converse provide the exact definition of the notion of a calculation (decision) procedure or '''algorithm''', for the case of a function (predicate) of natural numbers" (p. 301, boldface added for emphasis)

(His use of the word "decision" and "predicate" extends the notion of calculability to the more general manipulation of symbols such as occurs in mathematical "proofs".)

This is not as daunting as it may sound – "general" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five "operators" of the [[primitive recursive function]]s together with the additional [[mu-operator]] as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see [[primitive recursive function|Some common primitive recursive functions]].
&lt;!--'''Some functions definable by primitive recursion''' (Kleene (1952) pp. 223ff; Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey 2002 pp. 63ff)

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be four types (1) numerical in nature – "number-theoretic" or just "functions" { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...}, (2) predicates { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { t, f }, (3) truth-value or propositional connectives { t, f } to { t, f }, and "representing functions" { t, f } to { 0, 1 }. A predicate requires a "representing function" to convert { t, f } to { 0, 1 }: by definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values o and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

(Kleene (1952) p. 231)--&gt;

'''Why general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?'''

Kleene et al. (cf §55 General recursive functions p.&amp;nbsp;270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or [[mu-operator]]) because [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]] (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the [[Ackermann function]]—and [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:
: "...in a certain sense, the length of the computation '''algorithm''' of a recursive function which is not also primitive recursive grows faster with the arguments than the value of any primitive recursive function" (Kleene (1935) reprinted p. 246 in ''The Undecidable'', plus footnote 13 with regards to the need for an additional operator, boldface added).
&lt;!-- Kleene gives a second example using Péter's demonstration that "leads to ... predicates which are not primitive recursive". Specifically:
::All primitive recursive functions of one variable are [[enumerable]]: countable, can be placed one-to-one with the integers. But by the method of [[Cantor]]'s [[diagonal method]] this means that other functions of one variable exist but cannot be generated by primitive recursion. For example, we just add the number 1 to the diagonal number, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(a)+1, and thereby we see a single-variable function exists that cannot be created by primitive recursion alone. --&gt;

But the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. [[super-exponentiation]] ).

=== 1952 "Turing's thesis" ===
[[Turing's Thesis]] hypothesizes the computability of "all computable functions" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.

To do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of "computable" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of "functions" both "total functions" and "partial functions". A ''total function'' is one that is defined ''for '''all''' natural numbers'' (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for ''some'' natural numbers but not all—the specification of "some" has to come "up front". Thus the inclusion of "partial function" extends the notion of function to "less-perfect" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.
: Examples:
:: "Functions": include "common subtraction ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''" and "addition ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''"

:: "Partial function": "Common subtraction" ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is undefined when only natural numbers (positive integers and zero) are allowed as input – e.g. 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7 is undefined

:: Total function: "Addition" ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' is defined for all positive integers and zero.

&lt;!-- A partial function is restricted to use only an "''n''-tuple" (a list of input "parameters") defined at the outset:
: Definition: "A partial function is a function which for each ''n''-tuple ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of natural numbers as arguments takes at most one natural number ''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as value" (p.325).
::When an ''n''-tuple produces a value we say its function ''φ'' is defined for that ''n''-tuple; otherwise we say ''φ'' is undefined for that ''n''-tuple.

: Definition: "A partial function of positive integers is one whose domain [i.e. the list of possible "input" positive integers] is something less than the whole set P [of positive integers]" (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) p. 7) --&gt;

We now observe Kleene's definition of "computable" in a formal sense:
: Definition: "A partial function φ is ''computable'', if there is a machine M which computes it" (Kleene (1952) p. 360)

: "Definition 2.5. An ''n''-ary function ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is '''partially computable''' if there exists a Turing machine Z such that
:: ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
: In this case we say that [machine] Z computes ''f''. If, in addition, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a total function, then it is called '''computable'''" (Davis (1958) p. 10)

Thus we have arrived at ''Turing's Thesis'':
: "Every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable ... by one of his machines..." (Kleene (1952) p.376)

Although Kleene did not give examples of "computable functions" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the [[primitive recursive functions]]:
: Computable by Turing machine:
:: Addition (also is the Constant function if one operand is 0)
:: Increment (Successor function)
:: Common subtraction (defined only if ''x'' ≥ ''y''). Thus "''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''" is an example of a partially computable function.
:: Proper subtraction ''x''┴''y'' (as defined above)
:: The identity function: for each ''i'', a function U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; =  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) exists that plucks ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; out of the set of arguments (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
:: Multiplication

Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:
:: Doubling: 2''p''
:: Parity
:: Addition
:: Multiplication

With regards to the [[counter machine]], an [[abstract machine]] model equivalent to the Turing machine:
: Examples Computable by Abacus machine (cf Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002))
:: Addition
:: Multiplication
:: Exponention: (a flow-chart/block diagram description of the algorithm)

Demonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):
: The six recursive function operators:
::# Zero function
::# Successor function
::# Identity function
::# Composition function
::# Primitive recursion (induction)
::# Minimization

The fact that the abacus/[[counter machine models]] can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is "machine computable" then it is "hand-calculable by partial recursion". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :
: "''Theorem XXIX: "Every computable partial function φ is partial recursive...''" (italics in original, p. 374).

The converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.

=== 1952 Church–Turing Thesis ===
With his Theorem XXX Kleene '''proves''' the ''equivalence'' of the two "Theses"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – ''these he has not proven''):
: ''THEOREM XXX: The following classes of partial functions ... have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions ..."''(p. 376)

:: Definition of "partial recursive function": "A partial function φ is partial recursive in [the partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; if there is a system of equations E which defines φ recursively from [partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;" (p. 326)

Thus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an "''effectively calculable/computable'' function". If we accept the hypothesis that ''every'' calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the [[Church–Turing Thesis]] (the hypothesis of "every").

=== A note of dissent: "There's more to algorithm..." Blass and Gurevich (2003) ===
The notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the "Church–Turing thesis" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:
: "...we disagree with Kleene that the notion of '''algorithm''' is that well understood. In fact the notion of algorithm is richer these days than it was in Turing's days. And there are algorithms, of modern and classical varieties, not covered directly by Turing's analysis, for example, algorithms that interact with their environments, algorithms whose inputs are abstract structures, and geometric or, more generally, non-discrete algorithms" (Blass-Gurevich (2003) p. 8, boldface added)

== 1954 A. A. Markov's characterization ==

[[A. A. Markov]] (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:

: "1. In mathematics, "algorithm" is commonly understood to be an exact prescription, defining a computational process, leading from various initial data to the desired result...."

: "The following three features are characteristic of algorithms and determine their role in mathematics:
:: "a) the precision of the prescription, leaving no place to arbitrariness, and its universal comprehensibility -- the definiteness of the algorithm;
:: "b) the possibility of starting out with initial data, which may vary within given limits -- the generality of the algorithm;
:: "c) the orientation of the algorithm toward obtaining some desired result, which is indeed obtained in the end with proper initial data -- the conclusiveness of the algorithm." (p.1)

He admitted that this definition "does not pretend to mathematical precision" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his "normal" algorithm—as "equivalent to the concept of a [[recursion|recursive function]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp.&amp;nbsp;63ff):

: "1. Separate  elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of [the substitution] rules... [rules given at the outset]

: "2. ... steps of local nature ... [Thus the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol]

: "3. Rules for the substitution formulas ... [he called the list of these "the scheme" of the algorithm]

: "4. ...a means to distinguish a "concluding substitution" [i.e. a distinguishable "terminal/final" state or states]

In his Introduction Markov observed that "the entire significance for mathematics" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be "in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: "...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...". For more see [[constructive mathematics]] and [[Intuitionism]].

'''Distinguishability and Locality''': Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --
: "The new observed squares must be immediately recognizable by the computer [''sic'': a computer was a person in 1936]. I think it reasonable to suppose that they can only be squares whose distance from the closest of the immediately observed squares does not exceed a certain fixed amount. Let us stay that each of the new observed squares is within L squares of one of the previously observed squares." (Turing (1936) p. 136 in Davis ed. ''Undecidable'')

Locality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's "Fourth Principle for Mechanisms" is "The Principle of Local Causality":
: "We now come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depend only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitiation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance." (Gandy (1980) p. 135 in J. Barwise et al.)

== 1936, 1963, 1964 Gödel's characterization ==
'''1936''': A rather famous quote from [[Kurt Gödel]] appears in a "Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper "On the Length of Proofs" translated by [[Martin Davis]] appearing on pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83 of ''The Undecidable''. A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:
: "Thus, the concept of "computable" is in a certain definite sense "absolute," while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system with respect to which they are defined." (p. 83)

'''1963''': In a "Note" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'' (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that "[[formal system]]s" have "the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices" (p.&amp;nbsp;616 in van Heijenoort). ". . . due to "A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible." (p.&amp;nbsp;616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.

'''1964''': In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that "formal systems" are those that can be mechanized:
: "In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given . . . Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computational procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of a "Turing machine".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas . . . ." (p. 72 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable'': "Postscriptum" to "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems" appearing on p. 39, loc. cit.)

The * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by [[Alan Turing]] (1937) and [[Emil Post]] (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:
: "As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see [[Alonzo Church]], Am. J. Math., vol. 58 (1936) [appearing in ''The Undecidable'' pp. 100-102]).

Church's definitions encompass so-called "[[recursion]]" and the "[[lambda calculus]]" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of "effective calculatibility" and "recursiveness" with Gödel but that he independently questioned "effectively calculability" and "λ-definability":
: "We now define the notion . . . of an effectively calculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive function of positive integers&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (or of a λ-definable function of positive integers.
: "It has already been pointed out that, for every function of positive integers which is effectively calculable in the sense just defined, there exists an algorithm for the calculation of its value.
: "Conversely it is true . . ." (p. 100, The Undecidable).

It would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was "much less suitable." He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:
: ("Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures** not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.") (p. 72, loc. cit.)

: "(For theories and procedures in the more general sense indicated in footnote ** the situation may be different. Note that the results mentioned in the postscript do not establish any bounds for the powers of human reason, but rather for the potentialities of pure formalism in mathematics.) (p. 73 loc. cit.)

: Footnote **: "I.e., such as involve the use of abstract terms on the basis of their meaning. See my paper in Dial. 12(1958), p. 280." (this footnote appears on p. 72, loc. cit).

== 1967 Minsky's characterization ==
Minsky (1967) baldly asserts that "an algorithm is "an effective procedure" and declines to use the word "algorithm" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about "Algorithm, ''synonym'' for Effective procedure"(p.&amp;nbsp;311):
:: "We will use the latter term [an ''effective procedure''] in the sequel. The terms are roughly synonymous, but there are a number of shades of meaning used in different contexts, especially for 'algorithm'" (italics in original, p. 105)

Other writers (see Knuth below) use the word "effective procedure". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of "an effective procedure"? He starts off with:
: "...a set of rules which tell us, from moment to moment, precisely how to behave" (p. 106)

But he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:
: "... the criticism that the interpretation of the rules is left to depend on some person or agent" (p. 106)

His refinement? To "specify, along with the statement of the rules, ''the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them''". To avoid the "cumbersome" process of "having to do this over again for each individual procedure" he hopes to identify a "reasonably ''uniform'' family of rule-obeying mechanisms". His "formulation":
:: "(1) a ''language'' in which sets of behavioral rules are to be expressed, and

:: "(2) a ''single'' machine which can interpret statements in the language and thus carry out the steps of each specified process." (italics in original, all quotes this para. p. 107)

In the end, though, he still worries that "there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective" (p.&amp;nbsp;107)

But Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces "Turing's Analysis of Computation Process" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls "Turing's ''thesis''"
: "Any process which could naturally be called an effective procedure can be realized by a Turing machine" (p. 108. (Minsky comments that in a more general form this is called "''Church's thesis''").

After an analysis of "Turing's Argument" (his chapter 5.3)
he observes that "equivalence of many intuitive formulations" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan "...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:
:: "In this sense, the notion of effectively computable function is one of the few 'absolute' concepts produced by modern work in the foundations of mathematics'" (Minsky p. 111 quoting Rogers, Hartley Jr (1959) ''The present theory of Turing machine computability'', J. SIAM 7, 114-130.)

== 1967 Rogers' characterization ==
In his 1967 ''Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability'' Hartley Rogers' characterizes "algorithm" roughly as "a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic ''inputs'' and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic ''output''"(p.&amp;nbsp;1). He then goes on to describe the notion "in approximate and intuitive terms" as having 10 "features", 5 of which he asserts that "virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). The remaining 5 he asserts "are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

The 5 "obvious" are:
* 1 An algorithm is a set of instructions of finite size,
* 2 There is a capable computing agent,
* 3 "There are facilities for making, storing, and retrieving steps in a computation"
* 4 Given #1 and #2 the agent computes in "discrete stepwise fashion" without use of continuous methods or analogue devices",
* 5 The computing agent carries the computation forward "without resort to random methods or devices, e.g. , dice" (in a footnote Rogers wonders if #4 and #5 are really the same)

The remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:
* 6 No fixed bound on the size of the inputs,
* 7 No fixed bound on the size of the set of instructions,
* 8 No fixed bound on the amount of memory storage available,
* 9 A fixed finite bound on the capacity or ability of the computing agent (Rogers illustrates with example simple mechanisms similar to a [[Post–Turing machine]] or a [[counter machine]]),
* 10 A bound on the length of the computation -- "should we have some idea, 'ahead of time', how long the computationwill take?" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Rogers requires "only that a computation terminate after ''some'' finite number of steps; we do not insist on an a priori ability to estimate this number." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

== 1968, 1973 Knuth's characterization ==
[[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:

# '''Finiteness''': "An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps ... a ''very'' finite number, a reasonable number"
# '''Definiteness''': "Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case"
# '''Input''': "...quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects"
# '''Output''': "...quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs"
# '''Effectiveness''': "... all of the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using paper and pencil"

Knuth offers as an example the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for determining the [[greatest common divisor]] of two [[natural number]]s (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;2).

Knuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what "precisely defined" means, or "rigorously and unambiguously specified" means, or "sufficiently basic", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines ''in detail'' what he calls the "[[machine language]]" for his "mythical [[MIX]]...the world's first polyunsaturated computer" (pp.&amp;nbsp;120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses [[Decision tree|tree diagrams]], [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]]s and [[state diagram]]s.

'''"Goodness" of an algorithm, "best" algorithms''': Knuth states that "In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms...." He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its "adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc." Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is "best"? He calls this sort of inquiry "algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;7)

== 1972 Stone's characterization ==
Stone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):

: "To summarize ... we define an algorithm to be a '''set of rules''' that precisely defines '''a sequence of operations''' such that each rule is '''effective''' and '''definite''' and such that the '''sequence terminates''' in a finite time." (boldface added, p. 8)

Stone is noteworthy because of  his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his '''robot''', or person-acting-as-robot, must have some '''information and abilities within''' them, and if not '''the information and the ability must be provided''' in "the algorithm":

: "For people to follow the rules of an algorithm, the '''rules''' must be formulated so that they can be '''followed in a robot-like manner''', that is, without the need for thought... however, if the instructions [to solve the quadratic equation, his example] are to be obeyed by someone who knows how to perform arithmetic operations but does not know how to extract a square root, then we must also provide a set of rules for extracting a square root in order to satisfy the definition of algorithm" (p. 4-5)

Furthermore, "...'''not all instructions are acceptable''', because they may require the robot to have '''abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable'''.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:
: “an intuitive definition of an acceptable sequence of instructions is one in which '''each instruction is precisely defined''' so that the '''robot is guaranteed to be able to obey it'''” (p. 6)

After providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the [[Turing machine]] model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine’s instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p.&amp;nbsp;9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “''computation'' of a Turing machine is ''described'' by stating:
: "1. The tape alphabet

: "3. The initial state of the Turing machine
: "4. The '''form''' in which '''answers [output]''' will be represented on the tape when the Turing machine halts
: "5. The machine program" (italics added, p. 10)

This precise prescription of what is required for "a computation" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.

== 1995 Soare's characterization ==

: "A ''computation'' is a process whereby we proceed from initially given objects, called ''inputs'', according to a fixed set of rules, called a ''program, procedure,'' or '''''algorithm''''', through a series of ''steps'' and arrive at the end of these steps with a final result, called the ''output''. The '''algorithm''', as a set of rules proceeding from inputs to output, must be precise and definite with each successive step clearly determined. The concept of ''computability'' concerns those objects which may be specified in principle by computations . . ."(italics in original, boldface added p. 3)

== 2000 Berlinski's characterization ==

While a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p.&amp;nbsp;160). His year-2000 book ''The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer'' contains the following definition of '''algorithm''':

: "'''''In the logician's voice:
::: "''an algorithm is
::: ''a finite procedure,
::: ''written in a fixed symbolic vocabulary,
::: ''governed by precise instructions,
::: ''moving in discrete steps, 1, 2, 3, . . .,
::: ''whose execution requires no insight, cleverness,
::: ''intuition, intelligence, or perspicuity,
::: ''and that sooner or later comes to an end.'''" (boldface and italics in the original, p. xviii)

== 2000, 2002 Gurevich's characterization ==
A careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that "an algorithm" is actually "a Turing machine" or "a [[pointer machine]]" doing a computation. An "algorithm" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather ''an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable''. Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:

: " . . . every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine . . . a program can be simulated and therefore given a precise meaning by a Turing machine." (p. 1)
&lt;!--:"Can one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine very closely and faithfully?" (italics in original, p. 2)--&gt;

: " It is often thought that the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm was solved by Church [1936] and Turing [1936]. For example, according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational ''process'' defined by a Turing machine. Church and Turing did not solve the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm. Instead they gave (different but equivalent) formalizations of the notion of computable function, and there is more to an algorithm than the function it computes. (italics added p. 3)

: "Of course, the notions of algorithm and computable function are intimately related: by definition, a computable function is a function computable by an algorithm. . . . (p. 4)

&lt;!--:"While Turing analyzed a human computer, Kolmogorov and Uspensky [1958] arrived at their machine model (KU machines) [cf [[Pointer machine]] ] by analyzing cmoputations from the point of view of physics. . . . I attempted to [formulate a thesis for them]: "every computation performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine" [Gureviceh 1988]. Uspensky [1992, p. 396] agreed". (p. 4; Kolmogorov had died by this time)--&gt;

In Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between "Quisani" ("Q") and "Authors" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:
: "'''A:''' To localize the disagreement, let's first mention two points of agreement. First, there are some things that are obviously algorithms by anyone's definition -- Turing machines , sequential-time ASMs [Abstract State Machines], and the like. . . .Second, at the other extreme are specifications that would not be regarded as algorithms under anyone's definition, since they give no indication of how to compute anything . . . The issue is how detailed the information has to be in order to count as an algorithm. . . . Moshovakis allows some things that we would call only declarative specifications, and he would probably use the word "implementation" for things that we call algorithms." (paragraphs joined for ease of readability, 2002:22)

This use of the word "implementation" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:
: "...[H]e would probably think that your practical work [Gurevich works for Microsoft] forces you to think of implementations more than of algorithms. He is quite willing to identify implementations with machines, but he says that algorithms are something more general. What it boils down to is that you say an algorithm is a machine and Moschovakis says it is not." (2002:3)

But the authors waffle here, saying "[L]et's stick to "algorithm" and "machine", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:
: " . . . Nevertheless, if one accepts Moshovakis's point of view, then it is the "implementation" of algorithms that we have set out to characterize."(cf Footnote 9 2007:6)

== 2003 Blass and Gurevich's characterization ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Blass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of [[Turing machines]] and [[pointer machine]]s, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.

Gurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):

: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: '''every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine'''....In practice, it would be ridiculous...[Nevertheless,] [c]an one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine?...But suppose such generalized Turing machines exist. What would their states be?...a '''first-order structure''' ... a particular '''small instruction set''' suffices in all cases ... '''computation as an evolution of the state''' ... could be nondeterministic... can interact with their environment ... [could be] parallel and multi-agent ... [could have] [[dynamic semantics]] ... [the two underpinings of their work are:] Turing's thesis ...[and] the notion of (first order) structure of [Tarski 1933]" (Gurevich 2000, p. 1-2)

The above phrase '''computation as an evolution of the state''' differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the "algorithm" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called ''the complete configuration'' (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;118) -- and includes ''both'' the current instruction (state) ''and'' the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].

In [[Algorithm examples]] we see the '''evolution of the state''' first-hand.

== 1995 – Daniel Dennett: evolution as an algorithmic process==
Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:
* '''Substrate neutrality''': an algorithm relies on its ''logical'' structure. Thus, the particular form in which an algorithm is manifested is not important (Dennett's example is long division: it works equally well on paper, on parchment, on a computer screen, or using neon lights or in skywriting). (p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Underlying mindlessness''': no matter how complicated the end-product of the algorithmic process may be, each step in the algorithm is sufficiently simple to be performed by a non-sentient, mechanical device. The algorithm does not require a "brain" to maintain or operate it. "The standard textbook analogy notes that algorithms are ''recipes'' of sorts, designed to be followed by ''novice'' cooks."(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Guaranteed results''': If the algorithm is executed correctly, it will always produce the same results. "An algorithm is a foolproof recipe." (p.&amp;nbsp;51)

It is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that "According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process". (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

However, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb.{{According to whom|date=February 2013}} In the context of his chapter titled "Processes as Algorithms", he states:
: "But then . . are there any limits at all on what may be considered an algorithmic process? I guess the answer is NO; if you wanted to, you can treat any process at the abstract level as an algorithmic process. . . If what strikes you as puzzling is the uniformity of the [ocean's] sand grains or the strength of the [tempered-steel] blade, an algorithmic explanation is what will satisfy your curiosity -- and it will be the truth. . . .

: "No matter how impressive the products of an algorithm, the underlying process always consists of nothing but a set of {{sic|individualy}} mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision; they are 'automatic' by definition: the workings of an automaton." (p. 59)

It is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is [[intrinsic]]ally algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding "meaning" to the observations.

== 2002 John Searle adds a clarifying caveat to Dennett's characterization ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] is a proponent of [[Computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]]: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain [[mind]]. [[John Searle]], the creator of the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, claims that "[[syntax]] [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for [[semantic]] content [that is, meaning]" {{harv|Searle|2002|p=16}}. In other words, the "meaning" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.

Searle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are [[intrinsic]] to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):
{{quote
| text=Computation [...] is observer-relative, and this is because computation is defined in terms of symbol manipulation, but the notion of a 'symbol' is not a notion of physics or chemistry. Something is a symbol only if it is used, treated or regarded as a symbol. The Chinese room argument showed that semantics is not intrinsic to syntax. But what this shows is that syntax is not intrinsic to physics. [...] Something is a symbol only relative to some observer, user or agent who assigns a symbolic interpretation to it [...] you can assign a computational interpretation to anything. But if the question asks, "Is consciousness intrinsically computational?" the answer is: ''nothing is intrinsically computational'' [italics added for emphasis]. Computation exists only relative to some agent or observer who imposes a computational interpretation on some phenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years ago but I did not.

== 2002: Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey specification of Turing machine calculation ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

An example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.

(i) They have discussed the role of "number format" in the computation and selected the "tally notation" to represent numbers:
:: "Certainly computation can be harder in practice with some notations than others... But... it is possible in principle to do in any other notation, simply by translating the data... For purposes of framing a rigorously defined notion of computability, it is convenient to use monadic or tally notation" (p. 25-26)

(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a [[Turing machine]]. They have previously specified (p.&amp;nbsp;26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]].

(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the ''right'' of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]]. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):

: "We have not given an official definition of what it is for a numerical function to be computable by a '''Turing machine''', specifying how '''inputs''' or arguments are to be represented on the machine, and how '''outputs''' or values represented. Our specifications for a k-place function from positive integers to positive integers are as follows:
: "(a) ['''Initial number format:'''] The arguments m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... will be represented in monadic [unary] notation by blocks of those numbers of strokes, each block separated from the next by a single blank, on an otherwise blank tape.
:: Example: 3+2, 111B11
: "(b) ['''Initial head location, initial state:'''] Initially, the machine will be scanning the leftmost 1 on the tape, and will be in its initial state, state 1.
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;111B11
: "(c) ['''Successful computation -- number format at Halt:'''] If the function to be computed assigns a value n to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine will eventually halt on a tape containing a block of strokes, and otherwise blank...
:: Example: 3+2, 11111
: "(d) ['''Successful computation -- head location at Halt:'''] In this case [c] the machine will halt scanning the left-most 1 on the tape...
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;1111
: "(e) ['''Unsuccessful computation -- failure to Halt or Halt with non-standard number format:'''] If the function that is to be computed assigns no value to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine either will never halt, or will halt in some nonstandard configuration..."(ibid)
:: Example: B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;11111 or B11&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;111 or B11111&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

This specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--
: (iv) in the finite state machine's TABLE or, in the case of a [[Universal Turing machine]] on the tape, and
: (v) the Table of instructions in a specified format

This later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p.&amp;nbsp;36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to "shrink" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol. Indeed, the example Turing machine computation required only the 4 columns as shown in the table below (but note: these were presented to the machine in ''rows''):

== 2006: Sipser's assertion and his three levels of description ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

Sipser begins by defining '"algorithm" as follows:
: "Informally speaking, an ''algorithm'' is a collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task. Commonplace in everyday life, algorithms sometimes are called ''procedures'' or ''recipes'' (italics in original, p. 154)

: "...our real focus from now on is on algorithms. That is, the Turing machine merely serves as a precise model for the definition of algorithm .... we need only to be comfortable enough with Turing machines to believe that they capture all algorithms" ( p. 156)

Does Sipser mean that "algorithm" is just "instructions" for a Turing machine, or is the combination of "instructions + a (specific variety of) Turing machine"? For example, he defines the two standard variants (multi-tape and non-deterministic) of his particular variant (not the same as Turing's original) and goes on, in his Problems (pages 160-161), to describes four more variants (write-once, doubly infinite tape (i.e. left- and right-infinite), left reset, and "stay put instead of left). In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:
: "But note that unary notation for encoding numbers (as in the number 17 encoded by the uary string 11111111111111111) isn't reasonable because it is exponentially larger than truly reasonable encodings, such as base ''k'' notation for any ''k'' ≥ 2."(p. 259)

van Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the [[random access machine]] (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing "analysis of algorithms":
"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.

". . . [T]here hardly exists such as a thing as an "innocent" extension of the standard RAM model in the uniform time measures; either one only has additive arithmetic or one might as well include all reasonable multiplicative and/or bitwise Boolean instructions on small operands." (van Emde Boas, 1990:26)

With regards to a "description language" for algorithms Sipser finishes the job that Stone and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey started (boldface added). He offers us three levels of description of Turing machine algorithms (p.&amp;nbsp;157):
: '''High-level description''': "wherein we use ... prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."

: '''Implementation description''': "in which we use ... prose to describe the way that the Turing machine moves its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function."

: '''Formal description''': "... the lowest, most detailed, level of description... that spells out in full the Turing machine's states, transition function, and so on."

The '''antiquities trade''' is the exchange of [[antiquities]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] from around the world. This trade may be [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] or completely legal. The legal antiquities trade abide by national regulations, which now universally provides for extraction that allows for the scientific study of the artifacts in order to study the archaeological and anthropological context.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{clarify|date=May 2013}} The illicit antiquities trade involves non-scientific extraction that ignores the [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] context from the artifacts.

==Legal trade==
The legal trade in antiquities abide by the laws of the countries in which the artifacts originate. These laws establish how the antiquities may be extracted from the ground and the legal process in which artifacts may leave the country. In many countries excavations and exports were prohibited without official licenses already in the 19th century, as for example in the Ottoman Empire. According to the laws of the countries of origin, there can't be a legal trade with archaeological artifact without official papers. However, most national laws still overturn these regulations.

==Illicit trade==
{{see also|Art theft|Looted art}}
Illicit or illegal antiquities are those found in illegal or unregulated excavations, and traded covertly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/terminology/illicit-antiquities Illicit Antiquities], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black market]] trade of illicit antiquities is supplied by [[looting]] and [[art theft]]. Artifacts are often those that have been discovered and unearthed at archeological digs and then transported internationally through a middleman to often unsuspecting collectors, museums, antique dealers, and auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amineddoleh|first=Leila|date=2013-10-01|title=The Role of Museums in the Trade of Black Market Cultural Heritage Property|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2370699|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquities trade is much more careful in recent years about establishing the [[provenance]] of cultural artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/atwood.html Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3392057.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates put annual turnover in billions of US dollars.

It is believed by many archaeologists and cultural heritage lawyers that the demand created by circulation, marketing, and collectorship of ancient artifacts causes the continuous looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-state-antiquities-trade-stretches-europe-united-states-1724733|title=Islamic State Antiquities Trade Stretches To Europe, United States|date=2014-11-17|work=International Business Times|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | last1 = Brodie | first1 = Neil | last2 = Renfrew | first2 = Colin | year = 2005 | title = Looting and the world's archaeological heritage: the inadequate response | url = http://traffickingculture.org/publications/brodie-n-and-renfrew-c-2005-looting-and-the-worlds-archaeological-heritage-the-inadequate-response-annual-review-of-anthropology-34-343-61| journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 343–61 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological artifacts are internationally protected by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and their circulation is prohibited by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO Convention (1970) on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]].

=== Response ===
Recent trends reveal a large push to repatriate [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] illicitly extracted and traded on the international market. Such artifacts include those held by museums like the [[Getty Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-1999 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy 1999], [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2005 J Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2005)], and [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/j-paul-getty-museum-returns-to-italy-2007 J. Paul Getty Museum Returns to Italy (2007)], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/euphronios-sarpedon-krater Euphronios (Sarpedon) Krater], Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to solve the phenomenon of looting, aerial surveillance - the effectiveness of which depends on the capability to perform systematic prospections - is increasingly being used.  Nevertheless, it is impractical in several countries due to military activity, political restrictions, and/or huge areas and difficult environmental settings (desert, rain forest, etc..). In these contexts, space technology could offer a suitable chance as in the case of Peru. In this country an Italian scientific mission directed by [[Nicola Masini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16190824|title=Protecting Peru's ancient past|last=Cabitza|first=Mattia|date=2011-12-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 2008 have been using very high resolution satellite data to observe and monitor the phenomeno of 'huaqueros' in some archaeological areas in Southern and Northern Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Lasaponara R., Masini N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10670">'''Association mapping (genetics)''', also known as "[[linkage disequilibrium]] mapping", is a method of mapping [[quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] (QTLs) that takes advantage of historic linkage disequilibrium to link [[phenotype]]s (observable characteristics) to [[genotype]]s (the genetic constitution of organisms), uncovering [[genetic association]]s.

==Theory==
Association mapping is based on the idea that traits that have entered a population only recently will still be linked to the surrounding [[genetic sequence]] of the original evolutionary ancestor, or in other words, will more often be found within a given [[haplotype]], than outside of it. It is most often performed by scanning the entire genome for significant associations between a panel of SNPs (which, in many cases are spotted onto glass slides to create “[[SNP genotyping|SNP chips]]”) and a particular phenotype. These associations must then be independently verified in order to show that they either (a) contribute to the trait of interest directly, or (b) are linked to/ in linkage disequilibrium with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that contributes to the trait of interest.&lt;ref name="Gibson"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Primer of Genome Science |last=Gibson |first= G. |author2= Muse S.V. |year= 2009 |publisher= Sinauer Associates |location= MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association mapping seeks to identify specific functional genetic variants (loci, alleles) linked to phenotypic differences in a trait to facilitate detection of trait causing DNA sequence polymorphisms and selection of genotypes that closely resemble the phenotype. In order to identify these functional variants, it requires high throughput markers like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/0470022620.bbc17|title=Handbook of Statistical Genetics|last=Hoeschele|first=I.|date=2004-07-15|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=0470022620|location=Chichester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

The advantage of association mapping is that it can map quantitative traits with high resolution in a way that is statistically very powerful. Association mapping, however, also requires extensive knowledge of SNPs within the genome of the organism of interest, and is therefore difficult to perform in species that have not been well studied or do not have well-annotated [[genome]]s.&lt;ref name="Yu et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yu, J. |author2=Holland, J.B. |author3=McMullen, M.D. |author4=Buckler, E.S. |year= 2008 |title=Genetic design and statistical power of nested association mapping in maize|journal=Genetics |volume=178|pages=539&amp;ndash;551 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/178/1/539 |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.074245 |pmid=18202393 |issue=1 |pmc=2206100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Association mapping has been most widely applied to the study of human disease, specifically in the form of a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS). A genome-wide association study is performed by scanning an entire genome for SNPs associated with a particular trait of interest, or in the case of human disease, with a particular disease of interest.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite book |title=Genetics in Medicine |last=Nussbaum |first=R.L.|author2=McInnes, R.R.|author3=Willard, H.F.|year=2007 |publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, thousands of genome wide associations studies have been performed on the human genome in attempt to identify SNPs associated with a wide variety of complex human diseases (e.g. [[cancer]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[obesity]]). The results of all such published GWAS are maintained in an [http://www.genome.gov/26525384 NIH database] (figure 1). Whether or not these studies have been clinically and/or therapeutically useful, however, remains controversial.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum/&gt;

[[Image:GWAS.png|frame|center|Figure 1. Published genome-wide associations through 6/2009, 439 published GWA at ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10^-8.]]

==Types and Variations ==

'''(A) Association mapping in population where members are assumed to be independent.'''
 
Several standard methods to test for association. 
'''Case control studies –''' 
Case control studies was among the first approaches utilized to determine whether particular genetic variant is associated with increased risk of disease in humans. Early on, Woofle in 1955, proposed a relative risk statistic that could be used to assess genotype dependent risk. However persistent concern regarding these studies is the adequacy of matching cases and controls. In particular, population stratification can produce false positive associations. In response to this concern, Falk and Rubenstein in 1987, suggested a method for assessing relative risk that uses family based controls, obviating this source of potential error. Basically, the method uses a control sample of the parental alleles or haplotypes not transmitted to affected offspring.

'''(B) Association mapping population where members are assumed to be related'''

In the real world it is very hard to find independent (unrelated) individuals. Population based association mapping has been modified to control population stratification or relatedness in [[nested association mapping]]. Still there is one other limitation in population based QTL mapping; when the frequency of the favorable allele should be relatively high to be detected. Usually favorable alleles are rare mutant alleles ( for example usually a resistant parent might be 1 out of 10000 genotypes). Another variant of association mapping in related populations is family based association mapping. In family based association mapping instead of multiple unrelated individuals multiple unrelated families or pedigrees are used. The family based association mapping &lt;ref&gt;Rosyara U.R., J.L. Gonzalez-Hernandez, K.D. Glover, K.R. Gedye and J.M. Stein. 2009. Family-based mapping of quantitative trait loci in plant breeding populations with resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat as an illustration Theoretical Applied Genetics 118:1617-1631&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/6755j1401046545l/ external link]) can be used in situations where the mutant alleles have been introgressed in populations. One of popular family based association mapping Transmission disequilibrium test. For details please read [[Family based QTL mapping]].

==Advantages ==
The advantages of population based association mapping, utilizing a sample of individuals from the germplasm collections or a natural population, over traditional [[Quantitative trait locus|QTL-mapping]] in biparental crosses, primarily are due to availability of broader genetic variations with wider background for marker and trait correlations. The advantage of association mapping is that it can map quantitative traits with high resolution in a way that is statistically very powerful. The resolution of the mapping depends on the extent of [[Linkage disequilibrium|LD]], or non-random association of markers, that has occurred across the genome. Association mapping offers the opportunity to investigate diverse genetic material and potentially identify multiple alleles and mechanisms of underlying traits. It uses recombination events that have occurred over an extended period of time. Association mapping allows the possibility of exploiting historically measured trait data for association, and lastly has no need for the development of expensive and tedious biparental populations that makes approach timesaving and cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;Abdurakhmonov I., Abdukarimov A. (2008). Application of association mapping to understanding the genetic diversity of plant germplasm resources. International Journal of Plant Genomics. doi:10.1155/2008/574927.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraakman|first=A. T. W.|date=2004-09-01|title=Linkage Disequilibrium Mapping of Yield and Yield Stability in Modern Spring Barley Cultivars|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.026831|journal=Genetics|volume=168|issue=1|pages=435–446|doi=10.1534/genetics.104.026831|issn=0016-6731|pmc=1448125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations ==
A major issue with association studies is a tendency to find false positives. Populations showing a desired trait also carry a specific gene variant not because the variant actually controls the trait, but due to genetic relatedness. In particular, indirect associations that are not causal will not be eliminated by increasing the sample size or the number of markers. The main sources of such false positives are linkage between causal and noncausal sites, more than one causal site and epistasis. These indirect associations are not randomly distributed throughout the genome and are less common than false positives arising from population structure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platt|first=A.|last2=Vilhjalmsson|first2=B. J.|last3=Nordborg|first3=M.|date=2010-09-02|title=Conditions Under Which Genome-Wide Association Studies Will be Positively Misleading|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.110.121665|journal=Genetics|volume=186|issue=3|pages=1045–1052|doi=10.1534/genetics.110.121665|issn=0016-6731|pmc=2975277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, population structure has always remained a consistent issue. Population structure leads to spurious associations between markers and the trait. This generally is not a problem in linkage analysis because researchers know the genetic structure of the family they created. But in association mapping, where relationships between diverse populations are not necessarily well understood, marker–trait associations arising from kinship and evolutionary history can easily be mistaken for causal ones. This can be accounted for with mixed models MLM. Also called the Q+K model, it was developed to further reduce the false positive rate by controlling for both population structure and cryptic familial relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Jianming|last2=Pressoir|first2=Gael|last3=Briggs|first3=William H|last4=Vroh Bi|first4=Irie|last5=Yamasaki|first5=Masanori|last6=Doebley|first6=John F|last7=McMullen|first7=Michael D|last8=Gaut|first8=Brandon S|last9=Nielsen|first9=Dahlia M|date=2005-12-25|title=A unified mixed-model method for association mapping that accounts for multiple levels of relatedness|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng1702|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=38|issue=2|pages=203–208|doi=10.1038/ng1702|issn=1061-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Atomic engineering'''" appears to have been first used in 1946 by Theodore von Kármán,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore von Kármán, "Atomic Engineering?", Journal of Applied Physics 17 (1946) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And now it seems we are at the threshold of the new atomic age. I do not know whether or not this is true, but certainly, we shall have 'atomic engineering' in the fields of power and transportation. Are we prepared for the problems involved?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Atomic power]], which, today, is generally considered to be in the discipline of [[nuclear engineering]], is an example of what he had in mind.

Atomic engineering may be a superset of [[nuclear engineering]], due to the historical usage of terms like [[Atoms for Peace]] , [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], 'atomic engineer', etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.
An inclusive definition is: "exploiting the atomic characters of matter for [[engineering]] applications." For example, an [[atomic clock]] and potential applications of [[ultracold atoms|ultra-cold atom]] belong to atomic engineering. The atomic character could be the atomic spin (e.g. in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[quantum computing]] applications), atomic position (e.g. [[Optical lattice]]), atomic mass (e.g. atomic power), etc.

The creation of the atomic bomb by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the "Father of the atomic bomb", is based on atomic engineering. Oppenheimer was a university professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

[[Richard Feynman]], in his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" on the trend of [[miniaturization]], envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether, ultimately – in the great future – we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them. … When we get to the very, very, small world – say circuits of seven atoms – we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom", Caltech Engineering and Science 23 (5), 22 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most practices of [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] today have foci distinct from Feynman's ultimate vision of manipulating individual atomic position and spin, which may be better described by "Atomic engineering", that addresses characteristic length scales from 1 [[femtometer]] (the [[atomic nucleus]] size) to 1 [[nanometer]] (about 5 atoms across in linear dimension).  Coherent quantum control of individual atomic defect like the [[Nitrogen-vacancy center]], and the eventual "[[3D atom printing]]" ("2D atom printing" was realized in 1990 by IBM&lt;ref&gt;D. M. EIGLER and E. K. SCHWEIZER, "Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunnelling microscope", Nature 344 (1990) 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]), fit Feynman's ultimate vision.

'''Attainable region (AR) theory''' is a branch of [[chemical engineering]], specifically [[chemical reaction engineering]], that uses geometric and mathematical optimization concepts to assist in the design of networks of chemical reactors. AR theory is a method to help define the best reactor flowsheet using graphical techniques for a desired duty or objective function.&lt;ref name="UNISA Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor Systems Design (Attainable Regions)|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=97610|website=UNISA|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogler &amp; Gurmen © 2008 University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attainable Region Theory – University of Michigan|url=http://www.umich.edu/~elements/arpages/intro/intro.htm|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of AR theory ==
The initial concept of an attainable region for chemical processes was proposed by Fritz Horn in 1964, where he believed in geometric methods to improve process design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=Martin|date=2002|title=Toward a theory of process synthesis|url=|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were later refined and made specific to chemical reactors by co-developers David Glasser, Diane Hildebrandt,&lt;ref name="Amazon.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attainable Region Theory: An Introduction to Choosing an Optimal Reactor|isbn=978-1119157885|last1=Ming|first1=David|last2=Glasser|first2=David|last3=Metgzer|first3=Matthew|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Diane|last5=Glasser|first5=Benjamin|date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Feinberg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview ==
The AR is defined as the collection all possible outcomes for all conceivable reactor combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Matthew|last2=Glasser|first2=Benjamin|last3=Glasser|first3=David|last4=Hausberger|first4=Brendon|last5=Hildebrandt|first5=Diane|date=2007|title=Teaching Reaction Engineering Using the Attainable Region|url=http://coewww.rutgers.edu/bglasser/ResearchGroup/Publications/CEE07.pdf|journal=Chemical Engineering Education|page=258|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrically, the AR may (for instance) be represented as a convex region in state space representing all possible outlet compositions for all reactor combinations. A combination of reactors is often termed a reactor structure. An example of the reactors that are considered for this theory are [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor|Continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)]] and a [[Plug flow reactor model|Plug flow reactor model (PFR)]].

Knowledge of the AR helps to address two areas in chemical reactor design:
# The reactor network synthesis problem: Given a system of reactions and feed point, construction of the AR assists with determining an optimal reactor structure that achieves a desired duty or objective function. That is, AR theory assists with understanding specifically what type and combination of the chemical reactors are best suited for a particular system and duty. 
# Performance targeting: Given an existing reactor design, knowledge of the AR assists with understanding if there are other reactor structures that could achieve superior performance, by comparison to its location in the AR. Seeing as the AR represents all reactor designs by definition, different proposed reactor designs must lie as a point in or on the AR in state space. The effectiveness of each design may then all be assessed by comparison the AR and their relation to objective functions if any.

== Applications of theory ==
Examples of where AR theory can be applied, include:
* The design of [[batch reactor]] networks;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ming|first=David et al.|date=2013|title=Application of attainable region theory to batch reactors|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2013.06.001|pmid=|access-date=|volume=99|pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

The '''Basque Declaration''' (2016) is a formal document outlining 15 pathways for the development of more sustainable cities in Europe. The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns from 27-29 April 2016 in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The document can be seen as a continuation of the [[Aalborg Charter|Aalborg Charter (1994)]] and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local [[Agenda 21|Agenda 21]], and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/|title=About the Basque Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/fileadmin/repository/Basque_Declaration/BD_May_Update/Basque-Declaration-ENGLISH-www.pdf|title=The Basque Declaration (English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and ''implementing'' local transformative actions.

The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings:

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Cultural Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To develop a 'culture of sustainability'
* To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches
* To re-think boundaries between public and private activities
* To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants
* To nurture the [[sharing economy|sharing economy]] and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Economic Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production
* To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment
* To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies
* To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions
* To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output

&lt;u&gt;The Technological Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To wisely take advantage of smart technologies
* To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market
* To address the [[Digital divide|digital divide]] within local societies, focusing on equal access
* To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public
* The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes

==Transformative actions==

The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformative Action Award|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/|website=Sustainable Cities EU|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sustainablecities.eu/| Sustainable Cities EU] website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created.

'''''Bauer's Lexicon'''''&lt;!--book title abbreviations are capitalized--&gt; (also '''''Bauer Lexicon''''' and '''''Bauer's Greek Lexicon''''') is among the most highly respected dictionaries of [[Biblical Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Rykle Borger, "Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Wörterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis," Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Taylor (et al., eds.), pp. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the German forerunner are Erwin Preuschen and [[Walter Bauer]]. The English edition is '''''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature''''' (the 3rd edition was published in 2001 by the [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0226039331}}).

== History ==
The origin may be traced to Erwin Preuschen's ''Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1515/zatw.1908.28.4.U | title =  Vollständiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handwörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur |trans-title= Full Greek-German Concise Dictionary of the New Testament writings and other early Christian literature| journal = Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft [Journal of Old Testament Studies] | first = D. E.| last= Preuschen| language = German| volume = 28 | issue = 4 | year = 1908 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bauer extensively revised this work, as ''Griechisch-deutsches Wörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der übrigen urchristlichen Literatur''. 

In the fall of 1949, [[F. Wilbur Gingrich]] was granted a leave of absence from [[Albright College]] to work on a new Greek-English lexicon of the [[New Testament]], translating and adapting the work of [[Walter Bauer]]’s Greek-German lexicon (Bauer lexicon) in collaboration with Dr. William F. Arndt. The work actually took 5 ½ years.

The fourth German edition (1949–52) was translated to English by William F. Arndt and F. Wilbur Gingrich in 1957. Arndt died that same year, to be replaced by [[Frederick William Danker]], with whom Gingrich prepared the second English edition published in 1979.

A sixth German edition was published following Bauer's death in 1960, by [[Kurt Aland]], Barbara Aland and Viktor Reichmann. Gingrich died in 1993, leaving Danker to complete the 3rd English edition based on all the prior editions and substantial work of his own.

The second edition, '''''Bauer-Danker Greek Lexicon of the New Testament''''', was commonly known as '''''BAGD''''' ('''''Bauer–Arndt–Gingrich–Danker'''''). Danker published the third English edition in 2000. Given the extensive improvements in this edition (said to include over 15,000 new citations), it is now known as '''''Bauer–Danker–Arndt–Gingrich''''' ('''''BDAG''''') or sometimes the '''''Bauer-Danker Lexicon'''''.

A notable feature of the third English edition is vastly improved typography. This reflects early adoption of [[SGML]] technology. The entire lexicon was converted to SGML in the late 1980s at [[Dallas Seminary]] with collaboration from SGML experts interested in the project, and Danker actually did substantial editorial and authorial work in an SGML editing program. This technology permitted much more consistent and flexible typography, as well as information retrieval.

A Chinese translation of the lexicon, based on the third English edition, was published in 2009 in Hong Kong by Chinese Bible International Limited.

'''Bugchasing''', also known in slang as '''charging''', is the practice of pursuing [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals in order to contract HIV. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers. It is a form of [[self-harm]]. Bugchasers seek [[sexual partner]]s who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having [[Bareback (sex)|unprotected sex]] and becoming HIV-positive; '''giftgivers''' are HIV-positive individuals who comply with the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV.

Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers engage in the activity for the excitement and intimacy inherent in pursuing such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crossley Michelle | year = 2004 | title = 'Resistance' and health promotion | doi = 10.1348/0144666041501679 | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 225–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggest that the behavior may stem from a "resistance to dominant heterosexual norms and mores" due to a defensive response by gay men to repudiate stigmatization and rejection by society.&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt;

Some people consider bugchasing "intensely erotic" and the act of being infected through the "fuck of death" as the "ultimate taboo, the most extreme sex act left."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory A. Freeman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |title=Rolling Stone : Bug Chasers |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are HIV negative and in a [[Serodiscordant|relationship]] with someone who is HIV-positive may seek infection as a way to remain in the relationship, particularly when the HIV-positive partner may wish to break up to avoid infecting the HIV negative partner.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt; It has also been used as a form of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere | title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656| doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. | title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442| doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440 | pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

By design, bug chasing involves [[unprotected sex]], but members of the [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] subculture are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent:

{{quote|text=In reviewing the scarce unpublished and published materials on bugchasing, as well as general healthcare speculations, a common theme appears — the lumping of bug chasers with barebackers.... Although these two groups share some of the same practices, namely unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), there are distinctions that differentiate bug chasing...even though all bug chasers are indeed barebackers, not all barebackers are bugchasers.&lt;ref name="pmid17612955"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moskowitz DA, Roloff ME |title=The existence of a bug chasing subculture |journal=Cult Health Sex |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17612955 |doi=10.1080/13691050600976296 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13691050600976296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In simple terms, bugchasers engage in unprotected intercourse, and seek out partners with HIV, because they desire infection. Barebackers engage in unprotected intercourse because they prefer the sensation of it but generally prefer to avoid contracting STIs. While actual activity is the same for both groups the two do not share the same psychology. Barebackers conceptually have the same motivation as heterosexual couples that use non-barrier methods of birth control (more enjoyable sex), and, in contrast with bugchasers, do not deliberately seek HIV-infected partners.

As many "bugchasers" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with [[Munchausen syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Dr Mark|title=Contract Killing: A brief look at ‘bug chasing’|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201410/contract-killing|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.Gauthier|first=Deann|last2=J.Forsyth|first2=Craig|date=1999-01-01|title=bareback sex, bug chasers, and the gift of death|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016396299266605|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=20|issue=1|pages=85–100|doi=10.1080/016396299266605|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew [[condom]]s and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV.

Dr. Richard Tewksbury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewksbury|first=Richard|date=2003-09-01|title=bareback sex and the quest for HIV: assessing the relationship in internet personal advertisements of men who have sex with men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713840245|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=467–482|doi=10.1080/713840245|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the [[Internet]] to assist their [[Seroconversion|seroconversive]] efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics.

Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bug Chasing and Gift Giving: The Potential for HIV Transmission Among Barebackers on the Internet|last1=Grov|first1=Christian|last2=Parsons|first2=Jeffrey T.|date=2006|doi=10.1521/aeap.2006.18.6.490|journal=AIDS Education and Prevention|volume=18|issue=6|pp=490–503|pmid=17166076}}&lt;/ref&gt; research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers.

# "The Committed Bug Chaser" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent [[anal sex|anal receptive]]). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers.
# "The Opportunistic Bug Chaser" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner’s HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning [[anal receptive]] and [[anal insertive]]) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers.
# "The Committed Gift Giver" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category.
# "The Opportunistic Gift Giver" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner’s status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample.
# "The Serosorter" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their [[User profile|Internet profile]], behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were [[serosorting]] for partners of similar HIV status.
# "The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample.

In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers.

Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely [[sex addict]]s. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk-oriented high.

Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Exploratory Study of  Bug Chasers|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20321517|journal=Sociological imagination|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1077-5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge "common sense" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens.  Few respondents identified "getting it over with" as a motivating factor.

Some limited identification of becoming part of the "community" or "brotherhood" was identified.  Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical response==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Bugchasing has, more recently, been taken more seriously by medical health promotion bodies, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control]], which hosted a workshop on the topic, hosted by Dr. Michael Graydon of [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa]], at the 2004 National [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] Prevention Conference.

==In mainstream media==
The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304003441/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|archivedate=2008-03-04|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|title=In Search of Death|author=Gregory A. Freeman|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 December 2009|date=23 January 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Roeper&gt;{{Cite news| title = What makes bug chasers, gift givers do such a thing? | first = Richard | last = Roeper | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2003-04-22 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya&gt;{{Cite news| title = A new generation rethinks AIDS risk | page = 1D |department=Island Life | newspaper = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 2003-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but ''Rolling Stone'' stands behind the story.&lt;ref name = Roeper/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = n TRANSMISSION |journal= AIDS Policy and Law |volume= 18 |issue= 4 | date = 2003-03-03 | publisher = LRP Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mnookin&gt;{{Cite news| title = Using 'Bug Chasers' | page = 10 | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | publisher = Newsweek | date = 2003-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's [[Fenway Health|Fenway Community Health]], was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bugged&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bugged Out Over AIDS Story | page = 10 | publisher = New York Post | date = 2003-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the statements "entirely a fabrication," but ''Rolling Stone'' also stood behind them.&lt;ref name = Bugged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated? | newspaper = Newsweek | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | date = 2003-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weinstein, then editor of the ''New York Blade'', an established gay newspaper, called the article "less than truthful" and attributed it to a ''Rolling Stone'' editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing "lad mag" who wished to make a sensation for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Steve | title = Chasing the bug chasers [editorial] | journal = Washington Blade | date = May 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the article, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] put out an action alert, calling its members to "PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Savage Love |department=Hot Spot | page = 171 | authorlink = Dan Savage | first = Dan | last = Savage | newspaper = The Village Voice | date = 2003-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Men Who Want AIDS | first = Matthew | last = Laza | pages = 21–24 | newspaper = The Spectator | date = 2003-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to cut down on its AIDS funding.&lt;ref name = Mnookin/&gt;

Writer/[[film director|director]] Daniel Bort made a [[2003 in film|2003]] short film  on the subject called ''Bugchaser'', which premièred at the 16th Annual [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in [[New York City|New York]] [[sex club]]s. In an interview with the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', he explained: ''"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way."'' At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Gift (2003 film)|The Gift]]'' by Louise Hogarth.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 [[BBC]] programme, ''I love being HIV+'', said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising.&lt;ref name="HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4895012.stm|title=HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? |accessdate=2008-07-06|publisher=BBC News|author=Richard Pendry   | date=2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, "Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy." The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, "The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, "There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asked Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience "the gift". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the NBC series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', Season 7, Episode 13, Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asked the HIV-negative patient if he is "bug chasing".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter [[Marc with a C]] has a song on the subject entitled "Chasing the Bug".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Co | location = Amsterdam New York New York, N.Y., U.S.A | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780444877307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] bring together a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to the economics of welfare. The core focus of the capability approach is on what individuals are able to do (i.e., capable of).

== Assessing capability ==

Initially, Sen argued for five components in assessing capability:
# The importance of real freedoms in the assessment of a person's advantage
# Individual differences in the ability to transform resources into valuable activities
# The multi-variate nature of activities giving rise to happiness
# A balance of materialistic and nonmaterialistic factors in evaluating human welfare
# Concern for the distribution of opportunities within society

Subsequently, and in collaboration particularly with political philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], development economist Sudhir Anand and economic theorist James Foster, Sen has helped to make the capabilities approach predominant as a paradigm for policy debate in human development where it inspired the creation of the UN's [[Human Development Index]] (a popular measure of human development, capturing capabilities in health, education, and income). In addition, the approach has been operationalised with a high income country focus by [[Paul Anand]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dowding | first1 = Keith  | last2 = Martin | first2 = Van Hees | last3 = Anand | first3 = Paul | last4 = Hunter | first4 = Graham | last5 = Carter | first5 = Ian | last6 = Guala | first6 = Francesco | author-link1 = Keith Dowding | author-link2 = Martin van Hees | title = The development of capability indicators | journal = Journal of Human Development and Capabilities | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–152 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/14649880802675366 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880802675366 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Anand | first1 = Paul | last2 = Santos | first2 = Cristina | last3 = Smith | first3 = Ron | contribution = The measurement of capabilities | editor-last1 = Basu | editor-first1 = Kaushik | editor-last2 = Kanbur | editor-first2 = Ravi | editor-link1 = Kaushik Basu | editor-link2 = Ravi Kanbur | title = Arguments for a better world: essays in honor of Amartya Sen | volume = 1 | pages = 283–310 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199239115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since the creation of the [[Human Development and Capability Association]] in the early 2000s, the approach has been much discussed by political theorists, philosophers, and a range of social scientists, including those with a particular interest in human health.

The approach emphasizes functional capabilities ("substantive freedoms", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities); these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value, instead of [[utility]] ([[happiness]], desire-fulfillment or [[choice]]) or access to resources ([[income]], commodities, [[asset]]s). Poverty is understood as capability-deprivation. It is noteworthy that the emphasis is not only on how humans actually function but also on their having the capability, which is a practical choice, "to achieve outcomes that they value and have reason to value".&lt;ref name = Sen1999_291&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | page = 291 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone could be deprived of such capabilities in many ways, e.g. by ignorance, government oppression, lack of financial resources, or false consciousness.

This approach to human [[well-being]] emphasizes the importance of freedom of choice, individual heterogeneity and the multi-dimensional nature of welfare. In significant respects, the approach is consistent with the handling of choice within conventional [[microeconomics]] [[consumer theory]], although its conceptual foundations enable it to acknowledge the existence of claims, like rights, which normatively dominate utility-based claims (see {{harvnb|Sen|1979}}).

== Key terms ==

=== Functionings ===
In the most basic sense, functionings consist of "beings and doings".&lt;ref name=Sen1992&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Inequality reexamined | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation Clarendon Press Oxford Univ. Press | location = New York Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198289289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, living may be seen as a set of interrelated functionings. Essentially, functionings are the states and activities constitutive of a person's being. Examples of functionings can vary from elementary things, such as being healthy, having a good job, and being safe, to more complex states, such as being happy, having self-respect, and being calm. Moreover, Amartya Sen contends that functionings are crucial to an adequate understanding of the capability approach; capability is conceptualized as a reflection of the freedom to achieve valuable functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

In other words, functionings are the subjects of the capabilities referred to in the approach: what we are capable, want to be capable, or should be capable to be and/or do. Therefore, a person's chosen combination of functionings, what they are and do, is part of their overall capability set — the functionings they were able to do. Yet, functionings can also be conceptualized in a way that signifies an individual's capabilities. [[Eating]], [[starving]], and [[fasting]] would all be considered functionings, but the functioning of fasting differs significantly from that of starving because fasting, unlike starving, involves a choice and is understood as choosing to starve despite the presence of other options.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;  Consequently, an understanding of what constitutes functionings is inherently tied together with an understanding of capabilities, as defined by this approach.

=== Capabilities ===
Capabilities are the alternative combinations of functionings that are feasible for a person to achieve. Formulations of capability have two parts: functionings and opportunity freedom — the substantive freedom to pursue different functioning combinations.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009&gt;{{Citation | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | contribution = The human development and capability approach | editor-last1 = Deneulin | editor-first1 = Séverine | editor-last2 = Shahani | editor-first2 = Lila | editor-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | pages = 22–48 | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844078066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, capabilities denote a person's opportunity and ability to generate valuable outcomes, taking into account relevant personal characteristics and external factors. The important part of this definition is the "freedom to achieve", because if freedom had only [[instrumental value]] (valuable as a means to achieve an end) and no [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] (valuable in and of itself) to a person's well-being, then the value of the capability set as a whole would simply be defined by the value of a person's actual combination of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; Such a definition would not acknowledge the entirety of what a person is capable of doing and their resulting current state due to the nature of the options available to them. Consequently, the capability set outlined by this approach is not merely concerned with achievements; rather, freedom of [[choice]], in and of itself, is of direct importance to a person's [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For example, the difference between [[fasting]] and [[starving]], on person's well-being, is whether the person is choosing not to eat.&lt;ref name=Sen1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya | author-link = Amartya Sen | title = Development as freedom | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780192893307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the functioning is starving but the capability to obtain an adequate amount of food is the key element in evaluating well-being between individuals in the two states. In sum, having a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is not the same as choosing it; well-being depends on how that lifestyle came to be.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt; More formally, while the combination of a person's functionings represents their actual achievements, their capability set represents their opportunity freedom — their freedom to choose between alternative combinations of functionings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

An extension of the capabilities approach was published in 2013 in ''Freedom, Responsibility and Economics of the Person''. This book explores the interconnected concepts of person, responsibility and freedom in economics, moral philosophy and politics.  It tries to reconcile the rationality and morality of individuals. It presents a methodological reflection (phenomenology ''versus'' Kantian thought) with the aim to re-humanise the person, through actions, and through the values and norms that lead to corresponding rights and obligations that must be ordered. The book extends the capabilities approach in a critical form. In particular, it considers freedom in relation to responsibility, that is, the capacity of people to apply moral constraints to themselves. By contrast, Sen's capability approach considers freedom as a purely functional rationality of choice.

=== Agency ===
Amartya Sen defines an agent as someone who acts and brings about change, whose achievement can be evaluated in terms of his or her own [[values]] and goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; This differs from a common use of the term "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]" sometimes used in [[economics]] and [[game theory]] to mean a person acting on someone else's behalf.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt; Agency depends on the ability to personally choose the functionings one values, a choice that may not correlate with personal well-being. For example, when a person chooses to engage in [[fasting]], they are exercising their ability to pursue a goal they value, though such a choice may not positively affect [[physical well-being]]. Sen explains that a person as an agent need not be guided by a pursuit of well-being; agency achievement considers a person's success in terms of their pursuit of the whole of their goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1992/&gt;

For the purposes of the capability approach, agency primarily refers to a person's role as a member of [[society]], with the ability to participate in economic, social, and political actions. Therefore, agency is crucial in assessing one's capabilities and any economic, social, or political barriers to one's achieving substantive freedoms. Concern for agency stresses that [[participation (decision making)|participation]], public debate, [[democracy|democratic]] practice, and [[empowerment]], should be fostered alongside well-being.&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Alkire | first = Sabina | author-link = Sabina Alkire | title = Capability and functionings: definition &amp; justification | journal = HDCA Introductory Briefing Note | publisher = Human Development and Capability Association (HDCA) | date = 2005 | url = https://hd-ca.org/publications/capability-and-functionings-definition-justification | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sabina Alkire|Alkire]] and [[Séverine Deneulin|Deneulin]] pointed out that agency goes together with the expansion of valuable freedoms. That is, in order to be agents of their lives, people need the freedom to be educated, speak in public without fear, express themselves, associate, etc.; conversely, people can establish such an environment by being agents.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; In summary, the agency aspect is important in assessing what a person can do in line with his or her conception of the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crocker | first = David A | contribution = Functioning and capability: the foundations of Sen's and Nussbaum's development ethic | editor-last1 = Nussbaum | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = Glover | editor-first2 = Jonathan | editor-link1 = Martha Nussbaum | editor-link2 = Jonathan Glover | pages = 153–199 | title = Women, culture, and development: a study of human capabilities | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780198289647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nussbaum's central capabilities ==
Nussbaum (2000) frames these basic principles in terms of 10 capabilities, i.e. real opportunities based on personal and social circumstance. She claims that a political order can only be considered as being decent if this order secures at least a threshold level of these 10 capabilities to all inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha|title=Creating Capabilities The Human Development Approach|date=March 2011|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=9780674050549|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum's capabilities approach is centered around the notion of individual human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Nussbaum's contention that the goal of the capabilities approach is to produce capabilities for each and every person, the capabilities below belong to individual persons, rather than to groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674072350|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capabilities approach has been very influential in development policy where it has shaped the evolution of the human development index ([[Human Development Index|HDI]]), has been much discussed in philosophy, and is increasingly influential in a range of social sciences.

More recently, the approach has been criticized for being grounded in the liberal notion of freedom:

{{cquote| This is a fundamentally reductive view of the human condition. Moreover, the emphasis on freedom betrays a profoundly modern orientation. The compound problem is that freedom in Nussbaum’s hands is both given an intrinsic and primary value (a reductive claim), and, at the same time, the list is treated as a contingent negotiated relation in tension with other virtues such as justice, equality and rights. Both propositions cannot hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2018 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Creating Capacities for Human Flourishing: An Alternative Approach to Human Development | title= Cultures of Sustainability and Wellbeing: Theories, Histories, Policies | editor= Paola Spinozzi and Mazzanti Massimiliano | url= https://www.academia.edu/36899596/Creating_Capacities_for_Human_Flourishing_An_Alternative_Approach_to_Human_Development | publisher= Routledge | page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The core capabilities Nussbaum argues should be supported by all democracies are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=0674072359|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nussbaum did not claim her list as definite and unchanging, she strongly advocated for outlining a list of central human capabilities.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Capabilities as fundamental entitlements: Sen and social justice | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 9 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 33–59 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/1354570022000077926 | date = 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1354570022000077926 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Sen refuses to supply a specific list of capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sen argues that an exact list and weights would be too difficult to define. For one, it requires specifying the context of use of capabilities, which could vary. Also, Sen argues that part of the richness of the capabilities approach is its insistence on the need for open valuational scrutiny for making social judgments. He is disinclined to in any way devalue the domain of reasoning in the [[public sphere]]. Instead, Sen argues that the task of weighing various capabilities should be left to the ethical and political considerations of each society based on public reasoning.&lt;ref name="Sen2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Sen |first= Amartya |author-link= Amartya Sen |title= Human rights and capabilities |journal= Journal of Human Development |volume= 6 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–166 |publisher= Taylor and Francis |doi= 10.1080/14649880500120491 |date= 2005 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880500120491 |ref= harv |postscript = .}} [http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Human_Rights_and_Capabilities.pdf Pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with concerns raised about Nussbaum's list, Alkire and Black also argue that Nussbaum's methodology "runs counter to an essential thrust of the capabilities approach which has been the attempt to redirect development theory away from a reductive focus on a minimally decent life towards a more holistic account of human well-being for all people."&lt;ref name=Alkire2005a/&gt;

That said, applications to development are discussed in Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2000), and Clark (2002, 2005), and are now numerous to the point where the capabilities approach is widely accepted as a paradigm in development. The programme of work operationalising the capability approach by Anand and colleagues draws heavily on Nussbaum's list as a relatively comprehensive, high-level account of the space in which human well-being or life quality is experienced. This work argues that the subitems on Nussbaum's list are too distinct to be monitored by single question and that a dashboard of some 40-50 indicators is required to inform the development of empirical work.

== Measurement of capabilities ==
The measurement of capabilities was, in the early days, thought to be a particular barrier to the implementation and use of the approach. However, two particular lines of work, in research and policy have sought to show that meaningful indicators of what individuals (and in some cases governments) are able to do can be developed and used to generate a range of insights.

In 1990, the UN Human Development report published the first such exercise which focused on health, education and [[income]] which were equally weighted to generate the [[Human Development Index]]. At the same time, and subsequently, researchers recognizing that these three areas covered only certain elements of life quality have sought to develop more comprehensive measures. A major project in this area has been the 'capabilities measurement project' in which Anand has led teams of philosophers, economists and social scientists to generate that gives a full and direct implement of the approach drawing particular on the key relations and concepts developed in Sen (1985) but also on work to do with the content of the approach. The earliest work in this project developed a set of around 50 capability indicators which were used to develop a picture of quality of life and deprivation in the UK. Subsequently, Anand and colleagues have developed datasets for the USA, UK and Italy in which all the elements of Sen's framework are reflected in data which permits all three key equations, for functionings, experience and capabilities, to be estimated.

In a series of papers, they have shown that both their primary data and some secondary datasets can be used to shed light on the production and distribution of life quality for working age adults, those in retirement, very young children, those vulnerable to domestic violence, [[Human migration|migrants]], excluded traveler communities and the disabled. They use these applications to argue that the capability framework is a particularly good fit for understanding quality of life across the life course and that it provides a relatively universal grammar for understanding the elements of human [[well-being]].

===Monetary vs. non-monetary measures of well-being===
[[Monetary]] and non-monetary measures of well-being are ideal when used to complement each other.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;  Understanding the various aspects of economic development process not only helps address issues of inequality and lags in human development, but also helps to pinpoint where countries lag, which once addressed can further promote well-being and advancement.  As the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) (2006) notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Well-being has several dimensions of which monetary factors are only one. They are nevertheless an important one, since richer economies are better placed to create and maintain other well-being-enhancing conditions, such as a [[clean environment]], the likelihood that the average person will have a right to 10 years or more of education, and lead a comparatively [[longevity|long]] and healthy life. Well-being will also be increased by institutions that enable citizens to feel that they control their own lives, and that investment of their time and resources will be rewarded. In turn, this will lead to higher incomes in a [[virtuous circle]].&lt;ref name=OECD2006&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Alternative measures of well-being | editor-last1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | editor-first1 = OECD | editor-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  | title = Economic policy reforms: going for growth 2006 | pages = 129–142 | doi = 10.1787/growth-2006-en  | publisher = OECD | location = Paris | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789264035911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Simon Kuznets]], the developer of GNP, cautioned against using the measure as an indicator of overall welfare, which speaks to the unintended use of output-based measures as indicators of human welfare.

====Critique of output-based measures====
The use of GDP and GNP as an approximation of well-being and development have been critiqued widely, because they are often misused as indicators of well-being and human development when in fact they are only telling about the economic capacity of a country or an average income level when expressed on a per person basis. In particular, [[feminist economics]] and [[environmental economics]] offer a number of critiques. Critics in these fields typically discuss gender inequalities, insufficient representation of environmental costs of productions and general issues of misusing an output-based measure for unintended purposes.  In sum, the conclusion of Capabilities Approach is that people do not just value monetary income, and that development is linked to various indicators of [[life satisfaction]] and hence are important in measuring well-being. Development policies strive to create an environment for people to live long, healthy creative lives.&lt;ref name=Anand2009Fest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Martha Nussbaum | title = Creating capabilities | medium = Video | publisher = YouTube | location = Harvard | date = 19 May 2011 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoD-cjduM40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;
 
''Feminist critiques''

Nussbaum highlights some of the problematic assumptions and conclusions of output-based approaches to development.  First, she notes that GNP and GDP do not consider special requirements to help the most vulnerable, such as women.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004&gt;{{Citation | last = Nussbaum  | first = Martha | author-link= Martha Nussbaum | contribution = Promoting women's capabilities | editor-last1 = Benería | editor-first1 = Lourdes | editor-last2 = Bisnath | editor-first2 = Savitri | editor-link1 = Lourdes Benería | title = Global tensions: challenges and opportunities in the world economy | pages = 200–214 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415934411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Nussbaum mentions that output-based approaches ignore the distribution of needs for the varying circumstances of people, for example a pregnant woman needs more resources than a non-pregnant woman or a single man.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt;

Also, output-based measures ignore [[unpaid work]], which includes child rearing and the societal advantages that result from a mother's work.  [[Marilyn Waring]], a political economist and activist for women's rights, elaborates on the example of a mother engaged in child care, domestic care and producing few goods for the informal market, all of which are usually done simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Waring2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Waring | first = Marilyn | author-link = Marilyn Waring | title = Counting for something!

''Environmental critiques''

Another critique by Waring is that the output-based measures ignore negative effects of economic growth&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Terre Nash | title = Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics |medium = Motion picture | publisher = National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Studio B  | location = Canada | date = 1995 | url = https://www.nfb.ca/film/whos_counting/ }} See ''[[Who's Counting? Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt; and so commodities that lower social welfare, such as nuclear weapons, and oil extraction which causes spills, are considered a good input. The "anti-bads" or the defensive expenditures to fight "bads" are not counted as a deduction in accounting systems (p.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;ref name=Waringfilm1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waring2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanton2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Elizabeth A|title=The human development index: a history|date=February 2007|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute - PERI, University of Massachusetts Amherst|location=Massachusetts|id=Working paper no. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, natural resources are treated as limitless and negative outputs such as pollution and associated health risks, are not deducted from the measures.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

''Technical and misinterpretation critiques''

When GNP and GDP were developed, their intended use was not for measuring human well-being; the intended use was as an indicator of economic growth, and that does not necessarily translate into human well-being.&lt;ref name=OECD2006/&gt; Kuznets has often made this point, in his words, "distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | first = OECD | author-link1 = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | title = The well-being of nations: the role of human and social capital | page = 9 | publisher = Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development | location = Paris | year = 2001  | website = www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/40/33703702.pdf | isbn = 9789264185890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points out that GNP and GDP omit income distribution and the opportunity or ability to turn resources into activities (this critique stems directly from Capabilities Approach).&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2004/&gt; Kuznets terms this as a problem of "obtaining an unduplicated total of all output", (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kuznets | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Kuznets | title = Measurement of economic growth | journal = The Journal of Economic History | volume = 7 | issue = s1 | pages = 10–34 | publisher = Cambridge Journals | doi = 10.1017/S0022050700065190 | date = January 1947 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022050700065190 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that people are only seen as consumers and not as potential producers, hence any products purchased by an individual are not seen as "being consumed in the productive process of turning out other goods" (p.&amp;nbsp;15)&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt;

These accounting measures also fail to capture all forms of work and only focus on "engagement in work 'for pay or profit{{'"}}, (p.&amp;nbsp;133)&lt;ref name=Beneria2003&gt;{{Citation | last = Benería  | first = Lourdes  | author-link = Lourdes Benería | contribution = Paid and unpaid labor: meanings and debates | editor-last = Benería | editor-first = Lourdes | editor-link = Lourdes Benería | title = Gender, development, and globalization: economics as if all people mattered | pages = 131–160 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415927079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving out contributions to a society and economy, like volunteer work and subsistence farming. Kuznets provides the example of the process by which farmers devote time and energy to bringing virgin land into cultivation.&lt;ref name=Kuznets1947/&gt; Furthermore, GNP and GDP only account for monetary exchanges, and place no value on some important intangibles such as leisure time.&lt;ref name=Stanton2007/&gt;

===Shift to alternative measures===
Capabilities Approach has been highly influential thus far in human development theories and valuational methods of capturing capabilities,&lt;ref name=Anand2009_125/&gt; the theory has led to the creation of the HDI, IHDI and GII and their uses among international organizations such as the United Nations and others. In companies, capabilities are included in [[Key Development Indicator]]s, or KDIs as measures of development, including employee development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aubrey|first1=Bob|title=The Measure of Man: Leading Human Development|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 in the [[Human Development Report]] (HDR)commissioned by the UNDP set out to create a distribution-sensitive development measure.&lt;ref name="Reforming"&gt;{{Cite journal |  last1= Klasen |first1= Stephan | last2 = Schüler | first2 = Dana | title = Reforming the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure: implementing some specific proposals | journal = Feminist Economics| volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13545701.2010.541860 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was created to rival the more traditional metrics of GDP and GNP, which had previously been used to measure level of development in a given country, but which did not contain provisions for terms of distribution.&lt;ref name="Gender"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klasen |first=Stephan |title= UNDP's gender-related measures: some conceptual problems and possible solutions |journal=Journal of Human Development - special issue, Revisiting the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=243–274 |doi=10.1080/14649880600768595  |date=2006 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880600768595 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting measure was entitled the Human Development Index, created by Mahbub ul Haq in collaboration with Sen and others.  The purpose was to create an indicator of human development, especially one that would provide a general assessment and critique of global human development to shed light on persistent inequality, poverty and other capability deprivations despite high levels of GDP growth.&lt;ref name=Sen2005/&gt;

Currently the HDI continues to be used in the Human Development Report in addition to many other measures (based on theoretical perspectives of Capabilities) that have been developed and used by the United Nations.  Among these indices are the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), introduced in 1995, and the more recent [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII) and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), both adopted in 2010.

===Capabilities-based indices===
The following are a few of the major indices that were created based on the theoretical grounds of Capabilities Approach.

====Human development index====

The [[Human Development Index]] takes into consideration a number of development and well-being factors that are not taken into account in the calculation of GDP and GNP. The Human Development Index is calculated using the indicators of life expectancy, adult literacy, school enrollment, and logarithmic transformations of per-capita income.&lt;ref name=Reforming/&gt; Moreover, it is noted that the HDI "is a weighted average of income adjusted for distributions and purchasing power, life expectancy, literacy and health" (p.&amp;nbsp;16)&lt;ref name=Schischka2002&gt;{{Citation | last = Schischka | first = John | chapter = The capabilities approach as a metric for economic development: an application in Nepal | title = Conference proceedings - promoting women's capabilities, examining Nussbaum's capabilities approach | place = von Hügel Institute, St Edmund's College, Cambridge | publisher = The Pennsylvania State University CiteSeerX Archives | date = 9–10 September 2002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.197.7649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDI is calculated for individual countries with a value between 0 and 1 and is "interpreted...as the ultimate development that has been attained by that nation" (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name=Schischka2002/&gt; Currently, the 2011 Human Development Report also includes the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index which accounts for exactly the same things that the HDI considers however the IHDI has all three dimensions (long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living) adjusted for inequalities in the distribution of each dimension across the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Statistical annex: technical notes - technical note 2: calculating the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2011: sustainability and equity: a better future for all | page = 169 | publisher = United Nations Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York Basingstoke | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780230363311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender-related development index====

The [[Gender-related Development Index]] is defined as a "distribution-sensitive measure that accounts for the human development impact of existing gender gaps in the three components of the HDI" (p.&amp;nbsp;243).&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; In this way, the GDI accounts for shortcomings in the HDI in terms of gender, because it re-evaluates a country's score in the three areas of the HDI based on perceived gender gaps, and penalizes the score of the country if, indeed, large gender disparities in those areas exist. This index is used in unison with the HDI and therefore also captures the elements of capabilities that the HDI holds. In addition, it considers women's capabilities which has been a focus in much of Sen's and Nussbaum's work (to list a few: Nussbaum, 2004a; Nussbaum, 2004b; Sen, 2001; Sen, 1990.)

====Gender empowerment measure====

The [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) is considerably more specialized than the GDI. The GEM focuses particularly on the relative empowerment of women in a given country.&lt;ref name=Gender/&gt; The empowerment of women is measured by evaluating women's employment in high-ranking economic positions, seats in parliament, and share of household income. Notably this measurement captures more of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities, such as, Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment.

====Gender inequality index====

In the 2013 Human Development Report the Gender Inequality Index, which was introduced in 2011, continues to adjust the GDI and the GEM. This composite measurement uses three dimensions: [[reproductive health]], empowerment, and labor force participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Chapter 1: The state of human development (progress of nations, equity and human development): Gender and women's status | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development report 2013: the rise of the South: human progress in a diverse world | page = 31 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2013 | isbn = 9789211263404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When constructing the index the following criteria were key: conceptual relevance to definitions of human development and theory; Non-ambiguity so that the index is easily interpreted; Reliability of data that is standardized and collected/processed by a trustworthy organization; No redundancy found in other indicators; and lastly Power of discrimination, where distribution is well distinguished among countries and there is no "bunching" among top and bottom countries (p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Gaye | first1 = Amie | last2 = Klugman | first2 = Jeni | last3 = Kovacevic | first3 = Milorad | last4 = Twigg | first4 = Sarah | last5 = Zambrano | first5 = Eduardo| author-link2 = Jeni Klugman | contribution = 3: Introducing the gender inequality index - 3.1: Selection of dimensions and indicators | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme  | title = Human development research paper 2010/46 - Measuring key disparities in human development: the gender inequality index | pages = 9–10 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This index also captures some of Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities (Senses, Imagination and Thought; Affiliation; and Control Over Ones Environment).

====Other measures====

In 1997, the UNDP introduced the Human Poverty Index  (HPI), which is aimed at measuring poverty in both industrialized and developing countries. The HPI is a "nonincome-based" measure of poverty (p.&amp;nbsp;100) which focuses on "human outcomes in terms of choices and opportunities that a person faces" (p.&amp;nbsp;99).&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fukuda-Parr | first1 = Sakiko | author-link = Sakiko Fukuda-Parr | title = What does feminization of poverty mean? It isn't just lack of income | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–103 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/135457099337996 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135457099337996 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this index, [[Sakiko Fukuda-Parr]]—a development economist and past Director of The Human Development Report Office—differentiates between income poverty and human poverty.  Human poverty can be interpreted as deprivations to lead a long healthy and creative life with a decent standard of living.&lt;ref name=Fukuda-Parr1999/&gt;

=== Economic evaluation in health care ===
The capability approach is being developed and increasingly applied in [[health economics]], for use in [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]. It is seen as an alternative to existing preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (for example the [[EQ-5D]]) that focus on functioning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Welfarism, extra-welfarism and capability: The spread of ideas in health economics|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795360800333X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2008-10-01|pages = 1190–1198|volume = 67|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.06.027|first = Joanna|last = Coast|first2 = Richard D.|last2 = Smith|first3 = Paula|last3 = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Choice of Outcome Measure in an Economic Evaluation: A Potential Role for the Capability Approach|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|journal = PharmacoEconomics|date = 2015-04-11|issn = 1170-7690|pages = 849–855|volume = 33|issue = 8|doi = 10.1007/s40273-015-0275-x|language = en|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be applied within the framework of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = QALYs and the capability approach|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.975/abstract|journal = Health Economics|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1099-1050|pages = 817–829|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1002/hec.975|language = en|first = Richard|last = Cookson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of measures have been created for use in particular contexts such as older people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing quality of life among British older people using the ICEPOP CAPability (ICECAP-O) measure|journal = Applied Health Economics and Health Policy|date = 2011-09-01|issn = 1179-1896|pmid = 21875162|pages = 317–329|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.2165/11594150-000000000-00000|first = Terry N.|last = Flynn|first2 = Phil|last2 = Chan|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Coast|first4 = Tim J.|last4 = Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; public health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Operationalising the capability approach as an outcome measure in public health: The development of the OCAP-18|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361530054X|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 68–81|volume = 142|doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.002|first = Paula K.|last = Lorgelly|first2 = Karen|last2 = Lorimer|first3 = Elisabeth A.

===Alternative measures of well-being===

As noted above, to a great extent, Nussbaum's Central Human Capabilities address issues of equality, political freedom, creativity and the right to the self, as do the various indices that are based on capabilities.  It is evident that these measures are very subjective, but this fact is in the essence of defining quality of life according to Nussbaum and Sen. Nussbaum refers to Sen in saying that, although measures of well-being may be problematic in comparative, quantifiable models due to their subjective matter, the protection of and commitment to human development are too important of matters to be left on the sidelines of economic progress.  Well-being and quality of life are too important to be left without intentional focus towards political change.&lt;ref name= Nussbaum2003/&gt;

Measures such as the HDI, GDI, GEM, GII, IHDI and the like are crucial in targeting issues of well-being and indicators of quality of life. Anand, et al. (2009) can be summarized as demonstrating that it is possible to measure capabilities within the conventions applied to standard household survey design, contrary to earlier doubts about the ability to operationalise the capabilities approach.

== Contrast with other approaches ==

===Utility-based or subjective approaches ===
Much of conventional [[welfare economics]] today is grounded in a [[utilitarian]] approach according to the classical Benthamite form of [[utilitarianism]], in which the most desirable action is the one that best increases peoples' psychological [[happiness]] or satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009/&gt; The "[[utility]]" of a person stands for some measure of his or her [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]]. Some merits associated with this approach to measuring well-being are that it recognizes the importance of taking account of the results of social arrangements in judging them and the need to pay attention to the well-being of the people involved when judging social arrangements and their results.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;  Amartya Sen, however, argues this view has three main deficiencies: distributional indifference, neglect of [[rights]], [[freedoms]] and other non-utility concerns, and adaptation and mental conditioning.&lt;ref name=Sen1999/&gt;

Distributional indifference refers to a utilitarian indifference between different the distributions of utility, so long as the sum total is the same (note that the utilitarian is indifferent to the distribution of happiness, not income or wealth - the utilitarian approach would generally prefer, all else being equal, more materially equal societies assuming [[diminishing marginal utility]]). Sen argues that we may "want to pay attention not just to "aggregate" magnitudes, but also to extents of inequalities in happiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Development as freedom|date=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0385720274|page=62|edition= 1st Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen also argues that while the [[utilitarian]] approach attaches no [[intrinsic value (ethics)]] to claims of rights and freedoms, some people value these things independently of their contribution to utility.

Lastly, Amartya Sen makes the argument that the [[utilitarian]] view of individual well-being can be easily swayed by mental conditioning and peoples' happiness adapting to [[oppressive]] situations. The [[utility calculus]] can essentially be unfair to those who have come to terms with their deprivation as a means for survival, adjusting their desires and expectations. The capability approach, on the other hand, doesn't fall victim to these same criticisms because it acknowledges inequalities by focusing on equalizing people's capabilities, not happiness, it stresses the intrinsic importance of rights and freedoms when evaluating well-being, and it avoids overlooking deprivation  by focusing on capabilities and opportunities, not state of mind.

=== Resource-based approaches ===
Another common approach in conventional economics, in [[economic policy]] and judging development, has traditionally been to focus on [[income]] and [[resources]]. These sorts of approaches to development focus on increasing resources, such as assets, property rights, or basic needs.&lt;ref name=Alkire2009 /&gt; However, measuring resources is fundamentally different from measuring functionings, such as the case in which people don't have the capability to use their resources in the means they see fit. Arguably, the main difficulty in a resource- or income-based approach to well-being lies in personal heterogeneities, namely the diversity of human beings.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

Different amounts of income are needed for different individuals to enjoy similar capabilities, such as an individual with severe [[disabilities]] whose treatment to ensure the fulfillment of basic capabilities may require dramatically more income compared to an able-bodied person. All sorts of differences, such as differences in age, gender, talents, etc. can make two people have extremely divergent opportunities of [[quality of life]], even when equipped with exactly the same commodities. Additionally, other contingent circumstances which affect what an individual can make of a given set of resources include environmental diversities (in geographic sense), variations in social climate, differences in relational perspectives, and distribution within the family.&lt;ref name=Sen1999 /&gt;

The capability approach, however, seeks to consider all such circumstances when evaluating people's actual capabilities. Furthermore, there are things people value other than increased resources. In some cases, maximizing resources may even be objectionable. As was recognized in the 1990 [[Human Development Report]], the basic objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy, and creative lives. This end is often lost in the immediate concern with the accumulation of commodities and financial wealth that are only a means to expansion of capabilities. Overall, though resources and income have a profound effect on what we can or cannot do, the capability approach recognizes that they are not the only things to be considered when judging well-being, switching the focus from a means to a good life to the freedom to achieve actual improvements in lives, which one has reason to value.

'''Carroll University''' is located in Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA. Established in 1846, Carroll was Wisconsin's first four-year institution of higher learning. Carroll University is a private [[liberal arts college]] affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  Before July 1, 2008, Carroll University was known as '''Carroll College'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=749962|title=Carroll change approved|author=Scott Williams|work=jsonline.com|accessdate=3 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518125423/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=749962|archivedate=18 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to its establishment, Carroll was known as Prairieville Academy, which was founded in 1841. Its charter—named for [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]—was passed into law by the [[Wisconsin Territory#Legislature|Wisconsin Territorial Legislature]] on January 31, 1846.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} During the 1860s, the [[American Civil War]] and financial difficulty caused Carroll to temporarily suspend operations. The Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the institution's name to Carroll University, effective July 1, 2008.

== Academics ==
Carroll University offers more than 95 areas of study at the [[undergraduate]] level, with master's degrees and certificates in selected subjects, as well as one clinical doctorate program in physical therapy.

There are 133 full-time and 258 part-time faculty members. 71.4% of the faculty have terminal degrees. As of September 2015, Carroll serves 3,521 students at the full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate levels. These students represent 33 states and 31 countries.

==Campus==
The campus is home to a variety of nineteenth and early twentieth century historical buildings, including Sneeden House (a 1922 colonial home now used as a guesthouse and conference center) and MacAllister Hall (a renovated, 19th-century mansion that now houses offices for the CFO, English, modern language, computational and physical sciences, chemistry, and the Division of Arts and Sciences).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thedigitalnp.com/2010/10/26/macallister-history-haunts/ MacAllister: A History of Haunts]"&lt;/ref&gt; The school provides housing in six residence halls, six apartment buildings, and two houses.

The full campus stretches 132.8 acres, with the Main Campus around 50 acres, a four-acre Center for Graduate Studies located three minutes south of [[Interstate 94]], a six-acre property southwest of campus and a 64-acre field research station in [[Genesee, Wisconsin]].

==Traditions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

===Bagpipes===
Since the 1960s, bagpipes have been a part of Carroll’s opening convocation and commencement ceremony. Freshmen are escorted to their first assembly by a lone bagpiper, and upon graduation are led to commencement by a band of [[bagpipes]]. The rite of passage symbolizes Carroll’s connection to its [[Presbyterian]] roots; early 19th-century Scottish immigrants settled in Waukesha, then known as Prairieville.

===Ring the bell===
A longstanding Carroll sports tradition, “Ring the Bell” is a ceremony performed by Carroll varsity teams following a win, when members athletes ring the school victory bell located at the northwest corner of Schneider Stadium. All teams participate—football, soccer, lacrosse—as long as the game is played and won at Schneider. In 2016 the victory bell was repainted and updated to feature the new Carroll Pioneers logo.

== Athletics ==
Carroll University's athletic teams, known as the Pioneers, participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] and compete in 11 men's and 11 women's sports in the [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]].  Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Football===
: ''See [[List of Carroll Pioneers head football coaches]]''
The [[college football]] program at Carroll began in the late 1890s.  Past head coaches include [[Glenn Thistlethwaite]], [[Vince DiFrancesca]], and [[Matty Bell]].  The current coach is [[Mark Krzykowski]], who replaced [[Henny Hiemenz]] after the 2010 season.

On September 5, 1906, Carroll became the site of a milestone event in [[American football]] when [[Saint Louis University]] player [[Bradbury Robinson]], coached by [[Eddie Cochems]], threw the first legal [[forward pass]] in football history (though it was first used experimentally in the [[1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game]]).

===Basketball===
In 2006, both the men's and women's basketball teams qualified for the NCAA Division III tournament for the first time in school history. The women won the Midwest Conference tournament and received the automatic bid, while the men's team received an "at-large" bid. Both were eliminated in the first round of play.

In 2007, both teams again qualified for the tournament. The Pioneers won the Midwest Conference tournament, during which freak power outages forced the championship game to be delayed and moved twice, first to [[Monmouth College]], then to nearby [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. Upon reaching the NCAA tournament, they defeated 7th-ranked [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in the first round of play, and 5th-ranked [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], to advance to the "Sweet Sixteen" sectional level. The women received an at-large bid to the tournament, defeating [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] in the first round, but losing in the second round to 25th-ranked [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]].

In 2012, Carroll returned to the NCAA tournament, making it to the second round after defeating ranked [[Transylvania University]].

==Media==
* ''Century Magazine'', Carroll University's annual literary magazine, publishes art, photography, prose, and poetry created by Carroll students.
* ''[[The New Perspective]]'' is the official student-operated college newspaper.
* [[WCCX-FM]] is the official student-operated radio station.
* MWCTV is the official broadcast home for athletic events.

==Rankings==
In 2017, Carroll was ranked 38th in Midwest Regional Colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' on its list of America's Best Colleges.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/carroll-university-3838 | work=U.S.News &amp; World Report  | title=Regional University Rankings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Carroll #532 among 660 colleges in the United States.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/colleges/carroll-university/ America's Top Colleges Ranking 2015: Carroll University]". ''Forbes'', July 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also gave Carroll a B financial grade.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J. R.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">[[Image:Coleoptile.png|thumb|Schematic image of wheat coleoptile (above) and flag leaf (below).]]
'''Coleoptile''' is the pointed protective sheath covering the emerging shoot in [[monocotyledons]] such as grasses.  Coleoptiles have two vascular bundles, one on either side.  Unlike the flag leaves rolled up within, the pre-emergent coleoptile does not accumulate significant protochlorophyll or carotenoids, and so it is generally very pale.  Some preemergent coleoptiles do, however, accumulate purple anthocyanin pigments.

[[Coleoptiles]] consist of very similar cells that are all specialised to fast stretch growth. They do not divide, but increase in size as they accumulate more water. Coleoptiles also have water vessels (frequently two) along the axis to provide a water supply.

When a coleoptile reaches the surface, it stops growing and the flag leaves penetrate its top, continuing to grow along. The wheat coleoptile is most developed in the third day of the germination (if in the darkness).

==Tropisms==
Early experiments on [[phototropism]] using coleoptiles suggested that plants grow towards light because [[plant cell]]s on the darker side elongate more than those on the lighter side. In 1880 [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] found that coleoptiles only bend towards the light when their tips are exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. (1880). ''The Power of Movement in Plants''. London: Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the tips must contain the [[photoreceptor cell]]s although the bending takes place lower down on the shoot.  A chemical messenger or [[hormone]] called [[auxin]] moves down the dark side of the shoot and stimulates growth on that side. The natural [[plant hormone]] responsible for phototropism is now known to be [[indoleacetic acid]] (IAA).

The [[Cholodny–Went model]] is named after [[Frits Warmolt Went]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the Russian scientist [[N. Cholodny]], who reached the same conclusion independently in 1937. It describes the [[phototropism|phototropic]] and [[gravitropism|gravitropic]] properties of emerging shoots of [[monocotyledon]]s. The model proposes that auxin, a plant growth hormone, is synthesized in the coleoptile tip, which senses light or gravity and will send the auxin down the appropriate side of the shoot. This causes [[symmetry|asymmetric]] growth of one side of the plant. As a result, the plant shoot will begin to bend toward a light source or toward the surface.&lt;ref name="basipetal"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Plant Physiology| title=Basipetal Auxin Transport Is Required for Gravitropism in Roots of Arabidopsis| author=Rashotte|date=February 2000| volume=122| number=2| pages=481–490| doi=10.1104/pp.122.2.481|display-authors=etal| pmc=58885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleoptiles also exhibit strong [[geotropism|geotropic]] reaction, always growing upward and correcting direction after reorientation. Geotropic reaction is regulated by light (more exactly by [[phytochrome]] action).

A '''database dump''' (also: '''SQL dump''') contains a record of the [[Table (database)|table]] structure and/or the data from a [[database]] and is usually in the form of a list of [[SQL]] statements. A database dump is most often used for [[backup|backing up]] a database so that its contents can be restored in the event of [[data loss]]. [[Data corruption|Corrupted]] databases can often be recovered by analysis of the dump. Database dumps are often published by [[free software]] and [[free content]] projects, to allow reuse or [[Fork (software development)|forking]] of the database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6886">In [[systems analysis]], '''Diakoptics''' (Greek ''dia''&amp;ndash;through + ''kopto''&amp;ndash;cut,tear) or the "Method of Tearing" involves breaking a (usually physical) [[problem]] down into subproblems which can be solved independently before being joined back together to obtain an ''exact'' solution to the whole problem. The term was introduced by [[Gabriel Kron]] in a series "Diakoptics — The Piecewise Solution of Large-Scale Systems" published in [[London, England]] by ''The Electrical Journal'' between June 7, 1957 and February 1959. The twenty-one installments were collected and published as a [[book]] of the same title in 1963. The term ''diakoptics'' was coined by Philip Stanley of the [[Union College]] Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
According to Kron, "Diakoptics, or the Method of Tearing, is a combined theory of a pair of storehouses of information, namely equations+graph, or matrices+graph, associated with a given physical or economic system.".&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p 1&lt;/ref&gt; What Kron was saying here is that in order to carry out the Method of Tearing, not only were the system equations needed, but also the topology of the system.

Diakoptics was explained in terms of [[algebraic topology]] by J. Paul Roth.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Roth (1959) "An application of algebraic topology to numerical analysis: On the existence of a solution to the network problem", [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] 41(7):518&amp;ndash;21 {{MathSciNet|id=0074094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Roth (1959) "The validity of Kron’s method of tearing", ''PNAS'' 41(8):599&amp;ndash;600 {{MathSciNet|id=0074095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Roth (1959) "An application of algebraic topology: Kron’s method of tearing", ''Quarterly of Applied Mathematics'' 17:1&amp;ndash;24&lt;/ref&gt;
Roth describes how [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] in an [[electrical network]] with a given [[impedance matrix]] or [[admittance matrix]] can be solved for currents and voltages by using the [[topology (electrical circuits)|circuit topology]]. Roth translates Kron’s "orthogonality conditions" into [[exact sequence]]s of homology or cohomology. Roth’s interpretation is confirmed by [[Raoul Bott]] in reports in [[Mathematical Reviews]]. Roth says, "tearing consists essentially in deducing from the solution of one (easier to solve) network K&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt; the solution of a network K having the same number of branches as K&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;  and having the same isomorphism L between the groups of 1-chains and 1-cochains."
 
Diakoptics can be seen applied for instance in the text ''Solution of Large Networks by Matrix Methods''.&lt;ref&gt;Homer E. Brown (1974, 1985) ''Solution of Large Networks by Matrix Methods'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] {{ISBN|0-471-80074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diakoptics is peculiar as a decomposition method, in that it involves taking values on the "intersection layer" (the boundary between subsystems) into account. The method has been rediscovered by the parallel processing community under the name "[[Domain decomposition methods|Domain Decomposition]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lai C. H. (1994) "Diakoptics, Domain Decomposition and Parallel Computing",  [[The Computer Journal]], Vol 37, No 10, pp.&amp;nbsp;840–846&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Keith Bowden, "Kron was undoubtedly searching for an ontology of engineering".&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1998) "Physical computation and parallelism (constructive postmodern physics)", [[International Journal of General Systems]] 27(1–3):93–103&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden also described "a multilevel hierarchical version of the method, in which the subsystems are recursively torn into subsubsystems".&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1991) "Hierarchical Tearing: An Efficient Holographic Algorithm for System Decomposition", ''International Journal of General Systems'' 24(1), pp 23–38&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[parallel computing]] was provided by the [[transputer]], Keith Bowden described how diakoptics might be applied.&lt;ref&gt;K. Bowden (1990) "Kron's Method of Tearing on a Transputer Array", ''The Computer Journal'' 33(5):453–459&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ongoing open question how the parallelism of Quantum Computing may be relevant.

==Japan==
In 1951 "a group of about twenty scientists and engineers was organized in Japan for the unifying study of basic problems in engineering sciences by means of geometry….reorganized in 1954 into a new organization called the Research Association of Applied Geometry (RAAG)."&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Kondo (1973) "An Oriental Expansion of Kron’s Science beyond Electrical Engineering", pp 153&amp;ndash;64 in ''Gabriel Kron and Systems Theory'', H.H. Happ editor, Union College Press {{oclc|613720}} {{ISBN|978-0-912156-02-6}}, see p 154&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kron was...the first charter member from overseas. He remained an Honorary Member until he passed away. Meanwhile, the RAAG membership roll has been increased to two hundred and fifty, distributed throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Kondo 1973 p 159&lt;/ref&gt;
Many articles on diakoptics, by Kron and others, were published in the ''Memoirs'' of RAAG.

The journal ''Tensor'' ({{ISSN|0040-3504}}), published in [[Sapporo, Japan]], placed Kron on its "honorary editorial board" in 1951. He contributed an article to the March 1955 issue.

==United Kingdom==
"Kron’s influence extends far beyond the U.S.A. The Tensor Society of Great Britain came into being to further the understanding and applications of tensor analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Happ 1973 p 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 it was founded by S. Austen Stigant&lt;ref&gt;Kron 1963 p xvii&lt;/ref&gt; as The Tensor Club of Great Britain, and began publishing ''Matrix and Tensor Quarterly'' ({{ISSN|0025-5998}}). According to Kron, it was S. Austen Stigant that first suggested Kron write his serial "Diakoptics" for the ''Electrical Journal''. In September 1961 the Club became a Society. In 1968 (volume 19) the ''Quarterly'' published a commemorative issue to note the death of Gabriel Kron. The ''Quarterly'' continued publishing until 1987.

"C.H. Flurscheim and J.R. Mortlock of Associated Electrical Industries Ltd. [encouraged] the Power Systems Engineering Department of that company to investigate the applications of Diakoptics to the solution of practical load-flow problems and some difficult mechanical vibration problems; investigations which yielded results of considerable value."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Brameller &amp; D. W. Mortifee (1973) "The influence of Gabriel Kron in the United Kingdom", pp 143 to 151 in ''Gabriel Kron and Systems Theory''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''engineering design process''' is a methodical series of steps that engineers use in creating functional products and processes. The process is highly [[iterative]] - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary.

{{quote|…It is a [[decision making]] process (often iterative) in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective.  Among the fundamental elements of the [[design process]] are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation.|[[ABET]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.unlv.edu/Undergraduate/coursenotes/meg497/ABETdefinition.htm|title=ABET Definition of Design: "Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs|author=|date=|website=www.me.unlv.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The steps tend to get articulated, subdivided, and/or illustrated in different ways, but they generally reflect certain core principles regarding the underlying concepts and their respective sequence and interrelationship.

==Common Stages of the Engineering Design Process==

One framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages: ''research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and production''.&lt;ref name="refB"&gt;Ertas, A. &amp; Jones, J. (1996). The Engineering Design Process. 2nd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, noting that "different authors (in both research literature and in textbooks) define different phases of the design process with varying activities occurring within them," have suggested more simplified/generalized models - such as ''problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, and design communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Dym, C.L. &amp; Little, P. (2009). Engineering Design. 3rd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A standard summary of the process in European engineering design literature is that of ''clarification of the task, conceptual design, embodiment design, detail design''.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl, G. &amp; Beitz, W. (1988). Engineering Design: a systematic approach. London, UK, The Design Council.&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, other key aspects - such as concept evaluation and prototyping - are subsets and/or extensions of one or more of the listed steps. It's also important to understand that in these as well as other articulations of the process, different terminology employed may have varying degrees of overlap, which affects what steps get stated explicitly or deemed "high level" versus subordinate in any given model.

===Research===
Various stages of the design process (and even earlier) can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and [[research]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A.Eide, R.Jenison, L.Mashaw, L.Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The source of information should be relevant, including existing solutions.  [[Reverse engineering]] can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Other sources of information include the Internet, local [[libraries]], available government documents, personal organizations, [[trade journal]]s, vendor catalogs and individual [[experts]] available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Design requirements===
Establishing design [[requirements]] and conducting [[requirement analysis]], sometimes termed '''problem definition''' (or deemed a related activity), is one of the most important elements in the design process,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136.&lt;/ref&gt; and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed, throughout the engineering design process. These include basic things like the functions, attributes, and [[specification]]s - determined after assessing user needs. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, [[maintainability]], [[availability]], and [[testability]].&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Feasibility===
In some cases, a [[feasibility study]] is carried out after which schedules, resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed. The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of [[decision making]]. It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome. The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario.
A feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed.

The purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the [[design phase]].  This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within [[cost accounting|cost constraint]]s. It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Conceptualization===
A concept study ([[conceptualization]], [[conceptual design]]) is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas. This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error, manage costs, [[risk assessment|assess risks]], and evaluate the potential success of the intended project. In any event, once an engineering issue or problem is defined, potential solutions must be identified.  These solutions can be found by using [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]], the mental process by which ideas are generated. In fact, this step is often termed '''Ideation''' or "Concept Generation." The following are widely used techniques:&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

*trigger word - a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated, and subsequent words and phrases are evoked.  
*[[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] - independent design characteristics are listed in a chart, and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution.  Normally, a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart.
*[[synectics]] - the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks, "What would I do if I were the system?"  This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand. The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis. Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way. Synthesis creative process is present in every design.
*[[brainstorming]] - this popular method involves thinking of different ideas, typically as part of a small group, and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem

Various generated ideas must then undergo a '''concept evaluation''' step, which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives.

===Preliminary design===
The preliminary design, or high-level design includes  (also called [[Front-end engineering|FEED]]), often bridges a gap between design conception and detailed design, particularly in cases where the level of conceptualization achieved during ideation is not sufficient for full evaluation. So in this task, the overall system configuration is defined, and [[schematic]]s, [[diagram]]s, and [[:wikt:layout|layout]]s of the project may provide early project configuration. (This notably varies a lot by field, industry, and product.) During detailed design and optimization, the parameters of the part being created will change, but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

S. Blanchard and J. Fabrycky describe it as:
“The ‘whats’ initiating conceptual design produce ‘hows’ from the conceptual design evaluation effort applied to feasible conceptual design concepts. Next, the ‘hows’ are taken into preliminary design through the means of allocated requirements. There they become ‘whats’ and drive preliminary design to address ‘hows’ at this lower level.”

===Detailed design===
Following FEED is the Detailed Design (Detailed Engineering) phase, which may consist of [[procurement]] of materials as well.
This phase further elaborates each aspect of the project/product by complete description through [[solid modeling]], [[drawings]] as well as [[specification]]s.

===Design for manufacturability=== 
[[Design for manufacturability]] (DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

*Operating parameters
*Operating and nonoperating environmental stimuli
*Test requirements
*External dimensions
*Maintenance and testability provisions
*Materials requirements
*[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] requirements
*External surface treatment
*Design life
*[[Packaging]] requirements
*External marking

[[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs have made detailed design phase more efficient.  For example, a CAD program can provide [[optimization]] to reduce volume without hindering a part's quality.  It can also calculate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] using the [[finite element method]] to determine stresses throughout the part. &lt;ref name="refC"&gt;Widas, P. (1997, April 9). Introduction to finite element analysis. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514233218/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production planning===
The [[production planning]] and tool design consists of planning how to [[mass-produce]] the product and which tools should be used in the [[manufacturing]] process.  Tasks to complete in this step include selecting materials, selection of the production processes, determination of the sequence of operations, and selection of tools such as jigs, fixtures, metal cutting and metal or plastics forming tools.  This task also involves additional [[prototype testing]] iterations to ensure the mass-produced version meets [[qualification testing]] standards.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

==Comparison with the Scientific Method==
Engineering is formulating a problem that can be solved through design. Science is formulating a question that can be solved through investigation. 
The engineering design process bears some similarity to the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_TSMC_Design_Process.pdf The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998).

The key difference between the engineering process and the scientific process is that the engineering process focuses on [[design]], [[creativity]] and [[innovation]] while the scientific process emphasizes [[Discovery (observation)]].

In [[machine learning]], particularly in the creation of [[artificial neural networks]], '''ensemble averaging''' is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Frequently an ensemble of models performs better than any individual model, because the various errors of the models "average out."

== Overview ==
Ensemble averaging is one of the simplest types of [[committee machine]]s. Along with [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], it is one of the two major types of static committee machines.&lt;ref name="haykin"&gt;Haykin, Simon. Neural networks : a comprehensive foundation. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River  N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to standard network design in which many networks are generated but only one is kept, ensemble averaging keeps the less satisfactory networks around, but with less weight.&lt;ref name="hashem"&gt;Hashem, S. "Optimal linear combinations of neural networks." Neural Networks 10, no. 4 (1997): 599&amp;ndash;614.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of ensemble averaging relies on two properties of artificial neural networks:&lt;ref name="naft"&gt;Naftaly, U., N. Intrator, and D. Horn. "Optimal ensemble averaging of neural networks." Network: Computation in Neural Systems 8, no. 3 (1997): 283&amp;ndash;296.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In any network, the bias can be reduced at the cost of increased variance
# In a group of networks, the variance can be reduced at no cost to bias

Ensemble averaging creates a group of networks, each with low bias and high variance, then combines them to a new network with (hopefully) low bias and low variance. It is thus a resolution of the [[bias-variance dilemma]].&lt;ref name="geman"&gt;Geman, S., E. Bienenstock, and R. Doursat. "Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma." Neural computation 4, no. 1 (1992): 1&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of combining experts has been traced back to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemen, R. T. "Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography." International Journal of Forecasting 5, no. 4 (1989): 559&amp;ndash;583.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The theory mentioned above gives an obvious strategy: create a set of experts with low bias and high variance, and then average them. Generally, what this means is to create a set of experts with varying parameters; frequently, these are the initial synaptic weights, although other factors (such as the learning rate, momentum etc.) may be varied as well. Some authors recommend against varying weight decay and early stopping.&lt;ref name="naft" /&gt; The steps are therefore:
# Generate ''N'' experts, each with their own initial values. (Initial values are usually chosen randomly from a distribution.)
# Train each expert separately.
# Combine the experts and average their values.
Alternatively, [[domain knowledge]] may be used to generate several ''classes'' of experts. An expert from each class is trained, and then combined.

A more complex version of ensemble average views the final result not as a mere average of all the experts, but rather as a weighted sum. If each expert is &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, then the overall result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\alpha}) = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \alpha_j y_j(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of weights. The optimization problem of finding alpha is readily solved through neural networks, hence a "meta-network" where each "neuron" is in fact an entire neural network can be trained, and the synaptic weights of the final network is the weight applied to each expert. This is known as a ''linear combination of experts''.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

It can be seen that most forms of neural networks are some subset of a linear combination: the standard neural net (where only one expert is used) is simply a linear combination with all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j = 0&lt;/math&gt; and one &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=1&lt;/math&gt;. A raw average is where all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal to some constant value, namely one over the total number of experts.&lt;ref name="hashem" /&gt;

A more recent ensemble averaging method is negative correlation learning,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Liu and X.

:''This article deals with explanatory power in the context of the philosophy of science. For a statistical measure of explanatory power, see [[coefficient of determination]] or [[mean squared prediction error]].''

'''Explanatory power''' is the ability of a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] to effectively explain the subject matter it pertains to. The opposite of explanatory power is ''explanatory impotence''.

In the past, various criteria or measures for explanatory power have been proposed. In particular, one hypothesis, theory, or explanation can be said to have more explanatory power than another about the same subject matter

* if more facts or observations are accounted for;
* if it changes more "surprising facts"  into "a matter of course" (following [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce]]);
* if more details of causal relations are provided, leading to a high [[accuracy and precision]] of the description;
* if it offers greater [[predictive power]], i.e., if it offers more details about what we should expect to see, and what we should not;
* if it depends less on authorities and more on observations;
* if it makes fewer assumptions;
* if it is more [[falsifiable]], i.e., more testable by observation or experiment (following [[Karl Popper|Popper]]).

Recently, [[David Deutsch]] proposed that theorists should seek explanations that are ''hard to vary''.

By this expression he intends to state that a hard to vary explanation provides specific details which fit together so tightly that it is impossible to change any one detail without affecting the whole theory. 

==Overview==
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|right|Deutsch says that the truth consists of detailed and "hard to vary assertions about reality"]]Philosopher and physicist [[David Deutsch]] offers a criterion for a good explanation that he says may be just as important to scientific progress as learning to reject [[argument from authority|appeals to authority]], and adopting formal [[empiricism]] and [[falsifiability]]. To Deutsch, these aspects of a good explanation, and more, are contained in any theory that is specific and "hard to vary". He believes that this criterion helps eliminate "bad explanations" which continuously add [[Ad hoc hypotheses|justifications]], and can otherwise avoid ever being truly falsified.&lt;ref name=DeutschTED&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation.html David Deutsch, "A new way of explaining explanation"]&lt;/ref&gt;  An explanation that is hard to vary but does not survive a critical test can be considered falsified.&lt;ref name=DeutschTED&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation.html David Deutsch, "A new way of explaining explanation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Deutsch takes examples from [[Greek mythology]]. He describes how very specific, and even somewhat falsifiable theories were provided to explain how [[Demeter|the gods']] sadness caused the seasons. Alternatively, Deutsch points out, one could have just as easily explained the seasons as resulting from the gods' happiness - making it a bad explanation because it is so easy to arbitrarily change details.&lt;ref name=DeutschTED/&gt; Without Deutsch's criterion, the 'Greek gods explanation' could have just kept adding justifications. This same criterion, of being ''"hard to vary"'', may be what makes the modern explanation for the [[seasons]] a good one: none of the details - about the earth rotating around the sun at a certain angle in a certain orbit - can be easily modified without changing the theory's coherence.&lt;ref name=DeutschTED/&gt;

==Relation to other criteria==
It can be argued that the criterion ''hard to vary'' is closely related to [[Occam's razor]]: both imply logical consistency and a minimum of assumptions.

The philosopher Karl Popper acknowledged it is logically possible to avoid falsification of a hypothesis by changing details to avoid any criticism, adopting the term an ''[[immunizing stratagem]]'' from [[Hans Albert]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray S. Percival (2012), ''The Myth of the Closed Mind: Explaining why and how People are Rational'', p.206, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper argued that scientific hypotheses should be subjected to methodological testing to select for the strongest hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1934), ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'', p.20, Routledge Classics (ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fault tree.svg|thumb|A fault tree diagram]]

'''Fault tree analysis''' ('''FTA''') is a top-down, [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using [[Boolean logic]] to combine a series of lower-level events. This analysis method is mainly used in the fields of [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] to understand how systems can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce risk or to determine (or get a feeling for) event rates of a safety accident or a particular system level (functional) failure. FTA is used in the [[aerospace]],&lt;ref name="NASA SE Toolbox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldberg|first1=B.

In aerospace, the more general term "system failure condition" is used for the "undesired state" / top event of the fault tree. These conditions are classified by the severity of their effects. The most severe conditions require the most extensive fault tree analysis. These system failure conditions and their classification are often previously determined in the functional [[hazard analysis]].

== Usage ==
Fault tree analysis can be used to:

* understand the logic leading to the top event / undesired state.
* show compliance with the (input) system safety / reliability requirements.
* prioritize the contributors leading to the top event- creating the critical equipment/parts/events lists for different importance measures
* monitor and control the safety performance of the [[complex system]] (e.g., is a particular aircraft safe to fly when fuel valve ''x'' malfunctions? For how long is it allowed to fly with the valve malfunction?).
* minimize and optimize resources.
* assist in designing a system. The FTA can be used as a design tool that helps to create (output / lower level) requirements.
* function as a diagnostic tool to identify and correct causes of the top event. It can help with the creation of diagnostic manuals / processes.

==History==
Fault tree analysis (FTA) was originally developed in 1962 at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] by H.A. Watson, under a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[526th ICBM Systems Group|Ballistics Systems Division]] contract to evaluate the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman I]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) Launch Control System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1970, the [[FAA|U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) published a change to 14 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 25.1309 [[airworthiness]] regulations for [[transport category]] [[aircraft]] in the [[Federal Register]] at 35 FR 5665 (1970-04-08). This change adopted failure probability criteria for [[aircraft systems]] and equipment and led to widespread use of FTA in civil aviation. In 1998, the FAA published Order 8040.4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ASY-300|title=Safety Risk Management|date=June 26, 1998|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/directives/ND/ND8040-4.pdf|id=8040.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing risk management policy including hazard analysis in a range of critical activities beyond aircraft certification, including [[air traffic control]] and modernization of the U.S. [[National Airspace System]]. This led to the publication of the FAA System Safety Handbook, which describes the use of FTA in various types of formal hazard analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=FAA|title=System Safety Handbook|date=December 30, 2000|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/risk_management/ss_handbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the Apollo project the question was asked about the probability of successfully sending astronauts to the moon and returning them safely to Earth. A risk, or reliability, calculation of some sort was performed and the result was a mission success probability that was unacceptably low. This result discouraged NASA from further quantitative risk or reliability analysis until after the ''Challenger'' accident in 1986. Instead, NASA decided to rely on the use of [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)]] and other qualitative methods for system safety assessments. After the ''Challenger'' accident, the importance of [[probabilistic risk assessment]] (PRA) and FTA in systems risk and reliability analysis was realized and its use at NASA has begun to grow and now FTA is considered as one of the most important system reliability and safety analysis techniques.&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;{{cite book

Within the nuclear power industry, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] began using PRA methods including FTA in 1975, and significantly expanded PRA research following the 1979 incident at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Following process industry disasters such as the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] and 1988 [[Piper Alpha]] explosion, in 1992 the [[United States Department of Labor]] [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) published in the Federal Register at 57 FR 6356 (1992-02-24) its [[Process Safety Management]] (PSM) standard in 19 CFR 1910.119.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA PSM recognizes FTA as an acceptable method for [[process hazard analysis]] (PHA).

Today FTA is widely used in [[system safety]] and [[reliability engineering]], and in all major fields of engineering.

==Methodology==
FTA methodology is described in several industry and government standards, including NRC NUREG&amp;ndash;0492 for the nuclear power industry, an aerospace-oriented revision to NUREG&amp;ndash;0492 for use by [[NASA]],&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] [[ARP4761]] for civil aerospace, MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;338 for military systems, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard IEC&amp;nbsp;61025&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Any sufficiently complex system is subject to failure as a result of one or more subsystems failing.  The likelihood of failure, however, can often be reduced through improved system design. Fault tree analysis maps the relationship between faults, subsystems, and redundant safety design elements by creating a logic diagram of the overall system.

The undesired outcome is taken as the root ('top event') of a tree of logic. For instance the undesired outcome of a metal stamping press operation is a human appendage being stamped.  Working backward from this top event we might determine there are two ways this could happen:  during normal operation or during maintenance operation. This condition is a logical OR.  Considering the branch of occurring during normal operation perhaps we determine there are two ways this could happen: the press cycles and harms the operator or the press cycles and harms another person. This is another logical OR.  We can make a design improvement by requiring the operator to press two buttons to cycle the machine—this is a safety feature in the form of a logical AND.  The button may have an intrinsic failure rate—this becomes a fault stimulus we can analyze.  When fault trees are labeled with actual numbers for failure probabilities, [[computer programs]] can calculate failure probabilities from fault trees. 
When a specific event is found to have more than one effect event, i.e. it has impact on several subsystems, it is called a common cause or common mode. Graphically speaking, it means this event will appear at several locations in the tree. Common causes introduce dependency relations between events. The probability computations of a tree which contains some common causes are much more complicated than regular trees where all events are considered as independent. Not all software tools available on the market provide such capability.

The tree is usually written out using conventional [[logic gate]] symbols. A cut set is a combination of events, typically component failures, causing the top event. If no event can be removed from a cut set without causing the top event, then it is called a minimal cut set.

Some industries use both fault trees and [[event tree]]s (see [[Probabilistic Risk Assessment]]). An event tree starts from an undesired initiator (loss of critical supply, component failure etc.) and follows possible further system events through to a series of final consequences. As each new event is considered, a new node on the tree is added with a split of probabilities of taking either branch. The probabilities of a range of 'top events' arising from the initial event can then be seen.

Classic programs include the [[Electric Power Research Institute]]'s (EPRI) CAFTA software, which is used by many of the US nuclear power plants and by a majority of US and international aerospace manufacturers, and the [[Idaho National Laboratory]]'s [[SAPHIRE]], which is used by the U.S. Government to evaluate the safety and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of [[nuclear reactor]]s, the [[Space Shuttle]], and the [[International Space Station]]. Outside the US, the software RiskSpectrum is a popular tool for fault tree and event tree analysis, and is licensed for use at almost half of the world's nuclear power plants for probabilistic safety assessment. Professional-grade [[free software]] is also widely available; SCRAM&lt;ref&gt;[https://scram-pra.org SCRAM]&lt;/ref&gt; is an open-source tool that implements the Open-PSA Model Exchange Format&lt;ref&gt;[https://open-psa.github.io/mef Open-PSA Model Exchange Format]&lt;/ref&gt; open standard for probabilistic safety assessment applications.

==Graphic symbols==
The basic symbols used in FTA are grouped as events, gates, and transfer symbols. Minor variations may be used in FTA software.

===Event symbols===
Event symbols are used for ''primary events'' and ''intermediate events''. Primary events are not further developed on the fault tree. Intermediate events are found at the output of a gate. The event symbols are shown below:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_basic_event.jpg|Basic event
File:FTA_initiating_event.jpg|External event
File:FTA_undeveloped_event.jpg|Undeveloped event
File:FTA_conditioning_event.jpg|Conditioning event
File:FTA_intermediate_event.jpg|Intermediate event
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The primary event symbols are typically used as follows:
* '''Basic event''' - failure or error in a system component or element (example: switch stuck in open position)
* '''External event''' - normally expected to occur (not of itself a fault)
* '''Undeveloped event''' - an event about which insufficient information is available, or which is of no consequence
* '''Conditioning event''' - conditions that restrict or affect logic gates (example: mode of operation in effect)
An intermediate event gate can be used immediately above a primary event to provide more room to type the event description.

FTA is a top-to-bottom approach.

===Gate symbols===
Gate symbols describe the relationship between input and output events. The symbols are derived from Boolean logic symbols:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_OR_gate.jpg|OR gate
File:FTA_AND_gate.jpg|AND gate
File:FTA_XOR_gate.jpg|Exclusive OR gate
File:FTA_priority_AND_gate.jpg|Priority AND gate
File:FTA_inhibit_gate.jpg|Inhibit gate
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The gates work as follows:
* '''OR gate''' - the output occurs if any input occurs.
* '''AND gate''' - the output occurs only if all inputs occur (inputs are independent).
* '''Exclusive OR gate''' - the output occurs if exactly one input occurs.
* '''Priority AND gate''' - the output occurs if the inputs occur in a specific sequence specified by a conditioning event.
* '''Inhibit gate''' - the output occurs if the input occurs under an enabling condition specified by a conditioning event.

===Transfer symbols===
Transfer symbols are used to connect the inputs and outputs of related fault trees, such as the fault tree of a subsystem to its system. NASA prepared a complete document about FTA through practical incidents.&lt;ref name=fthbaa&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:FTA_transfer_in.jpg|Transfer in
File:FTA_transfer_out.jpg|Transfer out
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Basic mathematical foundation==
Events in a fault tree are associated with [[Statistics|statistical]] [[probability theory|probabilities]]. For example, component failures may typically occur at some constant [[failure rate]] λ (a constant hazard function). In this simplest case, failure probability depends on the rate λ and the exposure time t:
:P = 1 - exp(-λt)
:P ≈ λt, λt &lt; 0.1

A fault tree is often normalized to a given time interval, such as a flight hour or an average mission time. Event probabilities depend on the relationship of the event hazard function to this interval.

Unlike conventional [[logic gate]] diagrams in which inputs and outputs hold the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] values of TRUE (1) or FALSE (0), the gates in a fault tree output probabilities related to the [[Algebra of sets|set operations]] of [[Boolean logic]]. The probability of a gate's output event depends on the input event probabilities.

An AND gate represents a combination of [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] events. That is, the probability of any input event to an AND gate is unaffected by any other input event to the same gate. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms, this is equivalent to the intersection of the input event sets, and the probability of the AND gate output is given by:
:P (A and B) = P (A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B)

An OR gate, on the other hand, corresponds to set union:
:P (A or B) = P (A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P (A ∩ B)

Since failure probabilities on fault trees tend to be small (less than .01), P (A ∩ B) usually becomes a very small error term, and the output of an OR gate may be conservatively approximated by using an assumption that the inputs are [[mutually exclusive events]]:
:P (A or B) ≈ P(A) + P(B), P (A ∩ B) ≈ 0

An exclusive OR gate with two inputs represents the probability that one or the other input, but not both, occurs:
:P (A xor B) = P(A) + P(B) - 2P (A ∩ B)

Again, since P (A ∩ B) usually becomes a very small error term, the exclusive OR gate has limited value in a fault tree.

==Analysis==
Many different approaches can be used to model a FTA, but the most common and popular way can be summarized in a few steps. A single fault tree is used to analyze one and only one undesired event or top event, which may be subsequently fed into another fault tree as a basic event. Though the nature of the undesired event may vary dramatically, a FTA follows the same procedure for any undesired event; be it a delay of 0.25&amp;nbsp;ms for the generation of electrical power, an undetected cargo bay fire, or the random, unintended launch of an [[ICBM]]. Due to labor cost, FTA is normally only performed for more serious undesired events.

FTA analysis involves five steps:
# Define the undesired event to study.
#* Definition of the undesired event can be very hard to catch, although some of the events are very easy and obvious to observe. An engineer with a wide knowledge of the design of the system or a system analyst with an engineering background is the best person who can help define and number the undesired events. Undesired events are used then to make the FTA, one event for one FTA; no two events will be used to make one FTA.
# Obtain an understanding of the system.
#* Once the undesired event is selected, all causes with probabilities of affecting the undesired event of 0 or more are studied and analyzed. Getting exact numbers for the probabilities leading to the event is usually impossible for the reason that it may be very costly and time consuming to do so. Computer software is used to study probabilities; this may lead to less costly system analysis.&lt;br /&gt; System analysts can help with understanding the overall system. System designers have full knowledge of the system and this knowledge is very important for not missing any cause affecting the undesired event. For the selected event all causes are then numbered and sequenced in the order of occurrence and then are used for the next step which is drawing or constructing the fault tree. &lt;!-- These two paragraphs could do with some copyediting to trim them down. --&gt;
# Construct the fault tree.
#* After selecting the undesired event and having analyzed the system so that we know all the causing effects (and if possible their probabilities) we can now construct the fault tree. Fault tree is based on AND and OR gates which define the major characteristics of the fault tree.
# Evaluate the fault tree.
#* After the fault tree has been assembled for a specific undesired event, it is evaluated and analyzed for any possible improvement or in other words study the risk management and find ways for system improvement. A wide range of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This step is as an introduction for the final step which will be to control the hazards identified. In short, in this step we identify all possible hazards affecting the system in a direct or indirect way.
# Control the hazards identified.
#* This step is very specific and differs largely from one system to another, but the main point will always be that after identifying the hazards all possible methods are pursued to decrease the probability of occurrence.

==Comparison with other analytical methods==
FTA is a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], top-down method aimed at analyzing the effects of initiating faults and events on a complex system. This contrasts with [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), which is an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], bottom-up analysis method aimed at analyzing the effects of single component or function failures on equipment or subsystems. FTA is very good at showing how resistant a system is to single or multiple initiating faults. It is not good at finding all possible initiating faults. FMEA is good at exhaustively cataloging initiating faults, and identifying their local effects. It is not good at examining multiple failures or their effects at a system level. FTA considers external events, FMEA does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In civil aerospace the usual practice is to perform both FTA and FMEA, with a [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode effects summary]] (FMES) as the interface between FMEA and FTA.

Alternatives to FTA include [[Reliability block diagram|dependence diagram]] (DD), also known as [[reliability block diagram]] (RBD) and [[Markov analysis]]. A dependence diagram is equivalent to a success tree analysis (STA), the logical inverse of an FTA, and depicts the system using paths instead of gates. DD and STA produce probability of success (i.e., avoiding a top event) rather than probability of a top event.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do'''''' is a 2009 book by [[evolutionary biologist]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' [[Bestselling book|bestselling author]] [[Sharon Moalem]], published by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|title=How Sex Works|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1895544,00.html|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Jessica|title=Between the Covers|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/How-Sex-Works-by-Sharon-Moalem-Book-Review|publisher=Oprah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines the scientific reasons people are attracted to one another including the evolutionary underpinnings of [[sexual attraction]], [[monogamy]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCERPT: 'How Sex Works'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Books/story?id=7472408|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Lynn|title=Lynn Harris Reviews 'Behind the Bedroom Door,' 'How Sex Works,'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/21/AR2009072102755.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''How Sex Works'' uses [[evolutionary biology]] to explore human sexuality, and how sexuality can influence society in terms of human relations and belief systems. The author examines the physiological purpose behind how sensory data is interpreted by the human body and its effect on human sexuality.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW SEX WORKS Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sharon-moalem/how-sex-works/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moalem arguest that menstruation, fertility, penis size, orgasm, ejaculation and contraception all have traces back to the “[[survival of the fittest]]” and human's desire to find a healthy partner for reproduction.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Beast Recommends|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/04/28/the-daily-beast-recommends-7.html|publisher=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers other evolutionary factors influencing sexual attraction include pheremones, genetic makeup, immune system compatibility and ovulation.&lt;ref name=tbt&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Miller|first=Jen|title=Review: 'How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do,' by Dr. Sharon Moalem|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/review-how-sex-works-why-we-look-smell-taste-feel-and-act-the-way-we-do/1003125|publisher=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book uses various examples to illustrate the author's central point, including:&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;
* Body scents are linked to strength of immune systems, signaling potential mates on the viability of producing healthy offspring
* Brazilian waxes have become more desirable as our subconscious attempts to eradicate pubic lice
* Men watching pornography with other men in the shot (along with a female) can lead to increased sperm production due to the perceived competition
* Women are more likely to fantasize about men who aren't their partners during ovulation, more likely to lead to fraternal twins
* Men are attracted to women with low waist-to-hip ratio (hourglass shape) because fatty acids stored in hip fat aid brain development in fetuses and lead to smarter children

[[Kirkus Reviews]] called the book "provocative and entertaining" describing it as "a volume stuffed with information that avoids getting bogged down in difficult medical terms or complex biological concepts."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

[[File:IEEE_Bell_medal_scan_-front_-NO_COPYRIGHT_APPLIES-.jpg|thumb|275px|The '''IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal''', awarded for meritorious achievements in telecommunications. (Photo courtesy: '''''IEEE''''')]]

The '''IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal''' is an award honoring ''"exceptional contributions to the advancement of communications sciences and engineering"'' in the field of [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;  The medal is one of the highest honor awarded by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] for achievements in telecommunication sciences and engineering.

It was instituted in 1976 by the directors of the world's largest  professional society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), commemorating the centennial of the invention of the telephone by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The award is presented either to an individual, or to a team of two or three persons.&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/about/awards/medals/bell.html IEEE webpage: IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal], IEEE, Piscataway, N.J.  Retrieved June 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's reasoning for the award was described thus:
{{quote|The invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 was a major event in [[Electrical engineering technology|electrotechnology]]. It was instrumental in stimulating the broad telecommunications industry that has dramatically improved life throughout the world. As an individual, Bell himself exemplified the contributions that scientists and engineers have made to the betterment of mankind.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;}}

Recipients of the award receive a gold medal, bronze replica, certificate, and an [[honorarium]].&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

{{Inca civilization}}

==Hydraulic engineering==
{{See also|Incan aqueducts}}

The builders of the empire planned and built impressive waterworks in their city centers, including [[canal]]s, [[fountain]]s, [[drainage]] systems and expansive [[irrigation]]. Inca's infrastructure and [[water supply]] system have been hailed as “the pinnacle of the architectural and engineering works of the Inca civilization”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kenneth R. Wright |author2=Jonathan M. Kelly |author3=Alfredo Valencia Zegarra. | title=Machu Picchu: Ancient Hydraulic Engineering  | journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering | year=1997| volume=123 | issue=10 | pages= 838–843 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1997)123:10(838)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Inca centers were chosen by experts who decided the site, its apportionment, and the basic layout of the city. In many cities we see great hydraulic engineering marvels. For example, in the city of [[Tipón|Tipon]], 3 irrigation canals diverted water from Rio [[Pukara]] to [[Tipón|Tipon]] which is about 1.35&amp;nbsp;km north for Tipon's terraces.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|last=Mays|first=Larry|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-9048186310|location=New York|pages=188–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tipón|Tipon]] also had natural springs that they built fountains for that supplied noble residents with water for non agricultural purposes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==Machu Picchu==
In 1450, [[Machu Picchu]] was constructed.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.machupicchu.org/how_old_is_machu_picchu.htm|title=How Old is Machu Picchu|last=|first=|date=|website=Peru for Less|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date was determined and based off the [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon 14 test]] results.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The famous lost Inca city is an architectural remnant of a society whose understanding of civil and [[hydraulic engineering]] was advanced. Today, it is famously known for its remarkable preservation as well as the beauty of the building's architecture.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The site is located 120&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Cuzco in the Urubamba river valley, Peru.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;At  2560 m above sea level, sitting atop a mountain, the city planners had to consider the steep slopes of the site as well as the humid and rainy climate.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;  The Inca people built this site atop a hill which was terraced (most likely for agricultural purposes).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;  In addition to terraces, Machu Picchu is composed of two additional basic architectural elements; elite residential compounds and religious structures.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The site is full of staircases and sculpted rock, which were also important to their architecture and engineering practices.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;
[[File:99 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009.edit3.jpg|thumb|An example of Machu Picchu]]
Making models out of clay before beginning to build, the city planners remained consistent with Inca architecture and laid out a city that separated the agriculture and urban areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Before construction began the engineers had to assess the spring and whether it could provide for all of the city’s anticipated citizens.  After evaluating the water supply, the civil engineers designed a {{convert|2457|ft|m|adj=on}}-long [[canal]] to what would become the city’s center. The canal descends the mountain slope, enters the city walls, passes through the agricultural sector, then crosses the inner wall into the urban sector, where it feeds a series of fountains. The fountains are publicly accessible and partially enclosed by walls that are typically about 1.2 m high, except for the lowest fountain, which is a private fountain for the Temple of the Condor and has higher walls. At the head of each fountain, a cut stone conduit carries the water to a rectangular spout, which is shaped to create a jet of water suitable for filling aryballo–a typical Inca clay water jug. The water collects in a stone basin in the floor of the fountain, then enters a circular drain that delivers it to the approach channel for the next fountain.

The Incas built the canals on steady grades, using cut stones as the water channels.  Most citizens worked on the construction and maintenance of the canal and irrigation systems, bronze and [[stone tool|stone]] tools to complete the water-tight stone canals. The water then traveled through the channels into sixteen [[fountain]]s known as the "stairway of fountains", reserving the first water source for the [[emperor]].  This incredible feat supplied the population of Machu Picchu, which varied between 300 and 1000 people when the emperor was present, and also helped irrigate water to the farming steppes. The fountains and canal system were built so well that they would, after a few minor repairs, still work today.

To go along with the Incas' advanced water supply system, an equally impressive drainage system was built as well.  Machu Picchu contains nearly 130 outlets in the center that moved the water out of the city through walls and other structures.  The agriculture [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] are a feature of the complicated drainage system; the [[steppe]]s helped avoid erosion, and were built on a slope to aimed excess water into channels that ran alongside the stairways.  These channels carried the runoff into the main drain, avoiding the main water supply.  This carefully planned drainage system shows the Incas' concern and appreciation for clean water.  Water engineer Ken Wright and his archaeological team found the emperor’s [[bathing room]] complete with a separate [[Drain (plumbing)|drain]] that carried off his used bath water so it would never re-enter Machu Picchu’s water supply.

== Terraces ==

=== Terrace Function and Structure ===
The Inca faced many problems with living in areas with steep terrain. Two large issues were soil [[erosion]] and area to grow crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/terrace-cultivation|title=Terrace cultivation|website=britannica.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The solution to these problems were the development of terraces, called [[Anden]]es. These terraces allowed the Inca to utilize land for farming that they never could in the past.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Londoño|first=Ana|date=February 12, 2007|title=Pattern and rate of erosion inferred from Inca agricultural terraces in arid southern Peru|journal=Geomorphology|volume=99|pages=13|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything&amp;nbsp;about how the terrace function, looks, its geometric alignment, etc. all depend on the slope of the land.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The different layering of materials is part of what makes the terraces so successful. It starts with a base layer of large rocks. Followed by a second layer is smaller rocks. Then a layer of sand like material, and finally the top soil. You can practice this in a simulation [http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/activity/engineer-inka-terrace.html here].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/activity/engineer-inka-terrace.html|title=Engineering the Inka empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most impressive part of the terraces were their drainage systems. &amp;nbsp;Drain outlets placed in the numerous stone retaining walls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright, Valencia, Lorah|first=Kenneth, Alfedo, William|date=|title=Ancient Machu Picchu Drainage Engineering|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/machupicchu/machupicchu.pdf|journal=Waterhistory.org|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger rocks at base of each terrace level is what allowed the water to flow easier through the larger spaces in between the rocks eventually coming out at the “Main Drain”.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Inca even constructed different types of drainage channels that are used for different purposes throughout the city. &amp;nbsp;

=== How They Were Built and Why They Were Effective.  ===
Studies have indicated that when terraces like the ones in the Colca Valley were being constricted the first step was excavating  into the slope and the a subsequent infilling of the slope.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A retaining wall was built to hold the fill material.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This wall had many uses including absorbing heat from the sun during the day and radiated it back out at night, often keeping crops from freezing in the chilling nighttime temperatures and holding back the different layers of sediment. After the wall is built the larger rocks would be placed on the bottom, then smaller rocks, then sand, then soil.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Since the soil was now level, the water did not rush down the side of the mountain which is what causes erosion. Previously, this erosion was so powerful that it had potential to wipe out major areas of the Inca road as well as and wash away all of the nutrients and fertile soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/question/how-did-inka-control-erosion-and-grow-crops-steep-andes-terrain.html|title=How did the Inca control erosion and grow crops|last=|first=|date=June 26, 2010|website=Engineering the Inca empire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the soil never washed away, nutrients would always be added from previously grown crops year after year.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Inca even grew specific crops together to balance out the optimal amount of nutrients for all plants. For example,  a planting method known as "three sisters" incorporated the growth of corn, beans and squash in the same terrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/5-ancient-incan-inventions4.htm|title=Terrace Farming|last=Franco|first=Michael|date=|website=HowStuffWorks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the fixed nitrogen in the beans helped the corn grow while the squash acted as mulch keeping the soil moist and also acted as a weed repellant.

== Freeze -Drying ==

=== What to Freeze Dry and why? ===
A very common and well known Freeze dried item was the potato or when it was frozen, [[Chuño]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All food grown or killed by the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] could be [[Freeze-drying|freeze dried]]. Freeze drying is still very popular today. One of the biggest benefits for freeze drying is that it takes out all of the water and [[moisture]] but leaves all of the nutritious value.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inside-peru.com/inca-food.html|title=Inca Food and the Inca People|last=Unknown|first=|date=Not stated|website=inside peru.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water in meats and vegetables is what gives them a lot of their weight. This is what made it very popular for transportation purposes and storage because dried meats lasted twice as long as non freeze dried foods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vegetables- Potato

Inca diet was largely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] because large wild game were often reserved for special occasions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Meats- Llama, Alpaca, duck, guinea-pig&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transportation and storage of [[jerky]] Or 'charki' (the Inca name) was much easier to transport and lasted longer than not dried meats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These all had potential to be freeze dried.

==== How to Freeze dry ====
[[File:Chuño.jpg|thumb|Chuño]]
Both meats and vegetables went through a similar freezing process. They would start by laying all the different foods on rocks and during the cold nights in high [[altitude]]s with dry air they would freeze.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The next morning, a combination of the thin dry air and the heat from the sun would melt the ice and [[Evaporation|evaporate]] all the [[moisture]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The most important factor about this process and what made the Inca able to do this is the dry and [[google:rarefied&amp;oq=rarefied&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1614j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|rarefied]] atmosphere that they live in. A few different methods can be used for the last step which is take out the last of the moisture. The over arching idea is to compress the food to a point where it would expel the rest of its moisture.

The process of Freeze Drying was important for transportation and storage.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the high elevation of the [[Andes|Andes Montanan's]] the low temperatures is a huge factor of what allowed them to take advantage of this process.

== Pathway Systems ==
The vast size of the [[Inca Empire|Inca empire]] made it essential that efficient and effective transportation systems were created and built to assist in the exchanging of goods, services, people, etc. At one point, "their&amp;nbsp;(the [[Inca Empire|Inca) empire]] eventually extended across western South America from Quito in the north to Santiago in the south, making it the largest empire ever seen in the Americas and the largest in the world at that time (between c. 1400 and 1533 CE)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Civilization/|title=Inca Civilization|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=September 15, 2014|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to have "extended some 3500-4000 km along the mountainous backbone of South America."&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link-springer-com.muhlenberg.idm.oclc.org/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4615-0521-1_14.pdf|title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 7: South America|last=Peregrine|first=Peter|last2=Ember|first2=Melvin|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=150–193|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gridclub.com/subscribers/info/fact_gadget_2009/best_ever_qa/history/early_america/1678.html|title=Grid Club|last=powered by Google|first=|date=|website=Fact Gadget|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trails, roads, and bridges were designed not only to link the empire physically, but these structures also helped the empire to maintain communication.

=== &lt;u&gt;Rope Bridges&lt;/u&gt; ===

[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]] were an integral part of the [[Inca road system]]. "Five centuries ago, the [[Andes]] were strung with [[Inca rope bridge|suspension bridges]]. By some estimates there were as many as 200 of them."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2013/06/10/the_last_incan_suspension_bridge_is_made_entirely_of_grass_and_woven_by.html|title=The Last Incan Suspension Bridge Is Made Entirely of Grass and Woven by Hand|last=Obscura|first=Atlas|date=June 10, 2013|website=Slate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08bridg.html|title=How the Inca Leapt Canyons|last=Wilford|first=John|date=May 8, 2007|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pictured to the right, these structures were used to connect two land masses, allowing for the flow of ideas, goods, people, animals, etc. across the [[Inca Empire|Incan empire]].

==== ''Construction'' ====
Although these [[Inca Bridge|bridges]] were assembled using twisted mountain grass, other vegetation, and saplings, they were dependable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These structures were able to both support the weight of traveling people and animals as well as withstand weather conditions over certain amounts of time. Since grass rots away over time, the bridges had to be rebuilt every year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
[[File:2015 Smithsonian folklife festival DC -Qeswachaka Bridge rope making - 01.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Pictured is the weaving of grass into rope to be used in the formation of a bridge]]
When the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] people began building a [[Inca Bridge|grass suspension bridge]], they would first gather natural materials of grass and other vegetation. They would then braid these elements together into rope. This contribution was made by the Inca women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh5mYw3PNhs|title=Inca Bridge|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2011|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast amounts of thin-looking rope were produced.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The villagers would then deliver their quota of rope to the builders.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The rope was then divided into sections.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Each section consisted of an amount of thin rope being laid out together in preparation to create a thicker rope cord.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once the sections are laid out, the strands of rope made earlier are twisted together tightly and evenly, producing the larger and thicker rope cord.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These larger ropes are then braided together to create cables, some as thick as a human torso.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Depending on the dimensions of the cable, each could weigh up to 200 pounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These cables were then delivered to the bridge site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It was considered bad luck for women to be anywhere near the construction of the bridge, so the Inca men were therefore in charge of the on-site construction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the bridge site, a builder(s) would travel to the opposite land mass that they were working to connect.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once they were positioned on the opposite side, one of the thin, light-weight ropes would be thrown over to them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This rope would then be used to pull the main cables over the gorge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Stone beams were built on either side of the gorge and were used in helping to position and secure the cables.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cables were wrapped around these stone beams and tightened inch by inch to decrease any slack in the bridge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once this was finished, the riggers carefully made their way across the hanging cables, tying the foot-ropes together and connecting the handrails and the foot-ropes with the remainder of the thin grass ropes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Not all rope bridges were exactly alike in terms of design and build. Some riggers also wove pieces of wood into the foot-ropes.

Modern day rope bridge builders in Huinchiri, Peru make offerings to Pacha Mama, otherwise known as "Mother Earth," throughout their building process to ensure that the bridge will be strong and safe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2404inca.html|title=SECRETS OF LOST EMPIRES: INCA|last=|first=|date=February 11, 1997|website=PBS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a practice used by the Inca people since they too were religious. If all went smoothly and if tasks were performed in a timely fashion, a bridge had the potential of being constructed in three days.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== ''Modern Rope Bridges'' ====
[[File:IRB-7-MUDDY2.jpg|thumb|280x280px|An example of a rope bridge]]
People today continue to honor Incan traditions and expand their knowledge in the building of [[Inca rope bridge|rope bridges]].

1."Each June in&amp;nbsp;Huinchiri, Peru,&amp;nbsp;four&amp;nbsp;[[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities on two sides of a gorge&amp;nbsp;join together to build a bridge out of grass, creating a form of ancient infrastructure&amp;nbsp;that dates back at least five centuries to the&amp;nbsp;[[Inca Empire]]."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/281699/the-inca-rope-bridge-thats-woven-across-a-river-each-year/|title=The Inca Rope Bridge That’s Woven Across a River Each Year|last=Meier|first=Allison|date=March 31, 2016|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Q’eswachaka Bridge is cut down and swept away by the [[Apurímac River]] current and a new bridge is built in its place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://festival.si.edu/2015/peru/traditional-knowledge/qeswachaka-bridge/smithsonian|title=Q’ESWACHAKA BRIDGE|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Smithsonian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition links the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities of the Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Choccayhua, and Ccollana Quehue to their past ancestors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;''“According to our grandfathers, this bridge was built during the time of the Inkas 600 years ago, and on it they walked their [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s carrying their produce.”'' ''-'' Eleuterio Ccallo Tapia&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;2. "A small portion of a 60-foot replica built by [[Quechua people|Quechua]] weavers is on view in&amp;nbsp;''The Great Inka Road: Engineering an Empire&amp;nbsp;''at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian’s&amp;nbsp;National Museum]] of the American Indian in Washington, DC."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This exhibit will be on display at the museum through June 1, 2020.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/national-museum-american-indian/2017/08/05/qeswachaka-last-inka-suspension-bridge/|title=Q’eswachaka, the Last Inka Suspension Bridge|last=Plata|first=Allie|date=August 4, 2017|website=Smithsonian.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are also encouraged to experience this exhibit online.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Either way, museums like the Smithsonian are working to preserve and display examples and knowledge of the Inca inspired [[Inca rope bridge|rope bridges]] today.

3. &amp;nbsp;John Wilford shares in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are learning much more than how objects are made. They are being taught to observe and test how archeology entwines with culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wilford's article was written in 2007.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At this time, students involved in a course called “materials in human experience,” were busy making a 60-foot-long fiber bridge in the Peruvian style.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through this project, they were introduced to the Inca people's way of thinking and building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After creating their ropes and cables, they had planned to stretch the bridge across a dry basin between two campus buildings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Roads&lt;/u&gt; ===
[[File:Inca trail, Peru.jpg|thumb|This trail was originally constructed by the Inca in Peru. It is now part of the&amp;nbsp;Inca trail to Machu Picchu.]]
[[File:Camino-inca-dia4-c06.jpg|thumb|An example of the Inca trail&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Cusco]]&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;[[Machu Picchu]]&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;[[Perú]].]]
According to author Mark Cartwright, "[[Inca road system|Inca roads]] covered over 40,000 km (25,000 miles), principally in two main highways running north to south across the [[Inca Empire]], which eventually spread over ancient Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several sources challenge Cartwright's claim in stating that the Inca roads covered either more or less area then he describes. This number is difficult to solidify since some of the pathways of the Inca still may remain unaccounted for, being that they may have been washed away or covered by natural forces. "Inca engineers were also undaunted by geographical difficulties and built roads across ravines, rivers, deserts, and mountain passes up to 5,000 metres high."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the constructed roads are not uniform in design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the uncovered roads are about one to four meters wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this is true, some roads, such as the highway in [[Huánuco Pampa|Huanuco Pampa]] province, can be much larger in size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As mentioned in the "Pathway Systems" section, the Inca people mainly traveled on foot. Knowing this, the roads created were most likely built and paved for both humans and animals to walk and/or run along. Several roads were paved with stones or cobbles and some were "edged and protected with the use of small stone walls, stone markers, wooden or cane posts, or piles of stones."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Drainage was something that was of particular interest and importance to the Inca people. Drains and culverts were built to ensure that rainwater would effectively run off of the road's surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The drains and culverts helped in directing the accumulating water either along or under the road.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Uses'' ====
1. As mentioned above under the section "Pathway Systems," there were several uses for the [[Inca road system|Inca roads]]. The most obvious way in which the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] people used the road/trail systems were to transport goods. They did this on foot and sometimes with the help of animals (llamas and alpacas).

2. Not only were goods transported throughout the vast [[Inca Empire|empire]], but so were ideas and messages. The Inca needed a system of communication, so they relied on [[Chasqui]]s, otherwise known as messengers.&lt;ref name=":13x"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discover-peru.org/inca-roads-chasqui/|title=Inca Roads and Chasquis|last=|first=|date=|website=Discover Peru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chasqui]]s were chosen among the strongest and fittest young males.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; They ran several miles per day, only to deliver messages.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These messengers resided in cabins called "[[Tambo (Incan structure)|tambos]]."&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These structures were positioned along the roads and built by the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These buildings provided the [[Chasqui]]s with a place to rest.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These places of rest could also be used to house the Inca army in a situation of rebellion or war.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt;

==== ''Modern Inca Roads'' ====
Today, many travel to South America to hike the Inca trail.&lt;ref name=":14x"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perutreks.com/inca_trail_to_machu_picchu.html|title=Inca Trail to Machu Picchu|last=|first=|date=|website=Peru Treks &amp; Adventure|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walking and climbing the trail not only serves the purpose of allowing visitors to expirience the historic pathways of the Inca people, but it allows for tourists and locals to see the Inca ruins, mountains, and exotic vegetation and animals.&lt;ref name=":14x" /&gt;

The '''Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation''' (ITBC), in [[Bahasa Malaysia]]: Institut Biologi Tropika dan Pemuliharaan (IBTP) is a research institute of [[Universiti Malaysia Sabah]] in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. Founded in 1996, its objectives have been to promote and carry out research on the [[biodiversity]] of tropical flora and fauna, especially of the Malaysian state of Sabah, and to build resources that facilitate this, such as technical laboratories for DNA analysis, organic chemistry, and microscopy, and the "Borneensis" natural history collection focusing on native flora and fauna.
The institute has had three directors: the founding director, entomologist Prof. Dr. Maryati Mohamed (1996–2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sajise|editor1-first=Percy E.|editor2-last=Ticsay|editor2-first=Mariliza V.|editor3-last=Saguiguit|editor3-first=Gil C.|title=Moving forward : Southeast Asian perspectives on climate change and biodiversity|date=2010|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9812309785}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoologist Prof. Dr. Abdul Hamid Ahmad (2008–2012), and the current director, organic chemist Prof. Dr. Charles S. Vairappan.
ITBC publishes the open-access, online ''Journal of Tropical Biology and Conservation''.

The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D. N.|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6226|year=2015|doi=10.1126/science.aaa0980|pmid=25745164|pages=1100–1102|bibcode=2015Sci...347.1100S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Occam's razor]], six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Planck Collaboration | title = Planck 2015 results.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

'''Language proficiency''' or '''linguistic proficiency''' is the ability of an individual to speak or perform in a [[language]]. As theories among pedagogues as to what constitutes proficiency go,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408094300/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions |date=April 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little consistency as to how different organizations classify it. Additionally, [[fluency]] and [[language]] [[Linguistic competence|competence]] are generally recognized as being related, but separate controversial subjects. In predominant frameworks in the [[United States]], proficient speakers demonstrate both accuracy and fluency, and use a variety of discourse strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429203232/http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf |date=April 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, native speakers of a language can be [[wikt:fluent|fluent]] without being considered proficient. Native-level fluency is estimated to be between 20,000 and 40,000 words, but basic conversational fluency might require only as little as 3,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109160341/http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency |date=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===ACTFL===
The [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] (ACTFL) distinguishes between proficiency and performance. In part, ACTFL's definition of proficiency is derived from mandates issued by the U.S. government, declaring that a [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] student is one who comes from a non-English background and "who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language and whose difficulties may deny such an individual the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society".

ACTFL views "performance" as being the combined effect of all three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational.

==Proficiency frameworks==
Note that test scores may not correlate reliably, as different understandings of proficiency lead to different types of assessment:
*FSI Test ([[Foreign Service Institute]]) Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/staff/globeg/ilrhome.shtml |title=ILR Scale |publisher=Utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(deprecated)''
*[[ILR scale|Interagency Language Roundtable]]  Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ''(evolved from FSI)''
*[[Language Proficiency Index]]
*[[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines]] ACTFL recognises ten different levels of proficiency: "novice", "intermediate", "advanced", and "superior", of which the first three are each subdivided into "low", "mid", and "high".
*[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] CEFR recognises six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

==Pronunciation and etymology==
In American English, "lichen" is pronounced the same as the verb "liken" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|k|ən}}). In British English, both this pronunciation and one rhyming with "kitchen" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|tʃ|ən}}) are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/mind-your-language/8757911/lichen/ |title=Lichen |date=17 November 2012 |publisher=spectator.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/1992/4-29-1992/lichen.html |title=Lichens – Horticulture and Home Pest News |publisher=iastate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lichen |title=Lichen |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2014-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English ''lichen'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λειχήν}} ''leichēn'' ("tree moss, lichen, lichen-like eruption on skin") via [[Latin]] {{lang|la|lichen}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|lichen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|lichen|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|leixh/n|λειχήν|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek noun, which literally means "licker", derives from the verb {{lang|grc|λείχειν}} ''leichein'', "to lick".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lei/xw|λείχειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Robert S.

== Growth forms ==
{{Main|Lichen growth forms}}
Lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms ([[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]). The shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; The nonreproductive tissues, or vegetative body parts, is called the '''thallus'''. Lichens are grouped by thallus type, since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen. Thallus growth forms typically correspond to a few basic internal structure types. [[List of common names of lichen genera|Common names for lichens]] often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen [[genus]].

Common groupings of lichen thallus growth forms are:
# [[fruticose lichen|fruticose]]&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; – growing like a tuft or multiple-branched leafless mini-shrub, upright or hanging down, 3-dimensional branches with nearly round cross section ([[terete]]) or flattened
# [[foliose lichen|foliose]]&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; – growing in 2-dimensional, flat, leaf-like lobes
# [[crustose lichen|crustose]]&lt;ref name=ANBGLG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm |title=Lichen Glossary |last=Galloway |first=D.J. |date=13 May 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206070827/http://www.anbg.gov.au/glossary/webpubl/lichglos.htm |archive-date=6 December 2014 |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; – crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface ([[substrate (biology)|substrate]]) like a thick coat of paint
# [[Squamulose lichen|squamulose]]&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; – formed of small leaf-like scales crustose below but free at the tips
# [[Leprose lichen|leprose]]&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; – powdery
# [[Gelatinous lichen|gelatinous]] – jelly like
# [[filamentous lichen|filamentous]] – stringy or like matted hair
# [[Byssoid lichen|byssoid]] – wispy, like [[teased wool]]
# structureless

There are variations in growth types in a single lichen species, grey areas between the growth type descriptions, and overlapping between growth types, so some authors might describe lichens using different growth type descriptions.

When a crustose lichen gets old, the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint, old-broken asphalt paving, or like the polygonal "islands" of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed. This is called being [[rimose]] or [[areolate]], and the "island" pieces separated by the cracks are called [[areola (lichen)|areolas]].&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; The areolas appear separated, but are (or were){{citation needed|date=October 2014}} connected by an underlying "prothallus" or "hypothallus".&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; When a crustose lichen grows from a center and appears to radiate out, it is called [[crustose placodioid lichen|crustose placodioid]]. When the edges of the areolas lift up from the substrate, it is called [[squamulose]].&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}}&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;

These growth form groups are not precisely defined. Foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose. Fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy. Squamulose lichens may appear where the edges lift up. Gelatinous lichens may appear leafy when dry.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Means of telling them apart in these cases are in the sections below.

Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} The thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is most visually noticeable. Some lichens can grow ''inside'' solid rock between the grains ([[endolithic lichen]]s), with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; These may be dramatic in color or appearance.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories.&lt;ref name="LNAILV"&gt;Lichen Vocabulary, Lichens of North America Information, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The most visually noticeable reproductive parts are often circular, raised, plate-like or disc-like outgrowths, with crinkly edges, and are described in sections below.

=== Color ===
Lichens come in many colors.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} Coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component.&lt;ref name=MSULB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/course/bot/423/Plntlist8mosslichen.html|title=Lichens and Bryophytes, Michigan State University, 10-25-99|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special pigments, such as yellow [[usnic acid]], give lichens a variety of colors, including reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, especially in exposed, dry habitats.&lt;ref name=SJCL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saguaro-juniper.com/i_and_i/lichens/lichens.html|title=Lichens, Saguaro-Juniper Corporation|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of special pigments, lichens are usually bright green to olive gray when wet, gray or grayish-green to brown when dry.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; This is because moisture causes the surface skin ([[cortex (lichen)|cortex]]) to become more transparent, exposing the green photobiont layer.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; Different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces, or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors "come to life" or "glow" in brilliant displays following rain.

Different colored lichens may inhabit different adjacent sections of a rock face, depending on the angle of exposure to light.&lt;ref name=SJCL/&gt; Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places, such as the [[Lichens of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)#On rock|vertical "paint"]] covering the vast rock faces of [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref name=LSN/&gt;

Color is used in identification.&lt;ref name="JJMML"&gt;Michigan Lichens, Julie Jones Medlin, B. Jain Publishers, 1996, {{ISBN|0877370397}}, 9780877370390, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Jo0yP2-69UC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Color changes depending on when a lichen is wet or dry.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt; Color descriptions when used for identification are based on when the lichen is dry.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt; Dry lichens with a cyanobacterium as the photosynthetic partner tend to be dark grey, brown, or black.&lt;ref name=JJMML/&gt;

The underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side ([[dorsiventral]]), often brown or black, sometimes white. A fruticose lichen may have flattened "branches", appearing similar to a foiliose lichen, but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the ''same'' color as the top side. The leaf-like lobes of a foliose lichen may branch, giving the appearance of a fruticose lichen, but the underside will be a ''different'' color from the top side.&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt;

The sheen on some jelly-like gelatinous lichens is from [[mucilaginous]] secretions.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt;

=== Internal structure and growth forms ===
[[File:Hyella caespitosa.jpg|thumb|right|The cyanobacterium ''Hyella caespitosa'' with fungal hyphae in the lichen ''Pyrenocollema halodytes'']]
A lichen consists of a simple photosynthesizing organism, usually a [[green alga]] or [[cyanobacterium]], surrounded by filaments of a fungus. Generally, most of a lichen's bulk is made of interwoven fungal filaments,&lt;ref name="LMM"&gt;Lichens: More on Morphology, University of California Museum of Paleontology, [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenmm.html]&lt;/ref&gt; although in filamentous and gelatinous lichens&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; this is not the case. The fungus is called a '''mycobiont'''. The photosynthesizing organism is called a '''photobiont'''. Algal photobionts are called '''phycobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP&gt;[http://www.unomaha.edu/lichens/Bio%204350%20PDF/Photobionts.pdf Lichen Photobionts, University of Nebraska Omaha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006145803/http://www.unomaha.edu/lichens/Bio%204350%20PDF/Photobionts.pdf |date=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria photobionts are called '''cyanobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

The part of a lichen that is not involved in reproduction, the "body" or "vegetative tissue" of a lichen, is called the '''thallus'''. The thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately. The thallus is made up of filaments of the fungus called '''[[hyphae]]'''. The filaments grow by branching then rejoining to create a mesh, which is called being "[[Glossary of botanical terms|anastomose]]". The mesh of fungal filaments may be dense or loose.

Generally, the fungal mesh surrounds the algal or [[cyanobacterial]] cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues that are unique to lichen associations. The thallus may or may not have a protective "skin" of densely packed fungal filaments, often containing a second fungal species,&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309" /&gt; which is called a '''cortex.''' Fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the "branches". Foliose lichens have an upper cortex on the top side of the "leaf", and a separate lower cortex on the bottom side. Crustose and squamulose lichens have only an upper cortex, with the "inside" of the lichen in direct contact with the surface they grow on (the '''substrate'''). Even if the edges peel up from the substrate and appear flat and leaf-like, they lack a lower cortex, unlike foliose lichens. Filamentous, byssoid, leprose,&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; gelatinous, and other lichens do not have a cortex, which is called being [[ecorticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGGO/&gt;

[[File:Lichen Cross Section Diagram.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Schematic cross section of [[foliose lichen]]:&lt;br&gt;1. The [[cortex (lichen)|cortex]] is the outer layer of tightly woven fungus filaments ([[hyphae]]) 2. This photobiont layer has photosynthesizing [[green algae]]&lt;br&gt;3. Loosely packed hyphae in the medulla&lt;br&gt;4. A tightly woven lower cortex, with anchoring hyphae called [[rhizines]] where the fungus attaches to the substrate.]]
Fruticose, foliose, crustose, and squamulose lichens generally have up to three different types of tissue, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] by having different densities of fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The top layer, where the lichen contacts the environment, is called a '''cortex'''.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The cortex is made of densely tightly woven, packed, and glued together ([[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinated]]) fungal filaments.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The dense packing makes the cortex act like a protective "skin", keeping other organisms out, and reducing the intensity of sunlight on the layers below.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The cortex layer can be up to several hundred micrometers (μm) in thickness (less than a millimeter).&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; The cortex may be further topped by an epicortex of secretions, not cells, 0.6–1&amp;nbsp;μm thick in [[Parmeliaceae|some lichens]].&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt; This secretion layer may or may not have pores.&lt;ref name=Budel1996/&gt;

Below the cortex layer is a layer called the '''photobiontic layer''' or '''symbiont layer'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments, with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, similar to the anatomy of a leaf.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by a [[haustorium]].&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt; In crustose and foliose lichens, algae in the photobiontic layer are diffuse among the fungal filaments, decreasing in gradation into the layer below. In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below.&lt;ref name=MSULB/&gt;

The layer beneath the symbiont layer called is called the '''[[medulla (lichenology)|medulla]]'''. The medulla is less densely packed with fungal filaments than the layers above. In foliose lichens, there is usually, as in ''[[Peltigera]]'',&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} another densely packed layer of fungal filaments called the lower cortex.&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt;&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Root-like fungal structures called '''rhizines''' ([[Hypogymnia|usually]])&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} grow from the lower cortex to attach or anchor the lichen to the substrate.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASLTT/&gt; Fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the "stems" and "branches".&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt; The medulla is the lowest layer, and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus, or it may be hollow.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Crustose and squamulose lichens lack a lower cortex, and the medulla is in direct contact with the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] that the lichen grows on.

In crustose areolate lichens, the edges of the areolas peel up from the substrate and appear leafy. In squamulose lichens the part of the lichen thallus that is not attached to the substrate may also appear leafy. But these leafy parts lack a lower cortex, which distinguishes crustose and squamulose lichens from foliose lichens.&lt;ref name=LMM/&gt; Conversely, foliose lichens may appear flattened against the substrate like a crustose lichen, but most of the leaf-like lobes can be lifted up from the substrate because it is separated from it by a tightly packed lower cortex.&lt;ref name=ASLTT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/lichenthallustypes.html#foliose|title=Foliose lichens, Lichen Thallus Types, Allan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelatinous,&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} byssoid, and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are [[ecorticate]]), and generally have only undifferentiated tissue, similar to only having a symbiont layer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In lichens that include both green algal ''and'' cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called '''[[cephalodium|cephalodia]]'''.

'''[[Pruinia]]''' is a whitish coating on top of an upper surface.&lt;ref name=HPTCLGD/&gt; An '''[[epinecral layer]]''' is "a layer of horny dead fungal hyphae with indistinct [[lumen (anatomy)|lumina]] in or near the cortex above the algal layer".&lt;ref name=HPTCLGD&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3244302 |jstor=3244302 |title=Pruina as a Taxonomic Character in the Lichen Genus ''Dermatocarpon'' |journal=The Bryologist |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=315–320 |year=1996 |last1=Heiđmarsson |first1=Starri |last2=Heidmarsson |first2=Starri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, it was reported that macrolichens have more than one species of fungus in their tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309"/&gt;

==Physiology==

=== Symbiotic relation ===
{{Main|Symbiosis in lichens}}
::''"Lichens are fungi that have discovered agriculture"'' —[[Trevor Goward]]&lt;ref name=LNAILBE&gt;Sharnoff, Sylvia and Sharnoff, Stephen. [http://www.sharnoffphotos.com/lichen_info/biology.html "Lichen Biology and the Environment"]. sharnoffphotos.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A lichen is a composite organism that emerges from [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]] living among the filaments ([[hyphae]]) of the [[Fungus|fungi]] in a mutually beneficial [[symbiotic]] relationship. The fungi benefit from the carbohydrates produced by the algae or cyanobacteria via [[photosynthesis]]. The algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungi, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it. Although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen, the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners, whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic. However, while symbiotic, the relationship is probably not [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], since the algae give up a disproportionate amount of their sugars (see below). Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. If a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can [[nitrogen fixation|fix atmospheric nitrogen]], complementing the activities of the green alga.

In three different lineages the fungal partner has independently lost the mitochondrial gene atp9, which has key functions in mitochondrial energy production. The loss makes the fungi completely dependent on their symbionts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14519 Reductions in complexity of mitochondrial genomes in lichen‐forming fungi shed light on genome architecture of obligate symbioses - Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The algal or cyanobacterial cells are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] and, as in plants, they [[redox|reduce]] atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Phycobionts (algae) produce [[sugar alcohols]] ([[ribitol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[erythritol]]), which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus).&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; Cyanobionts produce [[glucose]].&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; Lichenized fungal cells can make the photobiont "leak" out the products of photosynthesis, where they can then be absorbed by the fungus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|5}}

It appears many, probably the majority, of lichen also live in a symbiotic relationship with an order of basidiomycete yeasts called Cyphobasidiales. The absence of this third partner could explain the difficulties of growing lichen in the laboratory. The yeast cells are responsible for the formation of the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus, and could also be important for its shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6298/488 Basidiomycete yeasts in the cortex of ascomycete macrolichens – Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lichen combination of alga or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology), physiology, and biochemistry than the component fungus, alga, or cyanobacterium growing by itself, naturally or in culture. The body ([[thallus]]) of most lichens is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as a structureless, undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments ([[hyphae]]). If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=LNA/&gt; In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

Evidence that lichens are examples of successful [[symbiosis]] is the fact that lichens can be found in almost every habitat and geographic area on the planet.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt; Two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens, but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19853051 |year=2010 |author1=Skaloud |first1=P |title=Evolutionary inferences based on ITS rDNA and actin sequences reveal extensive diversity of the common lichen alga ''Asterochloris'' (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=36–46 |last2=Peksa |first2=O |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.09.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case where one fungal partner simultaneously had two green algae partners that outperform each other in different climates, this might indicate having more than one photosynthetic partner at the same time might enable the lichen to exist in a wider range of habitats and geographic locations.&lt;ref name=TT/&gt;

Phycobionts can have a net output of sugars with only water vapor.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; The thallus must be saturated with liquid water for cyanobionts to photosynthesize.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

Algae produce sugars that are absorbed by the fungus by diffusion into special fungal hyphae called [[appressoria]] or [[haustoria]] in contact with the wall of the algal cells.&lt;ref name=ELWWL&gt;{{cite web |author=Ramel, Gordon |title=What is a Lichen? |publisher=Earthlife Web, |url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/lichen.html|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appressoria or haustoria may produce a substance that increases permeability of the algal cell walls, and may penetrate the walls.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt; The algae may lose up to 80% of their sugar production to the fungus.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt;

===Ecology===
Lichen associations may be examples of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]] or even [[parasitism]], depending on the species. There is evidence to suggest that the lichen symbiosis is [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensalistic]], rather than [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]].&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmadjian V.|date= 1993 |title=''The Lichen Symbiosis'' |publisher=New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-57885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange. The association is able to continue because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ahmadjian/&gt; The [[fungus]] surrounds the algal cells,&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall,&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; forming penetration pegs ([[haustoria]]) similar to those produced by [[pathogenic fungus|pathogenic fungi]] that feed on a host.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Honegger1988/&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen.

====Miniature ecosystem and holobiont theory====
Symbiosis in lichens is so well-balanced that lichens have been considered to be relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21134099|year=2011|author1=Casano|first1=L.

Many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used to cheaply&lt;ref name=LLHE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Speer |first1=Brian R |author2=Ben Waggoner |title=Lichens: Life History &amp; Ecology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenlh.html |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |date=May 1997 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; assess [[air pollution]],&lt;ref name=ferry/&gt;&lt;ref name=rosehawksworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawksworthrose1976/&gt; [[ozone]] depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have been used in making [[dye]]s, [[Evernia prunastri|perfume]]s,&lt;ref name=OMAO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorie-inc.us/oakmoss.html|title=Oak Moss Absolute Oil, Evernia prunastri, Perfume Fixative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[traditional medicine]]s. A few lichen species are eaten by insects&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; or larger animals, such as reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.1984.tb01138.x |title=Wild reindeer foraging-niche organization |journal=Ecography |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=345 |year=1984 |last1=Skogland |first1=Terje }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens are widely used as environmental indicators or bio-indicators. If air is very badly polluted with sulphur dioxide there may be no lichens present, just green algae may be found. If the air is clean, shrubby, hairy and leafy lichens become abundant. A few lichen species can tolerate quite high levels of pollution and are commonly found on pavements, walls and tree bark in urban areas. The most sensitive lichens are shrubby and leafy while the most tolerant lichens are all crusty in appearance. Since industrialisation many of the shrubby and leafy lichens such as ''Ramalina, Usnea'' and ''Lobaria'' species have very limited ranges, often being confined to the parts with the purest air.

====Lichenicolous fungi====
Some fungi can only be found living ''on'' lichens as [[obligate]] [[parasite]]s. These are referred to as [[lichenicolous fungi]], and are a different species from the fungus living inside the lichen; thus they are not considered to be part of the lichen.&lt;ref name=LFIEB&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0007-2745(2003)106[0080:LFIEAB]2.0.CO;2|year=2003|volume=106|page=80|title=Lichenicolous Fungi: Interactions, Evolution, and Biodiversity|journal=The Bryologist|last1=Lawrey|first1=James D.|last2=Diederich|first2=Paul|url=http://www.lichenology.info/pdf/LawreyDiederich.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to water===
Moisture makes the cortex become more transparent.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} This way, the algae can conduct photosynthesis when moisture is available, and is protected at other times. When the cortex is more transparent, the algae show more clearly and the lichen looks greener.

===Metabolites, metabolite structures and bioactivity===
Lichens can show intense antioxidant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25808912 | doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12850 | title=Comparative analysis of the antioxidant properties of Icelandic and Hawaiian lichens |date=March 2015 | journal=Environmental Microbiology  |vauthors=Hagiwara K, Wright PR, etal | volume=18 | issue=8 | pages=2319–2325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15752633 | doi=10.1016/j.fitote.2004.05.012 | volume=76 | issue=2 | title=Antioxidant activity, reducing power and total phenolic content of some lichen species |date=March 2005 | journal=Fitoterapia | pages=216–219  |vauthors=Odabasoglu F, Aslan A, Cakir A, etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secondary metabolites]] are often deposited as crystals in the [[apoplast]].&lt;ref name=HSLNA&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.01.003|title=Norstictic acid: Correlations between its physico-chemical characteristics and ecological preferences of lichens producing this depsidone|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=68|issue=3|page=309|year=2010|last1=Hauck|first1=Markus|last2=Jürgens|first2=Sascha-René|last3=Leuschner|first3=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary metabolites are thought to play a role in preference for some substrates over others.&lt;ref name=HSLNA/&gt;

Sometimes lichens contain structures made from fungal [[metabolite]]s, for example crustose lichens sometimes have a [[polysaccharide]]{{clarify|reason=which polysaccharide? What is the evidence it derives from the fungus?|date=July 2015}} layer in the cortex.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Growth rate ===
Lichens often have a regular but very slow growth rate of less than a millimeter per year.&lt;ref name=LNAILBE/&gt; Different lichen species have been measured to grow as slowly as 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm, and as fast as 0.5 meter per year.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/growth.html|title=The Earth Life Web, Growth and Development in Lichens|publisher=earthlife.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In crustose lichens, the area along the margin is where the most active growth is taking place.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} Most crustose lichens grow only 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter per year.

=== Life span ===
Lichens may be [[longevity|long-lived]], with some considered to be among the oldest living organisms.&lt;ref name=LNA/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2007"/&gt; Lifespan is difficult to measure because of what defines as the "same" individual lichen is not precise.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL/&gt; Lichens grow by vegetatively breaking off a piece, which may or may not be defined as the "same" lichen, and two lichens can merge, then becoming the "same" lichen.&lt;ref name=ELNGDL/&gt; An [[Arctic]] species called "map lichen" (''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'') has been dated at 8,600 years, apparently the world's oldest living organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/nature/lichens.htm |title=Lichens|publisher=National Park Service, US Department of the Interior, Government of the United States|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to environmental stress===
Unlike simple dehydration in plants and animals, lichens may experience a ''complete'' loss of body water in dry periods.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of [[water]] content ([[poikilohydric]]).&lt;ref name="Nash2008-intro"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} They quickly absorb water when it becomes available again, becoming soft and fleshy.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Reconfiguration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes or more.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In tests, lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the [[adaptive capacity|adaptation capacity]] of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic activity]] within the [[simulation|simulation time]] of 34 days under [[Life on Mars (planet)#Life on Earth under Martian conditions|Martian conditions]] in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR).&lt;ref name="Skymania-20120426"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Emily |title=Lichen survives harsh Mars environment |url=http://www.skymania.com/wp/2012/04/lichen-survives-harsh-martian-setting.html |date=26 April 2012 |publisher=Skymania News |accessdate=27 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]] has discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space. In an experiment led by Leopoldo Sancho from the Complutense University of Madrid, two species of lichen—''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'' and ''[[Xanthoria elegans]]''—were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket 31 May 2005. Once in orbit, the capsules were opened and the lichens were directly exposed to the vacuum of space with its widely fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation. After 15 days, the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be unchanged in their ability to photosynthesize.&lt;ref name="urlESA - Human Spaceflight and Exploration - Lichen survives in space"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sancho2007/&gt;

== Reproduction and dispersal ==

===Vegetative reproduction===
[[File:Lichen reproduction1.jpg|thumb|right|''Xanthoparmelia'' sp. with dark-colored reproductive structures (disc-like [[apothecia]]) at center, surrounded by a pale coloured vegetative [[thallus]].]]
Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own ([[vegetative reproduction]]) or through the dispersal of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]]s containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Because of the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus, the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred. Fruticose lichens can easily{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} fragment, and new lichens can grow from the fragment ([[vegetative reproduction]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns.&lt;ref name=Eichorn2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook1995/&gt; '''Soredia''' (singular: "soredium") are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia, from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; '''Isidia''' (singular: "isidium") are branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the "core species".&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. N. Rai|author2=B. Bergman|author3=Ulla Rasmussen|title=Cyanobacteria in Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM8nzztrTbEC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=2 June 2013|date=31 July 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0777-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual reproduction===
[[File:Lichen reproduction.jpg|thumb|left|Disc-like [[apothecia]] (left) and [[thallus]] (right) on a [[foliose lichen]]]]
Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|4}} Only the fungal partner in a lichen reproduces sexually.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Many lichen fungi reproduce sexually like other fungi, producing spores formed by [[meiosis]] and fusion of gametes. Following dispersal, such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form.

Some lichen fungi belong to [[Basidiomycetes]] ('''basidiolichens''') and produce [[mushroom]]-like reproductive structures resembling those of their nonlichenized relatives.

Most lichen fungi belong to [[Ascomycetes]] ('''ascolichens'''). Among the ascolichens, [[spore]]s are produced in spore-producing structures called '''[[ascomata]]'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt; The most common types of ascomata are the '''[[apothecium]]''' (plural: apothecia) and '''[[perithecium]]''' (plural: perithecia).&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} Apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs located on the top surface of the lichen thallus. When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called '''lirellae'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} Perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue, which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask, and appear like black dots on the lichen surface.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}}

The three most common spore body types are raised discs called '''[[Ascocarp|apothecia]]''' (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups with a small hole at the top called '''perithecia''' (singular: perithecium), and '''pycnidia''' (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an [[ascus]] is the structure that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the [[Ascomycota]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earthlife.net/lichens/reproduction.html | title=Lichen Reproductive Structures | author=Ramel, Gordon | accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called '''[[ascus|asci]]''' (singular: ascus), and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the apothecium has an outer margin, the margin is called the '''exciple'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called '''lecanorine''', meaning similar to members of the genus ''[[Lecanora]]''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the exciple is blackened like carbon it is called '''lecideine''' meaning similar to members of the genus ''[[Lecidea]]''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}} When the margin is pale or colorless it is called '''biatorine'''.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|14}}

[[File:Pilophorus acicularis 109164.jpg|thumb|right|Crust-like thallus with [[pseudopodetia]]]]
A "[[podetium]]" (plural: [[podetia]]) is a lichenized stalk-like structure of the fruiting body rising from the thallus, associated with some fungi that produce a fungal [[apothecium]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. They usually bear the fungal [[pycnidia]] or [[apothecia]] or both.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Many lichens have [[apothecia]] that are visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

Most lichens produce abundant sexual structures.&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt; Many species appear to disperse only by sexual spores.&lt;ref name=Murtagh&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murtagh GJ, Dyer PS, Crittenden PD |title=Sex and the single lichen |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6778 |page=564 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10766229 |doi=10.1038/35007142 |bibcode=2000Natur.404..564M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the crustose lichens ''Graphis scripta'' and ''Ochrolechia parella'' produce no symbiotic vegetative propagules. Instead, the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are [[homothallic]]). This breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments.&lt;ref name=Murtagh/&gt;

'''Mazaedia''' (singular: mazaedium) are apothecia shaped like a [[Pin#Straight pins|dressmaker's pin]] in ([[pin lichen]])s, where the fruiting body is a brown or black mass of loose ascospores enclosed by a cup-shaped exciple, which sits on top of a tiny stalk.&lt;ref name=SSFGCL/&gt;{{rp|15}}

== Taxonomy and classification ==
Lichens are classified by the fungal component. Lichen species are given the same scientific name ([[binomial name]]) as the fungus species in the lichen. Lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungus.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt; There are about 13,500–17,000 identified lichen species.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt; Nearly 20% of known fungal species are associated with lichens.&lt;ref name=ELWWL/&gt;

"'''Lichenized fungus'''" may refer to the entire lichen, or to just the fungus. This may cause confusion without context. A particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species, giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species, but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species.&lt;ref name=FSSD&gt;{{cite web |title=Form and structure – ''Sticta'' and ''Dendriscocaulon'' |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens |url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/form-structure-sticta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division, the '''Mycophycophyta''', but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate [[biological classification|lineages]]. Neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form [[monophyletic]] lineages in their respective fungal phyla, but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum.&lt;ref name=Lutzoni_2004/&gt; Even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus ''[[Geosiphon|Geosiphon pyriforme]]'', a member of the [[Glomeromycota]] that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells. ''[[Geosiphon]]'' is not usually considered to be a lichen, and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years. The genus is more closely allied to [[Mycorrhiza|endomycorrhizal]] genera. Fungi from [[Verrucariales]] also form marine lichens with the [[brown algae]] ''Petroderma maculiforme'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21653406 The intertidal marine lichen formed by the pyrenomycete fungus Verrucaria tavaresiae (Ascomycotina) and the brown alga Petroderma maculiforme (Phaeophyceae): thallus organization and symbiont interaction – NCBI]&lt;/ref&gt; and have a symbiotic relationship with [[seaweed]] like ([[Ascophyllum|rockweed]]) and [[Blidingia minima]], where the algae are the dominant components. The fungi is thought to help the rockweeds to resist desiccation when exposed to air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/mycologywebpages/NaturalHistoryOfFungi/AlgalMutualisms.html Mutualisms between fungi and algae – New Brunswick Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/lichenologist/article/challenging-the-lichen-concept-turgidosculum-ulvae-verrucariaceae-represents-an-independent-photobiont-shift-to-a-multicellular-bladelike-alga/3F6C39EE053596364B0F5B23EE1F581C Challenging the lichen concept: Turgidosculum ulvae – Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, lichens can also use [[yellow-green algae]] ([[Heterococcus]]) as their symbiotic partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-39 Congruence of chloroplast – BMC Evolutionary Biology – BioMed Central]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria multiple times throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lutzoni |first1=Francois |last2=Pagel |first2=Mark |last3=Reeb |first3=Valerie |title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors |journal=Nature |date=June 21, 2001 |volume=411 |issue=6840 |pages=937–940 |doi=10.1038/35082053|pmid=11418855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fungi ===
The fungal component of a lichen is called the '''mycobiont'''. The mycobiont may be an [[Ascomycete]] or [[Basidiomycete]].&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; The associated lichens are called either [[Ascomycota|ascolichens]] or [[basidiolichen]]s, respectively. Living as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients since about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life.&lt;ref name=Hawksworth1988/&gt;

Thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the secondary metabolites identical,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} indicating{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. But the same mycobiont with different photobionts may also produce very different growth forms.&lt;ref name=FSSD/&gt; Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species.

Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

The following table lists the [[Order (biology)|orders]] and [[Family (biology)|families]] of fungi that include lichen-forming species.
{{Lichen family taxonomy}}

===Photobionts===
The [[photosynthetic]] partner in a lichen is called a '''photobiont'''. The photobionts in lichens come from a variety of simple [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] organisms. In the majority of lichens the photobiont is a green alga ([[Chlorophyta]]) or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. In some lichens both types are present. Algal photobionts are called '''phycobionts''', while cyanobacterial photobionts are called '''cyanobionts'''.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; According to one source, about 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts, and about 10% have cyanobionts,&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; while another source states that two thirds of lichens have green algae as phycobiont, and about one third have a cyanobiont.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;  Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: [[Cyanophyceae]]; eukaryotic: [[Trebouxiophyceae]], [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Chlorophyceae]]) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.&lt;ref name=Friedl1996/&gt;

Common [[algal]] photobionts are from the genera ''[[Trebouxia]]'', ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'', ''[[Pseudotrebouxia]]'', or ''[[Myrmecia (alga)|Myrmecia]]''. ''[[Trebouxia]]'' is the most common genus of green algae in lichens, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. "Trebouxioid" means either a photobiont that is in the genus ''[[Trebouxia]]'', or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class [[Trebouxiophyceae]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html|title=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second most commonly represented green alga genus is ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]''.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt; Overall, about 100 species of eukaryotes are known to occur as photobionts in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

A "[[cyanolichen]]" is a lichen with a [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] as its main photosynthetic component (photobiont).&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html|title=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cyanolichen are also ascolichens, but a few basidiolichen like [[Dictyonema]] and [[Acantholichen]] have cyanobacteria as their partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=AtOyDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=The+cyanobionts+of+the+Dictyonema+and+related+basidiomycetes+Cora+Acantholichen&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE1LyW1-vdAhUI2qQKHQaeALAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20cyanobionts%20of%20the%20Dictyonema%20and%20related%20basidiomycetes%20Cora%20Acantholichen&amp;f=false Modern Topics in the Phototrophic Prokaryotes: Environmental and Applied Aspects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'', which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the "core species".&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"/&gt;

The same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = H. | last2 = Miadlikowska | first2 = J. | last3 = Lutzoni | first3 = F. | year = 2005 | title = Assessing host specialization in symbiotic cyanobacteria associated with four closely related species of the lichen fungus ''Peltigera'' | url = | journal = European Journal of Phycology | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 363–378 | doi=10.1080/09670260500342647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same phycobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt; More than one phycobiont may be present in a single thallus.&lt;ref name=UNOLP/&gt;

===Controversy over classification method and species names===
There are about 20,000 known lichen [[species (biology)|species]].&lt;ref name=UCLS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichensy.html|title=Lichens: Systematics, University of California Museum of Paleontology|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But what is meant by "species" is different from what is meant by biological species in plants, animals, or fungi, where being the same species implies that there is a common [[ancestral lineage]].&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; Because lichens are combinations of members of two or even three different biological [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s, these components ''must'' have a ''different'' ancestral lineage from each other. By convention, lichens are still called "species" anyway, and are classified according to the species of their fungus, not the species of the algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens are given the same scientific name ([[binomial name]]) as the fungus in them, which may cause some confusion. The alga bears its own scientific name, which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungus.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt;

Depending on context, "lichenized fungus" may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus when it is in the lichen, which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria. Some algae and cyanobacteria are found naturally living outside of the lichen. The fungal, algal, or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture. When growing by themselves, the fungus, algae, or cyanobacteria have very different properties than those of the lichen. Lichen properties such as growth form, physiology, and biochemistry, are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae or cyanobacteria.

The same fungus growing in combination with different algae or cyanobacteria, can produce lichens that are very different in most properties, meeting non-DNA criteria for being different "species". Historically, these different combinations were classified as different species. When the fungus is identified as being the same using modern DNA methods, these apparently different species get reclassified as the ''same'' species under the current (2014) convention for classification by fungal component. This has led to debate about this classification convention. These apparently different "species" have their own independent evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;&lt;ref name="FSSD"/&gt;

There is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus, and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium ([[synecdoche]]). This is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms, which would be considered different species by any measure other than the DNA of the fungal component. If the whole lichen produced by the same fungus growing in association with different algae or cyanobacteria, were to be classified as different "species", the number of "lichen species" would be greater.

===Diversity===
The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the [[Ascomycota]], with about 40% of species forming such an association.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt; Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as [[saprotroph]]s or [[parasite|plant parasites]] (for example, the [[Leotiales]], [[Dothideales]], and [[Pezizales]]). Other lichen fungi occur in only five [[order (biology)|orders]] in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders [[Graphidales]], [[Gyalectales]], [[Peltigerales]], [[Pertusariales]], and [[Teloschistales]]).  Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont.&lt;ref name="Lutzoni Pagel Reeb pp. 937–940"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lutzoni | first=François | last2=Pagel | first2=Mark | last3=Reeb | first3=Valérie | title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors | journal=Nature | volume=411 | issue=6840 | date=2001 | doi=10.1038/35082053 | pmid=11418855 | pages=937–940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned [[fungi imperfecti]], a catch-all category for fungi whose sexual form of reproduction has never been observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Comparatively few [[Basidiomycetes]] are lichenized, but these include [[agarics]], such as species of ''[[Lichenomphalia]]'', [[clavarioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Multiclavula]]'', and [[corticioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Dictyonema]]''.

===Identification methods===
Lichen identification uses growth form and reactions to chemical tests.

"[[Pd test|Pd]]" refers to the outcome of the [[Pd test]] or is used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test, [[para-phenylenediamine]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; If putting a drop on a lichen turns an area bright yellow to orange, this helps identify it as belonging to either the genus ''[[Cladonia]]'' or ''[[Lecanora]]''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;

=== Evolution and paleontology ===
The fossil record for lichens is poor.&lt;ref name=UCMPLFR&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichenfr.html "Lichens: Fossil Record"], University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme habitats that lichens dominate, such as tundra, mountains, and deserts, are not ordinarily conducive to producing fossils.&lt;ref name=UCMPLFR/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlFossil Record of Lichens"/&gt; There are fossilized lichens embedded in amber. The fossilized ''Anzia'' is found in pieces of amber in northern Europe and dates back approximately 40 million years.&lt;ref name=Poinar1992/&gt; Lichen fragments are also found in fossil leaf beds, such as ''[[Lobaria]]''  from Trinity County in northern California, USA, dating back to the early to middle [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=Peterson2000/&gt;

The oldest fossil lichens in which both symbiotic partners have been recovered date to the [[Devonian|Early Devonian]] [[Rhynie chert]], about 400 million years old.&lt;ref name=Taylor1995/&gt; The slightly older fossil ''[[Spongiophyton]]'' has also been interpreted as a lichen on morphological&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; and isotopic&lt;ref name=Jahren2003/&gt; grounds, although the isotopic basis is decidedly shaky.&lt;ref name=Fletcher2004/&gt; It has been demonstrated that [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] fossils ''[[Nematothallus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Edwards D, Axe L |year= 2012|title=Evidence for a fungal affinity for Nematasketum, a close ally of Prototaxites|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=168|pages=1–18|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Prototaxites]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Retallack G.J. |author2=Landing, E.|year= 2014|title=Affinities and architecture of Devonian trunks of ''Prototaxites loganii''|journal=Mycologia|volume=106|issue=6|pages=1143–1156|doi=10.3852/13-390|pmid=24990121}}&lt;/ref&gt; were lichenized. Thus lichenized [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] were a component of early [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] terrestrial ecosystems&lt;ref name=Karatygin2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karatygin2007/&gt;

The ancestral ecological state of both [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] was probably [[saprobe|saprobism]], and independent lichenization events may have occurred multiple times.&lt;ref name=Schoch2009/&gt; In 1995, Gargas and colleagues proposed that there were at least five independent origins of lichenization; three in the basidiomycetes and at least two in the Ascomycetes.&lt;ref name=Gargas1995/&gt; However, Lutzoni et al. (2001) indicate that lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses. Some non-lichen-forming fungi may have secondarily lost the ability to form a lichen association. As a result, lichenization has been viewed as a highly successful nutritional strategy.&lt;ref name=Honegger1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wedin2004/&gt;

Lichenized [[Glomeromycota]] may extend well back into the Precambrian. ''Winfrenatia'', an early zygomycetous ([[Glomeromycota]]) lichen symbiosis that may have involved controlled parasitism,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} is permineralized in the [[Rhynie Chert]] of Scotland, of early [[Devonian]] age.&lt;ref name=Taylor1997/&gt; Lichen-like fossils consisting of coccoid cells ([[cyanobacteria]]?) and thin filaments (mucoromycotinan [[Glomeromycota]]?) are permineralized in marine [[phosphorite]] of the [[Doushantuo Formation]] in southern China.

== Ecology and interactions with environment ==

===Substrates and habitats===
[[File:Der Heilige Dominikus am Nordturm des Regensburger Doms.jpg|thumb|right|Lichens on a statue made of limestone on a tower of [[Regensburg Cathedral]]]]
Lichens grow on and in a wide range of substrates and habitats, including some of the most extreme conditions on earth. They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, and hanging from branches "living on thin air" ([[epiphyte]]s) in [[rain forest]]s and in [[temperate woodland]]. They grow on bare rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces. They can survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: [[arctic tundra]], hot dry [[desert]]s, rocky coasts, and toxic [[slag heap]]s. They can even live ''inside'' solid rock, growing between the grains, and in the soil as part of a [[biological soil crust]] in arid habitats such as deserts. Some lichens do not grow on ''anything'', living out their lives blowing about the environment.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals, contributing to the process of [[weathering]] by which rocks are gradually turned into soil. While this contribution to weathering is usually benign, it can cause problems for artificial stone structures. For example, there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]] that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument.

Lichens are not [[parasites]] on the plants they grow on, but only use them as a substrate to grow on. The fungi of some lichen species may "take over" the algae of other lichen species.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABGPPU&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/cryptogams/underworld/panel-6/index.html |title=Pollution, The Plant Underworld |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt; Lichens growing on leaves may have the appearance of being parasites on the leaves, but they are not. However, some lichens, notably those of the genus ''Diploschistes'' are known to parasitise other lichens. ''Diploschistes muscorum'' starts its development in the tissue of a host ''Cladonia'' species.&lt;ref name=Honegger1988/&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;{{rp|171}}

In the arctic tundra, lichens, together with [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]], make up the majority of the [[ground cover]], which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals. An example is "[[Reindeer moss]]", which is a lichen, not a moss.&lt;ref name=LLHE/&gt;

A crustose lichen that grows on rock is called a '''[[saxicolous lichen]]'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=VMBMLF&gt;''Mosses Lichens &amp; Ferns of Northwest North America'', Dale H.

Many squamulous lichens are terricolous.&lt;ref name=VMBMLF/&gt;{{rp|159}} '''[[Umbillicate lichen]]s''' are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point.&lt;ref name="LNAILV" /&gt; A '''[[vagrant lichen]]''' is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.

===Lichens and soils===
In addition to distinct physical mechanisms by which lichens break down raw stone, recent studies indicate lichens attack stone chemically, entering newly chelated minerals into the ecology.&lt;blockquote&gt;The lichen exudates, which have powerful chelating capacity, the widespread occurrence of mineral neoformation, particularly metal oxalates, together with the characteristics of weathered substrates, all confirm the significance of lichens as chemical weathering agents.&lt;ref name=catena&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00085-5|title=Weathering of rocks induced by lichen colonization — a review |journal=CATENA |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=121 |year=2000 |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Blume |first2=Hans-Peter |last3=Beyer |first3=Lothar |url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~raman/papers2/ChenetalCatena.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Over time, this activity creates new fertile soil from lifeless stone.

Lichens may be [[Lichens and nitrogen cycling|important in contributing nitrogen]] to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting the nitrogen into the soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=Nature |volume=346 |issue=6287 |page=839 |year=1990 |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt; In deserts and semi-arid areas, [[lichens]] are part of extensive, living [[biological soil crust]]s, essential for maintaining the soil structure.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt; Lichens have a long fossil record in soils dating back 2.2 billion years.&lt;ref name="Retallack-2013"/&gt;

===Ecological interactions===
Lichens are [[pioneer species]], among the first living things to grow on bare rock or areas denuded of life by a disaster.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; Lichens may have to compete with plants for access to sunlight, but because of their small size and slow growth, they thrive in places where higher plants have difficulty growing. Lichens are often the [[ecological succession|first to settle]] in places lacking soil, constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Walker |first = T. R. | date = 2007 | title = Lichens of the boreal forests of Labrador, Canada: A checklist | journal = Evansia | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 85–90 | doi=10.1639/0747-9859-24.3.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some survive in the tough conditions of deserts, and others on frozen soil of the Arctic regions.&lt;ref name=Oksanen2006/&gt;

A major ecophysiological advantage of lichens is that they are [[poikilohydry|poikilohydric]] (''poikilo''- variable, ''hydric''- relating to water), meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration, they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe [[desiccation]]. Like some [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[fern]]s, and a few "[[resurrection plant]]s", upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as [[cryptobiosis]]) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity. In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit.
[[File:Moss_lichen.jpg|thumb|Lichens suppress the growth of mosses and higher plants around them]]
Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs and monuments. Many lichens also grow as [[epiphyte]]s (''epi''- on the surface, ''phyte''- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees. When growing on plants, lichens are not [[parasite]]s; they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it. Lichens produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic]] chemicals that inhibit the growth of mosses. Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus ''[[Cladoniaceae|Cladina]]'' (reindeer lichens), produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Lichen Allelopathy: A Review|author=Lawrey, James D. |pages=26–38| doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0582.ch002|title=Allelopathy. Organisms, Processes, and Applications|volume=582 |editors=Inderjit; K. M. M. Dakshini; Frank A. Einhellig|year=1994| publisher=American Chemical Society|series=ACS Symposium Series |isbn=978-0-8412-3061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stability (that is, longevity) of their [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] is a major factor of lichen habitats. Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, [[vascular plant|vascular (higher) plant]] seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water.

Lichens may be eaten by some animals, such as [[reindeer]], living in [[arctic]] regions. The [[larva]]e of a number of [[Lepidoptera]] species feed exclusively on lichens. These include [[Common Footman]] and [[Marbled Beauty]]. However, lichens are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates, making them unsuitable for some animals. Lichens are also used by the [[Northern Flying Squirrel]] for nesting, food, and a water source during winter.

=== Effects of air pollution ===
[[File:Lobaria pulmonaria 010108c.jpg|thumb|Some lichens, like the foliose ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'', are sensitive to air pollution.]]
If lichens are exposed to air pollutants at all times, without any [[deciduous]] parts, they are unable to avoid the accumulation of pollutants. Also lacking [[stomata]] and a [[plant cuticle|cuticle]], lichens may absorb [[aerosol]]s and gases over the entire thallus surface from which they may readily [[diffusion|diffuse]] to the photobiont layer.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt; Because lichens do not possess roots, their primary source of most [[chemical element|elements]] is the air, and therefore elemental levels in lichens often reflect the accumulated composition of ambient air. The processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include [[fog]] and [[dew]], gaseous absorption, and dry deposition.&lt;ref name=Knops1991/&gt; Consequently, many environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective [[bioindicator|biomonitors]] of atmospheric quality.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Halonen1993/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walker T.

Not all lichens are equally sensitive to [[air pollution|air pollutants]], so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants.&lt;ref name="hogan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |date=2010 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |work=Encyclopedia of Earth. |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=27 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |archivedate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity of a lichen to air pollution is directly related to the energy needs of the mycobiont, so that the stronger the dependency of the mycobiont on the photobiont, the more sensitive the lichen is to air pollution.&lt;ref name=Beltman1980/&gt; Upon exposure to air pollution, the photobiont may use metabolic energy for repair of its cellular structures that would otherwise be used for maintenance of its photosynthetic activity, therefore leaving less metabolic energy available for the mycobiont. The alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association. Therefore, lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances, but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other.&lt;ref name=Nash2008/&gt;

This interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859, with more systematic methods developed by [[William Nylander (botanist)|William Nylander]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

=== Food ===
[[File:Hiroshige II - Kishu kumano iwatake tori - Shokoku meisho hyakkei.jpg|thumb|[[Iwatake]] (''Umbilicaria esculenta'') gathering at Kumano in Kishū, by [[Hiroshige II]]]]
Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world. Although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine, others are a staple food or even a delicacy. Two obstacles are often encountered when eating lichens: lichen [[polysaccharide]]s are generally indigestible to humans, and lichens usually contain mildly toxic [[secondary compound]]s that should be removed before eating. Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in [[vulpinic acid]] or [[usnic acid]] are toxic.&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993"/&gt; Most poisonous lichens are yellow.

In the past, [[Iceland moss]] (''Cetraria islandica'') was an important source of food for humans in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. [[Wila (lichen)|Wila]] (''Bryoria fremontii'') was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer lichen]] (''Cladina'' spp.) after they remove it from the [[rumen]] of caribou or reindeer that have been killed. [[Rock Tripe|Rock tripe]] (''Umbilicaria'' spp. and ''Lasalia'' spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America, and one species, ''[[Umbilicaria esculenta]]'', is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.

=== Lichenometry ===
{{Main|Lichenometry}}
Lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli. Introduced by Beschel in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Beschel1950/&gt; the technique has found many applications. it is used in [[archaeology]], [[palaeontology]], and [[geomorphology]]. It uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the [[Surface exposure dating|age of exposed rock]].&lt;ref name=LSN/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;Curry, R. R. (1969) "Holocene climatic and glacial history of the central Sierra Nevada, California", pp. 1–47, Geological Society of America Special Paper, 123, S. A. Schumm and W. C. Bradley, eds.&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sowers, J. M., Noller, J. S., and Lettis, W. R. (eds.) (1997) ''Dating and Earthquakes: Review of Quaternary Geochronology and its Application to Paleoseismology''. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG/CR 5562.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period.&lt;ref name="innes"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/030913338500900202 |title=Lichenometry |journal=Progress in Physical Geography |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=187 |year=1985 |last1=Innes |first1=J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera ''[[Rhizocarpon]]'' (e.g. the species ''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'') and ''[[Xanthoria]]''.

===Biodegradation===
Lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of [[Baelo Claudia]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2227722|title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage|author1=Cappitelli, Francesca |author2=Sorlini, Claudia |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=2008|volume=74|issue=3|pmid=18065627|doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07|pages=564–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead, copper, and radionuclides.&lt;ref name=gadd/&gt;

=== As dyes ===
Many lichens produce secondary compounds, including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that reduce [[herbivory]] or kill bacteria. These compounds are very useful for lichen identification, and have had economic importance as [[dye]]s such as [[cudbear]] or primitive [[antibiotics]].

The [[pH indicator]] (indicated acidic or basic) in the [[litmus test]] is a dye extracted from the lichen ''[[Roccella tinctoria]]'' by boiling.

[[Traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands|In the Highlands of Scotland, traditional dyes]] for [[Harris tweed]]&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt; and other traditional cloths were made from lichens including the orange ''[[Xanthoria parietina]]'' and the grey foliaceous ''[[Parmelia saxatilis]]'' common on rocks known as "crottle".

There are reports dating almost 2000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes.&lt;ref name=Casselman1999/&gt; Of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family [[Roccellaceae]], commonly called orchella weed or orchil. [[Orcein]] and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.

===Traditional medicine and research===
Historically in [[traditional medicine]] of Europe, ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' was collected in large quantities as "Lungwort", due to its lung-like appearance (the ''[[doctrine of signatures]]'' suggesting that herbs can treat body parts that they physically resemble). Similarly, ''[[Peltigera leucophlebia]]'' was used as a supposed cure for [[candidiasis|thrush]], due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease.&lt;ref name=Dobson/&gt;

Lichens produce [[metabolite]]s in research for their potential therapeutic or diagnostic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = K | year = 2001 | title = Pharmaceutically Relevant Metabolites from Lichens | doi = 10.1007/s002530100684 | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities.&lt;ref name=morton&gt;Morton, E.; Winters, J. and Smith, L.

===In literature===
In early [[Midrashic]] literature, the Hebrew word "vayilafeth" in [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:8 is explained as referring to [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] entwining herself around [[Boaz]] like lichen.&lt;ref&gt;Thus explained by Rabbi [[Enoch Zundel ben Joseph]], in his commentary ''Etz Yosef'' ("Tree of Joseph"), on ''Sefer [[Midrash Rabbah]]'', vol. 2, New York 1987, s.v. ''Ruth Rabba'' 6:3&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth century Arab physician, [[Al-Tamimi, the physician|Al-Tamimi]], mentions lichens dissolved in [[vinegar]] and [[rose water]] being used in his day for the treatment of skin diseases and rashes.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Amar and Yaron Serri, ''The Land of Israel and Syria as Described by Al-Tamimi'', Ramat-Gan 2004, pp. 56, 108–109 {{ISBN|965-226-252-8}} (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of [[John Wyndham]]'s novel ''[[Trouble with Lichen]]'' revolves around an anti-aging chemical extracted from a lichen.

==History==

[[File:Haeckel Lichenes.jpg|thumb|"Lichenes" fancifully drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]] to emphasize his ideas of symmetry in his ''[[Kunstformen der Natur|Artforms of Nature]]'', 1904]]

Although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time, it was not until 1867, when Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]] proposed his dual theory of lichens, that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt; Schwendener's hypothesis, which at the time lacked experimental evidence, arose from his extensive analysis of the anatomy and development in lichens, algae, and fungi using a [[light microscopy|light microscope]]. Many of the leading lichenologists at the time, such as [[James Mascall Morrison Crombie|James Crombie]] and [[William Nylander (botanist)|Nylander]], rejected Schwendener's hypothesis because the common consensus was that all living organisms were autonomous.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;

Other prominent biologists, such as [[Heinrich Anton de Bary]], [[Albert Bernhard Frank]], [[Melchior Treub]] and [[Hermann Hellriegel]] were not so quick to reject Schwendener's ideas and the concept soon spread into other areas of study, such as microbial, plant, animal and human pathogens.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Treub1873/&gt; When the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified, Schwendener's hypothesis began to gain popularity. Further experimental proof of the dual nature of lichens was obtained when [[Eugen Thomas]] published his results in 1939 on the first successful re-synthesis experiment.&lt;ref name=Honegger2000/&gt;

In the 2010s, a new facet of the fungi-algae partnership was discovered. Toby Spribille and colleagues found that many types of lichen that were long thought to be [[ascomycota|ascomycete]]-algae pairs were actually ascomycete-[[basidiomycota|basidiomycete]]-algae trios.&lt;ref name="pmid_27445309"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yong_2016-07-21"&gt;{{Citation |last=Yong |first=Ed |author-link=Ed Yong |date=2016-07-21 |title=How a guy from a Montana trailer park overturned 150 years of biology |journal=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/how-a-guy-from-a-montana-trailer-park-upturned-150-years-of-biology/491702/ |access-date=2017-07-23 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA)''' is a tool to determine the most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] option among different competing alternatives to purchase, own, operate, maintain and, finally, dispose of an object or process, when each is equally appropriate to be implemented on technical grounds. For example, for a highway pavement, in addition to the initial construction cost, LCCA takes into account all the user costs, (e.g., reduced capacity at work zones), and agency costs related to future activities, including future periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present-day value known as [[net present value]] (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system.

In order to perform an LCCA scoping is critical - what aspects are to be included and what not?  If the scope becomes too large the tool may become impractical to use and of limited ability to help in decision-making and consideration of alternatives; if the scope is too small then the results may be skewed by the choice of factors considered such that the output becomes unreliable or partisan.  Usually, the LCCA term implies that environmental costs are not included, whereas the similar [[Whole-life cost|Whole-Life Costing]], or just [[Life Cycle Analysis]] (LCA), generally has a broader scope, including [[environmental costs]].
 
To help building and facility managers make sound decisions, the US [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP) provides guidance and resources on applying LCCA that permits the cost-effectiveness of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] and [[water efficiency]] investments to be evaluated (see [https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=907459 NIST Handbook 135]).  This document includes an introduction to LCCA.

Life cycle cost can be conducted in two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic method.

==Origin of name==
The first MADS-box gene to be identified was ''ARG80'' from budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',&lt;ref name="debjdfmf"&gt;Dubois E, Bercy J, Descamps F, Messenguy F: Characterization of two new genes essential for vegetative growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: nucleotide sequence determination and chromosome mapping. Gene 1987, 55:265-275.&lt;/ref&gt; but was at that time not recognized as a member of a large gene family. The MADS-box gene family got its name later as an acronym referring to the four founding members,&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; ignoring ''ARG80'':
* '''M'''CM1 from the budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',
* [[agamous|'''A'''GAMOUS]] from the thale cress ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'',

MADS-box genes were detected in nearly all eukaryotes studied.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt; While the genomes of animals and fungi generally possess only around one to five MADS-box genes, genomes of [[flowering plants]] have around 100 MADS-box genes.&lt;ref name="batg"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker A, Theissen G | title = The major clades of MADS-box genes and their role in the development and evolution of flowering plants | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–89 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14615187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two types of MADS-domain proteins are distinguished; the SRF-like or Type I MADS-domain proteins and the MEF2-like (after [[Mef2|MYOCYTE-ENHANCER-FACTOR2]]) or Type II MADS-domain proteins.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRF-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have a second conserved domain, the SAM (SRF, ARG80, MCM1) domain.&lt;ref name="spsad"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore P, Sharrocks AD | title = The MADS-box family of transcription factors | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 229 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7744019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have the [[MEF2]] domain as a second conserved domain.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; In plants, the MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins are also termed MIKC-type proteins referring to their conserved domain structure, where the MADS (M) domain is followed by an Intervening (I), a Keratin-like (K) and a [[C-terminal domain]].&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt; In plants, MADS-domain protein form tetramers and this is thought to be central for their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theissen G, Saedler H | title = Plant biology.

A [[genetics|geneticist]] intensely investigating MADS-box genes is [[Günter Theißen]] at the [[University of Jena]]. For example, he and his coworkers could show by these genes that the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Gnetum|Gnetales]] is related more closely to the [[Pinophyta|conifers]] than with the [[flowering plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winter KU, Becker A, Münster T, Kim JT, Saedler H, Theissen G | title = MADS-box genes reveal that gnetophytes are more closely related to conifers than to flowering plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 13 | pages = 7342–7 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10377416 | pmc = 22087 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function of MADS-box genes==
MADS-box genes have a variety of functions. In animals, MADS-box genes are involved in muscle development and [[cell proliferation]] and differentiation.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; Functions in fungi range from pheromone response to [[arginine]] metabolism.&lt;ref name="spsad"/&gt;

In plants, MADS-box genes are involved in controlling all major aspects of development, including male and female [[gametophyte]] development, embryo and seed development, as well as root, flower and fruit development.&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker" /&gt;

Some MADS-box genes of flowering plants have homeotic functions like the [[HOX genes]] of animals.&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; The floral homeotic MADS-box genes (such as ''AGAMOUS'' and ''DEFICIENS'') participate in the determination of floral organ identity according to the [[ABC model of flower development]].&lt;ref name="cesmem"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coen ES, Meyerowitz EM | title = The war of the whorls: genetic interactions controlling flower development | journal = Nature | volume = 353 | issue = 6339 | pages = 31–7 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1715520 | doi = 10.1038/353031a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of MADS-box genes is flowering time determination. In ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' the MADS box genes ''SOC1''&lt;ref name="pmid10852935"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onouchi H, Igeño MI, Périlleux C, Graves K, Coupland G | title = Mutagenesis of plants overexpressing CONSTANS demonstrates novel interactions among Arabidopsis flowering-time genes | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 885–900 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852935 | pmc = 149091 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.12.6.885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Flowering Locus C]]''&lt;ref name="pmid10330478"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michaels SD, Amasino RM | title = FLOWERING LOCUS C encodes a novel MADS domain protein that acts as a repressor of flowering | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 949–56 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10330478 | pmc = 144226 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.11.5.949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''FLC'') have been shown to have an important role in the integration of molecular flowering time pathways. These genes are essential for the correct timing of ''[[flowering]]'', and help to ensure that fertilization occurs at the time of maximal reproductive potential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21261">'''Microbial biodegradation''' is the use of [[bioremediation]] and [[biotransformation]] methods to harness the naturally occurring ability of microbial [[xenobiotic metabolism]] to degrade, transform or accumulate environmental pollutants, including [[hydrocarbon]]s (e.g. oil), [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[heterocyclic compounds]] (such as [[pyridine]] or [[quinoline]]), pharmaceutical substances, [[radionuclide]]s and metals.

Interest in the microbial biodegradation of [[pollutant]]s has intensified in recent years,&lt;ref name= KoukkouA-I&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Koukkou |editor1-first=Anna-Irini |year=2011 |title=Microbial Bioremediation of Non-metals: Current Research |publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] |isbn=978-1-904455-83-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Díaz |editor1-first=Eduardo |title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology |edition=1st |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent major methodological breakthroughs have enabled detailed genomic, metagenomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and other high-throughput analyses of environmentally relevant [[microorganism]]s, providing new insights into biodegradative pathways and the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Biological processes play a major role in the removal of [[contaminant]]s and take advantage of the catabolic versatility of microorganisms to degrade or convert such compounds.  In environmental [[microbiology]], [[genome]]-based global studies are increasing the understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks, as well as providing new information on the evolution of degradation pathways and molecular adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions.

==Aerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
The increasing amount of bacterial genomic data provides new opportunities for understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the degradation of organic [[pollutant]]s. [[Aromatic compounds]] are among the most persistent of these pollutants and lessons can be learned from the recent genomic studies of ''[[Burkholderia xenovorans]]'' LB400 and ''[[Rhodococcus]]'' sp. strain RHA1, two of the largest bacterial genomes completely sequenced to date. These studies have helped expand our understanding of bacterial [[catabolism]], non-catabolic physiological adaptation to [[organic compound]]s, and the evolution of large bacterial [[genome]]s. First, the [[metabolic pathway]]s from phylogenetically diverse isolates are very similar with respect to overall organization. Thus, as originally noted in [[pseudomonadaceae|pseudomonads]], a large number of "peripheral aromatic" pathways funnel a range of natural and [[xenobiotic]] compounds into a restricted number of "central aromatic" pathways. Nevertheless, these pathways are genetically organized in genus-specific fashions, as exemplified by the b-ketoadipate and Paa pathways. Comparative genomic studies further reveal that some pathways are more widespread than initially thought. Thus, the Box and Paa pathways illustrate the prevalence of non-oxygenolytic ring-cleavage strategies in aerobic aromatic degradation processes. Functional genomic studies have been useful in establishing that even organisms harboring high numbers of [[homologous enzymes]] seem to contain few examples of true redundancy. For example, the multiplicity of ring-cleaving dioxygenases in certain rhodococcal isolates may be attributed to the cryptic aromatic catabolism of different terpenoids and steroids. Finally, analyses have indicated that recent genetic flux appears to have played a more significant role in the evolution of some large genomes, such as LB400's, than others. However, the emerging trend is that the large gene repertoires of potent pollutant degraders such as LB400 and RHA1 have evolved principally through more ancient processes. That this is true in such phylogenetically diverse species is remarkable and further suggests the ancient origin of this catabolic capacity.&lt;ref name=chapter1&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=McLeod MP, Eltis LD|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights Into the Aerobic Pathways for Degradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
[[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic]] [[microbial]] mineralization of recalcitrant organic [[pollutant]]s is of great environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Lee|first3=Matthew|last4=Manefield|first4=Michael|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.|date=2015|title=Reductive Dehalogenases Come of Age in Biological Destruction of Organohalides|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=10|pages=595–610|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|issn=0167-7799|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[hydrocarbon]]s and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable in the absence of oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating [[bacteria]] during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly [[chlorinated]] compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] moieties in aromatic pesticides.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"&gt;Cupples, A. M., R. A. Sanford, and G. K. Sims.  2005. Dehalogenation of Bromoxynil (3,5-Dibromo-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) and Ioxynil (3,5-Diiodino-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) by [[Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans]].  Appl. Env. Micro. 71(7):3741-3746.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reactions, such as biologically induced [[abiotic]] reduction by soil minerals,&lt;ref&gt;Tor, J., C. Xu, J. M. Stucki, M. Wander, G. K. Sims. 2000. Trifluralin degradation under micro-biologically induced nitrate and Fe(III) reducing conditions.  Env. Sci. Tech. 34:3148-3152.&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments.  Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of [[genomics]] in the field of [[environmental microbiology]], a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb [[genome]] of the facultative denitrifying ''[[Aromatoleum aromaticum]]'' strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using [[toluene]] or [[ethylbenzene]] as [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]s). The [[genome sequence]] revealed about two dozen [[gene cluster]]s (including several [[paralog]]s) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and [[enzyme]] structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing ''[[Dechloromonas aromatica]]'' (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by [[halorespiration]]: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of ''[[Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' strain 195 and ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of ''[[Desulfitobacterium hafniense]]'' strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.&lt;ref name=chapter2&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Heider J, Rabus R|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights in the Anaerobic Biodegradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, it has become apparent that some organisms, including ''Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans'', originally evaluated for halorespiration on chlorophenols, can also use certain brominated compounds, such as the herbicide [[bromoxynil]] and its major metabolite as electron acceptors for growth.  Iodinated compounds may be dehalogenated as well, though the process may not satisfy the need for an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"/&gt;

==Bioavailability, chemotaxis, and transport of pollutants==
[[Bioavailability]], or the amount of a substance that is physiochemically accessible to [[microorganism]]s is a key factor in the efficient [[biodegradation]] of pollutants.  O'Loughlin ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = E. J | last2 = Traina | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Sims | first3 = G.

Toxicol. and Chem | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 2168–2174 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620190904}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that, with the exception of [[kaolinite]] clay, most soil clays and cation exchange resins attenuated biodegradation of [[2-picoline]] by ''[[Arthrobacter]]'' sp. strain R1, as a result of adsorption of the substrate to the clays.  [[Chemotaxis]], or the directed movement of motile organisms towards or away from chemicals in the environment is an important physiological response that may contribute to effective catabolism of molecules in the environment. In addition, mechanisms for the intracellular accumulation of aromatic molecules via various transport mechanisms are also important.&lt;ref name=chapter6&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Parales RE, etal |year=2008|chapter=Bioavailability, Chemotaxis, and Transport of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil biodegradation==
[[File:Biodegradation of Pollutants.png|thumb|General overview of microbial biodegradation of petroleum oil by microbial communities. Some microorganisms, such as ''A. borkumensis'', are able to use hydrocarbons as their source for carbon in metabolism. They are able to oxidize the environmentally harmful hydrocarbons while producing harmless products, following the general equation C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the figure, carbon is represented as yellow circles, oxygen as pink circles, and hydrogen as blue circles. This type of special metabolism allows these microbes to thrive in areas affected by oil spills and are important in the elimination of environmental pollutants.]]
[[Petroleum]] oil  contains aromatic compounds that are toxic to most life forms. Episodic and chronic [[pollution]] of the environment by oil causes major disruption to the local ecological environment. Marine environments in particular are especially vulnerable, as oil spills near coastal regions and in the open sea are difficult to contain and make mitigation efforts more complicated. In addition to pollution through human activities, approximately 250 million litres of petroleum enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Cholesterol biodegradation==
Many synthetic steroidic compounds like some sexual hormones frequently appear in municipal and industrial wastewaters, acting as environmental pollutants with strong metabolic activities negatively affecting the ecosystems. Since these compounds are common carbon sources for many different microorganisms their aerobic and anaerobic mineralization has been extensively studied. The interest of these studies lies on the biotechnological applications of sterol transforming enzymes for the industrial synthesis of sexual hormones and corticoids. Very recently, the catabolism of cholesterol has acquired a high relevance because it is involved in the infectivity of the pathogen ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (''Mtb'').&lt;ref name="KoukkouA-I"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=Matthew, F.|last2=Sampson|first2=Nicole, S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Suzanne, T.|title=Pathogen roid rage: Cholesterol utilization by Mycobacterium tuberculosis|journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol|date=2014|doi=10.3109/10409238.2014.895700|pmid=24611808|volume=49|issue=4|pages=269–93|pmc=4255906}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mtb'' causes [[tuberculosis]] disease, and it has been demonstrated that novel enzyme architectures have evolved to bind and modify steroid compounds like cholesterol in this organism and other steroid-utilizing bacteria as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=S.T.|last2=Sampson|first2=N.S.|title=Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes a unique heterotetrameric structure for dehydrogenation of the cholesterol side chain|journal=Biochemistry|date=2013|volume=52|issue=17|pages=2895–2904|doi=10.1021/bi4002979|pmid=23560677|pmc=3726044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=M.F.|last2=Yang|first2=M.|last3=Thomas|first3=S.T.|last4=Sampson|first4=N.S.|title=Shrinking the FadE Proteome of ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'': Insights into Cholesterol Metabolism through Identification of an α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Heterotetrameric Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Family|journal=J.

==Analysis of waste biotreatment==
Sustainable development requires the promotion of environmental management and a constant search for new technologies to treat vast quantities of wastes generated by increasing [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities. Biotreatment, the processing of wastes using living organisms, is an environmentally friendly, relatively simple and cost-effective alternative to physico-chemical clean-up options. Confined environments, such as [[bioreactors]], have been engineered to overcome the physical, chemical and biological limiting factors of biotreatment processes in highly controlled systems. The great versatility in the design of confined environments allows the treatment of a wide range of wastes under optimized conditions. To perform a correct assessment, it is necessary to consider various microorganisms having a variety of [[genome]]s and expressed transcripts and proteins. A great number of analyses are often required. Using traditional genomic techniques, such assessments are limited and time-consuming. However, several high-throughput techniques originally developed for medical studies can be applied to assess biotreatment in confined environments.&lt;ref name=chapter10&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Watanabe K, Kasai Y|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Emerging Technologies to Analyze Natural Attenuation and Bioremediation|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolic engineering and biocatalytic applications==
The study of the fate of persistent organic chemicals in the environment has revealed a large reservoir of enzymatic reactions with a large potential in preparative organic synthesis, which has already been exploited for a number of [[oxygenase]]s on pilot and even on industrial scale. Novel catalysts can be obtained from [[metagenomic]] libraries and [[DNA sequence]] based approaches. Our increasing capabilities in adapting the catalysts to specific reactions and process requirements by rational and random [[mutagenesis]] broadens the scope for application in the fine chemical industry, but also in the field of [[biodegradation]]. In many cases, these catalysts need to be exploited in whole cell [[bioconversion]]s or in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]s, calling for system-wide approaches to understanding strain physiology and metabolism and rational approaches to the engineering of whole cells as they are increasingly put forward in the area of systems [[biotechnology]] and synthetic biology.&lt;ref name=chapter12&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Meyer A, Panke S|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomics in Metabolic Engineering and Biocatalytic Applications of the Pollutant Degradation Machinery|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal biodegradation==
In the ecosystem, different substrates are attacked at different rates by consortia of organisms from different kingdoms. ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and other [[mould]]s play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers. Some aspergilli are capable of degrading more refractory compounds such as fats, oils, chitin, and keratin. Maximum decomposition occurs when there is sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus and other essential inorganic nutrients. Fungi also provide food for many soil organisms.&lt;ref name="MachidaMGomiK"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Machida |editor1-first=Masayuki |editor2-last=Gomi |editor2-first=Katsuya |year=2010 |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Aspergillus'' the process of degradation is the means of obtaining nutrients. When these moulds degrade human-made substrates, the process usually is called biodeterioration. Both paper and textiles (cotton, jute, and linen) are particularly vulnerable to ''Aspergillus'' degradation. Our artistic heritage is also subject to ''Aspergillus'' assault. To give but one example, after Florence in Italy flooded in 1969, 74% of the isolates from a damaged Ghirlandaio fresco in the Ognissanti church were ''Aspergillus versicolor''.&lt;ref name="Bennettjw"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bennett JW |year=2010 |chapter=An Overview of the Genus ''Aspergillus'' |chapter-url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617021430/http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13113">'''New Criticism''' was a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]] that dominated [[American literature|American]] [[literary criticism]] in the middle decades of the 20th century. It emphasized [[close reading]], particularly of [[poetry]], to discover how a work of literature functioned as a self-contained, self-referential aesthetic object. The movement derived its name from [[John Crowe Ransom]]'s 1941 book ''The New Criticism''.

The work of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholar [[I. A. Richards]], especially his  ''Practical Criticism'' and ''The Meaning of Meaning'', which offered what was claimed to be an empirical scientific approach, were important to the development of New Critical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Steven. ''Texts and Contexts: Writing about Literature with Critical Theory''. Addison-Wesley, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Also very influential were the [[T. S. Eliot#Literary Criticism|critical essays]] of [[T. S. Eliot]], such as "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]" and "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]", in which Eliot developed his notion of the "[[objective correlative]]". Eliot's evaluative judgments, such as his condemnation of Milton and Dryden, his liking for the so-called [[metaphysical poets]] and his insistence that poetry must be impersonal, greatly influenced the formation of the New Critical canon.

==Formalism theory==
New Criticism developed as a reaction to the older philological and literary history schools of the US North, which, influenced by nineteenth-century German scholarship, focused on the history and meaning of individual words and their relation to foreign and ancient languages, comparative sources, and the biographical circumstances of the authors. These approaches, it was felt, tended to distract from the text and meaning of a poem and entirely neglect its aesthetic qualities in favor of teaching about external factors. On the other hand, the literary appreciation school, which limited itself to pointing out the "beauties" and morally elevating qualities of the text, was disparaged by the New Critics as too subjective and emotional. Condemning this as a version of Romanticism, they aimed for newer, systematic and objective method.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was felt, especially by creative writers and by literary critics outside the academy, that the special aesthetic experience of poetry and literary language was lost in the welter of extraneous erudition and emotional effusions. Heather Dubrow notes that the prevailing focus of literary scholarship was on "the study of ethical values and philosophical issues through literature, the tracing of literary history, and ... political criticism". Literature was approached  and literary scholarship did not focus on analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dubrow, Heather. "Twentieth Century Shakespeare Criticism." ''The Riverside Shakespeare''. Houghton Mifflin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Critics believed the structure and meaning of the text were intimately connected and should not be analyzed separately. In order to bring the focus of literary studies back to analysis of the texts, they aimed to exclude the reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. These goals were articulated in Ransom's "Criticism, Inc." and [[Allen Tate]]'s "Miss Emily and the Bibliographers".

Close reading (or ''explication de texte'') was a staple of French literary studies, but in the United States, aesthetic concerns, and the study of modern poets was the province of non-academic essayists and book reviewers rather than serious scholars. The New Criticism changed this. Though their interest in textual study initially met with resistance from older scholars, the methods of the New Critics rapidly predominated in American universities until challenged by Feminism and [[structuralism]] in the 1970s. Other schools of critical theory, including, [[post-structuralism]], and [[Deconstruction|deconstructionist theory]], the [[New Historicism]], and Receptions studies followed.

Although the New Critics were never a formal group, an important inspiration was the teaching of [[John Crowe Ransom]] of [[Vanderbilt University]], whose students (all Southerners), [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]] would go on to develop the aesthetics that came to be known as the New Criticism. Indeed, for Paul Lauter, a Professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], New Criticism is a reemergence of the [[Southern Agrarians]].&lt;ref name="versionsofnashville"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title="Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=195 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, "The New Criticism", Cleanth Brooks notes that "The New Critic, like the [[Snark (Lewis Carroll)|Snark]], is a very elusive beast", meaning that there was no clearly defined "New Critical" manifesto, school, or stance.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87: 4 (1979): 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of writings outline inter-related New Critical ideas.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]", which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hey-day of the New Criticism in American high schools and colleges was the Cold War decades between 1950 and the mid-seventies. Brooks and Warren's ''Understanding Poetry'' and ''Understanding Fiction'' both became staples during this era.

Studying a passage of prose or poetry in New Critical style required careful, exacting scrutiny of the passage itself. Formal elements such as [[rhyme]], meter, [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[characterization]], and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] were used to identify the [[theme (literature)|theme]] of the text. In addition to the theme, the New Critics also looked for [[paradox]], [[ambiguity]], [[irony]], and [[Suspense|tension]] to help establish the single best and most unified interpretation of the text.

Although the New Criticism is no longer a dominant theoretical model in American universities, some of its methods (like [[close reading]]) are still fundamental tools of literary criticism, underpinning a number of subsequent theoretic approaches to literature including poststructuralism, deconstruction theory, and [[reader-response theory]].

==Criticism==
It was frequently alleged that the New Criticism treated literary texts as autonomous and divorced from historical context, and that its practitioners were  “uninterested in the human meaning, the social function and effect of literature.” &lt;ref name="Wellek"&gt;Wellek, René. “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra.” ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 4, No. 4. (Summer, 1978), pp. 611–624. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342947].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jancovich"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jancovich | first = Mark | title = The Cultural Politics of the New Criticism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-41652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicative of the [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response school of theory]], Terence Hawkes writes that the fundamental close reading technique is based on the assumption that “the subject and the object of study—the reader and the text—are stable and independent forms, rather than products of the unconscious process of signification," an assumption which he identifies as the "ideology of liberal humanism,” which is attributed to the New Critics who are “accused of attempting to disguise the interests at work in their critical processes.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt; For Hawkes, ideally, a critic ought to be considered to “[create] the finished work by his reading of it, and [not to] remain simply an inert consumer of a ‘ready-made’ product.”&lt;ref name="Jancovich"/&gt;

In response to critics like Hawkes, Cleanth Brooks, in his essay "The New Criticism" (1979), argued that the New Criticism was not diametrically opposed to the general principles of reader-response theory and that the two could complement one another. For instance, he stated, "If some of the New Critics have preferred to stress the writing rather than the writer, so have they given less stress to the reader—to the reader's response to the work. Yet no one in his right mind could forget the reader. He is essential for 'realizing' any poem or novel. . .Reader response is certainly worth studying." However, Brooks tempers his praise for the reader-response theory by noting its limitations, pointing out that, "to put meaning and valuation of a literary work at the mercy of any and every individual [reader] would reduce the study of literature to reader psychology and to the history of taste." &lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "The New Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 87:4 (1979) 598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to the New Criticism is that it is thought to aim at making criticism scientific, or at least “bringing literary study to a condition rivaling that of science.”&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt; [[René Wellek]], however, points out the erroneous nature of this criticism by noting that a number of the New Critics outlined their theoretical aesthetics in stark contrast to the "objectivity" of the sciences (although Ransom, in his essay "Criticism, Inc." did advocate that "criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic").&lt;ref name="Wellek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. "Criticism, Inc." ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', Autumn 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Wellek defended the New Critics in his essay “The New Criticism: Pro and Contra” (1978).

'''Postgraduate research''' represents a formal area of study that is recognized by a university or institute of higher learning. By definition, the notion of “postgraduate” ([[United States]]) carries the implication that the candidate undertaking such research has already completed a formal [[Master's degree]] and at some instances the [[Doctor of Philosophy |PhD]], at an accredited university or tertiary institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniguru.co.in/studyabroad/postgraduate/us-usa/all-university-courses/harvard-university-courses/72040/1/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting qualifications arising from postgraduate research leads to Post ([[Doctorate]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridge.net/us/harvard-academics-courses-research/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Structure==
The structure of postgraduate research programs can vary significantly from one country to another.  To enter into a PhD program in the United States, students generally must have some form of prerequisite study beyond their basic graduate qualification. This may be a Master’s coursework program, which acts as a qualifier for entry.  In other countries, entry to Doctoral or Master’s research programs is based on the academic track record of the candidates in their undergraduate degrees.

Many students confuse the notion of postgraduate research with “invention” and “discovery”.  Postgraduate research ultimately represents an apprenticeship in the field of research.  In his textbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctortee.net/KeyFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key Factors in Postgraduate Research – A Guide for Students''. Dario Toncich explains that the objective of postgraduate research is not necessarily to make a breakthrough invention or, indeed, a major scientific discovery.  

It is, rather, a mechanism by which graduate students learn how to undertake a systematic investigation, founded upon the work built by peers in the field, and then to extend the current state of knowledge.  In the context of assessing a postgraduate research program, it is generally the systematic process of research and investigation that is given more attention than the level to which knowledge is extended.  The title "doctor" emanates from the Latin word ''docera''&amp;mdash;to teach.  Hence there is an expectation that the recipient of a doctorate would go on to become some form of "teacher" in the broad sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/ifc_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, postgraduate research was a rarity, with countries such as the United States only having a small number of candidates across their university spectrum.  However, by the start of the 21st century, postgraduate research, and postgraduate qualifications, had become commonplace.  In any one year, at a global level, there are hundreds of thousands of candidates undertaking postgraduate research programs.  For this reason the nature of postgraduate research has also changed.  

At Doctoral level, there is some recognition that it is no longer reasonable to expect major research breakthroughs as part of a postgraduate research program.  To this end, Doctoral research more commonly now represents an extension of knowledge, rather than some form of breakthrough.  There is also some recognition that modern postgraduate research programs now have to be conducted in the light of massive amounts of previously published work, and hence the [[literature review]] process has become significantly more complex.

The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another. Postgraduate research programs generally result in a thesis/dissertation, which is assessed by independent experts in the field.  The specific nature of the thesis varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another.  In addition, some universities insist that students also undertake a ''viva-voce'' oral examination in which they can defend their research and processes before an expert panel.

In [[India]], generally, the higher the level of the research degree the less association it has with a specific discipline.  For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a [[Bachelor of Science |BS]]c(Chemistry).  At Master's level, the corresponding degree would be an MSc (without the specific subdiscipline).  At Doctoral level, the degree would be simply PhD with no discipline stated.  This is intended to show that the recipient of the award has mastered techniques that are more generic than those encapsulated in a specific discipline or subdiscipline.  There are some exceptions to this.  In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.edu/fpm/ProgrammeStructure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In some universities, it is also possible for candidates to achieve what is referred to as a "higher doctorate".  This is generally an award bestowed upon people who have made a substantial contribution to their discipline through their research.  Higher doctorates would normally be awarded after a significant research career and therefore those who receive such awards generally already have a basic PhD to begin with.  Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates generally carry the title of the discipline to which the research contributions have been made&amp;mdash;for example, Doctor of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/doctoral/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pac-schema.png|400px|thumb|right|The structure of an application with PAC.]]
'''Presentation–abstraction–control''' ('''PAC''') is a software [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]]. It is an interaction-oriented software architecture, and is somewhat similar to [[model–view–controller]] (MVC) in that it separates an interactive system into three types of components responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality. The '''abstraction''' component retrieves and processes the data, the '''presentation''' component formats the visual and audio presentation of data, and the '''control''' component handles things such as the flow of control and communication between the other two components.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to MVC, PAC is used as a hierarchical structure of agents, each consisting of a triad of presentation, abstraction and control parts. The agents (or triads) communicate with each other only through the control part of each triad. It also differs from MVC in that within each triad, it completely insulates the presentation (view in MVC) and the abstraction (model in MVC). This provides the option to separately multithread the model and view which can give the user experience of very short program start times, as the user interface (presentation) can be shown before the abstraction has fully initialized.

PAC was initially developed by [[France|French]] computer scientist, [[Joëlle Coutaz]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hcipioneers.wordpress.com/portfolio/coutaz-joelle/|title=Coutaz, Joëlle|date=2015-12-05|work=Encounters with HCI Pioneers - A Personal Photo Journal|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutaz|first=Joëlle|date=1987-10-01|title=PAC: AN OBJECT ORIENTED MODEL FOR IMPLEMENTING USER INTERFACES|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=36111.1045592|journal=ACM SIGCHI Bulletin|volume=19|issue=2|pages=37–41|doi=10.1145/36111.1045592|issn=0736-6906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coutaz founded the User Interface group at the Laboratorire de Génie Informatique of IMAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiV8CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=02PAwG6c8X&amp;dq=Jo%C3%ABlle%20Coutaz%20pac&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=Jo%C3%ABlle%20Coutaz%20pac&amp;f=false|title=Engineering for HCI|last=Unger|first=Claus|last2=Bass|first2=Leonard J.|date=2016-01-09|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780387349077|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E. Sharpe 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in [[sustainable agriculture]] and to an extent [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="What are Renewable Resources"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea79e/ch05.htm What are “Renewable Resources”?], by A. John Armstrong, Esq. &amp; Dr. Jan Hamrin, Chapter 1, The Renewable Energy Policy Manual, Organization of American States, undated. Retrieved 2013-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Paul Alfred Weiss]] defined Renewable Resources as: "''The total range of living organisms providing man with food, fibres, etc...''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Renewable Resources, a report to the committee on natural resources |author=Paul Weiss chairman of renewable resources study |year=1962 |publisher=National Academy of Science, National Research Council, Washington D.C., USA. |url=http://www.general-books.net/book.cfm?id=379739 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of renewable resources is [[renewable energy]] resources. Common sources of renewable energy include solar, geothermal and wind power, which are all categorised as renewable resources.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non agricultural food===
[[File:Alaska wild berries.jpg|thumb|right|Alaska wild "berries" from the [[Innoko National Wildlife Refuge]] - Renewable Resources]]
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/agnic/susag.shtml What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|250px|Polyculture practices in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]
{{main article|Energy crop|Non-food crop}}
An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
&lt;ref Name=unece&gt;[http://www.unece.org/unece-main/info-resources/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2012/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe.html Wood confirmed as the primary source of renewable energy in Europe, UNECE February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/am859e/am859e08.pdf FAO Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=woodecon&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575771-environmental-lunacy-europe-fuel-future  Wood The fuel of the future] Environmental lunacy in Europe, Economist title story Apr 6th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between [[energy crop]]s and [[non-food crop]]s. A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]]. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by [[fief]] obligations were in so far common in historical times as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/download/livestockhousing-e_01.pdf A short history of livestock production]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, J. Hartung, in Livestock housing, Modern management to ensure optimal health and welfare of farm animals, edited by: Andres Aland and Thomas Banhazi, © 2013 {{ISBN|978-90-8686-217-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into [[livestock]], which provides as well organic fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Comberg, Die deutsche Tierzucht im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Ulmer, 1984, {{ISBN|3-8001-3061-0}}, (History of livestock breeding in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes,  drove engines as e.g. in [[treadmill]]s.

Other regions solved the transportation problem with [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], [[urban agriculture|urban]] and garden agriculture.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment. By Joachim Radkau. Publications of the German Historical Institute Series. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions.

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===
[[Image:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deforestation===

{{main article|Deforestation}}
[[File:Deforestation Carceres Braasil 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] 1996]]
Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama. TakingITGlobal. 18 July 2006. Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]]. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation |work=UN Secretary-General’s Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |archivedate=2001-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805191140/http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm |title=China's floods: Is deforestation to blame? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities.

It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

{{Ecological economics|People}}
'''Robert Underwood Ayres''' (born June 29, 1932) is an American-born physicist and economist. His career has focused on the application of physical ideas, especially the laws of [[thermodynamics]], to [[economics]]; a long-standing pioneering interest in material flows and transformations ([[industrial ecology]] or [[industrial metabolism]])—a concept which he originated.&lt;ref name=AyresBio2010/&gt; His most recent work challenges the widely held [[Economic growth|economic theory of growth]].

==Career==
Trained as a physicist at the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[King's College London]] (PhD in Mathematical Physics), Ayres has dedicated his professional life to advancing the environment, technology and resource end of the [[sustainability]] agenda. His major research interests include technological change, [[environmental economics]], "industrial metabolism" and "eco-restructuring". He has worked at the [[Hudson Institute]] (1962–67), Resources for the Future Inc (1968) and International Research and Technology Corp (1969–76). From 1979 until 1992 he was Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, except for two years (and six summers) on leave at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg Austria. In 1992 he moved to the international business school [[INSEAD]] in Fontainebleau, France as Sandoz (later Novartis) Professor of Environment and Management. Since his formal retirement in 2000 he has been Jubilee Visiting Professor (2000–2001) and king Karl Gustav XVI professor of environmental science (2004–2005) at [[Chalmers Institute of Technology]] Gothenburg (Sweden). He is currently an Institute Scholar at IIASA.

He remains an active researcher. He has written or co-authored 20 books, edited or coedited another dozen books, written or co-authored more than 200 journal articles and book chapters not to mention many unpublished reports, on subjects ranging from environmental effects of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] to theoretical economics. But most of his life-work is [[interdisciplinary]]. He was a pioneer of a new field, sometimes called Industrial Metabolism or [[Industrial Ecology]]. He has contributed to [[futures studies]], [[technological forecasting]], transportation and energy studies, material flow studies (`dematerialization'), environmental technology, [[environmental economics]], thermodynamics and economics, and the theory of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/profiles/rayres/ |title=insead - faculty &amp; research - Robert U. Ayres |publisher=Insead.edu |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here taken from one of his recent papers are two paragraphs that provide a flavor of his recent work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mainstream economics today is based to a large extent on bad ideas. Economic concepts, from foundational issues like markets, supply and demand and “free trade”,  to money and finance, lack any systematic awareness of the physical process of production or the implications of the Laws of Thermodynamics  for those processes. A corollary, almost worthy of being a separate bad idea on its own, is that energy doesn’t matter (much) because the cost share of energy in the economy is so small that it can be ignored e.g. {Denison, 1984 #6184}. The so-called “production functions” used by all schools of economic thought that build growth models omit any necessary role for energy, as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone—or as if energy is merely a form of man-made capital that can be produced (as opposed to extracted) by labor and capital.

The essential truth missing from economic education today is that energy is the stuff of the universe, that all matter is also a form of energy, and that the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services. This is a thermodynamic process, as the Rumanian economist Georgescu-Roegen said half a century ago (Georgescu-Roegen 1971). The economic process is subject to both the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of mass/energy; nothing can be created or destroyed) and the second law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy; all transformation processes are irreversible). The “first law” implies that the notion of “consumption” as applied to products is misleading: material transformation processes unavoidably generate large quantities of material wastes or residuals {Ayres, 1969 #284;{Ayres, 1989 #424}.  Some of those wastes are merely inconvenient but others are harmful or toxic. The second law says that energy becomes less useful (exergy is destroyed) by every action.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is much more to be said along these lines. Key publications reflecting these (and some other) important ideas are given in the bibliography below.

[[Image:Roso schola copia.jpg|thumb|280px|Inauguration of the “House of the Philosopher” of the Schola Philosophicae Initiationis. On first plane there appear Mario Roso de Luna and Eduardo Alfonso.]]

The '''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis''' (School of Philosophical Initiation) was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[splinter group]] created in [[Madrid]] in 1928 by Eduardo Alfonso and [[Mario Roso de Luna]] in response to what they considered the doctrinal deviations of the [[Theosophical Society]], especially in reference to the proclamation of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[Theosophical Society#"The "World Teacher"|World Teacher]].

==Foundation==

In mid-1921, Mario Roso de Luna, with a dozen companions from Madrid, formed the ''Rama Hesperia,'' which kept close ties with the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] in [[India]] as well as with the dissident [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]] in [[California]]. Around 1928,  Roso de Luna and his group founded the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiatic]] philosophical school ''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis'' (SPI) that was "a reaction against the instability and indiscipline of the Theosophical Society."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: El porvenir de la Teosofía comprometido por la Sociedad Teosófica&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the SPI were "the comparative study of the philosophies, sciences and arts in their mutual relations, and promoting the health and culture of its members as well as their moral progress".&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: La Casa del Filósofo&lt;/ref&gt;

The new School bought a property in [[Manzanares el Real]] in the [[Community of Madrid]] to build a center for advanced philosophical studies called ''The House of the Philosopher''. The School was based on three stages of knowledge "as corresponds to any initiatic society and consequently to the three objects of the Theosophical Society, that deep inside are nothing but the three initiatic grades of all corresponding institutions which, having been misunderstood and disrespected, have led the T.S. to disunity and mental anarchy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The disciples of the SPI followed a gradual and methodical program of studies covering the three stages: the first, studies on [[Hygiene]] and [[Morality|Morals]]; the second on [[Science]] and [[Nature]]; and the third on [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]].

==Decline and dissolution==

Mario Roso de Luna died in 1931, after which Dr. Eduardo Alfonso became the head of the School, continuing the instruction of disciples. However, after 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] caused the suspension of many of the philosophical and cultural activities in Madrid. At the end of the Civil War, Eduardo Alfonso was tried according to the “Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism” and sentenced to several years of imprisonment which he served in a Burgos prison from 1942 to 1948. After serving his time, Alfonso was exiled to Latin America until 1966 when he returned to his Country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">'''Simple interactive object extraction''' ('''SIOX''') is an algorithm for extracting foreground objects from color images and videos with very little user interaction.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been implemented as "foreground selection" tool in the [[GIMP]] (since version 2.3.3), as part of the tracer tool in [[Inkscape]] (since 0.44pre3), and as function in [[ImageJ]] and [[FIJI Image processing software|Fiji]] (plug-in). Experimental implementations were also reported for [[Blender (software)|Blender]] and [[Krita]]. Although the algorithm was originally designed for videos, virtually all implementations use SIOX primarily for still image segmentation. In fact, it is often said to be the current [[de facto standard]] for this task in the [[open-source]] world.
 
Initially, a free hand selection tool is used to specify the region of interest. It must contain all foreground objects to extract and as few background as possible. The pixels outside the region of interest form the sure background while the inner region define a superset of the foreground, i.e. the unknown region. A so-called foreground brush is then used to mark representative foreground regions. The algorithm outputs a selection mask. The selection can be refined by either adding further foreground markings or by adding background markings using the background brush.

Technically, the algorithm performs the following steps: 
* Create a set of representative colors for sure foreground and sure background, the so-called color signatures.
* Assign all image points to foreground or background by a weighted nearest neighbor search in the color signatures.
* Apply some standard image processing operations like erode, dilate, and blur to remove artifacts.
* Find the connected foreground components that are either large enough or marked by the user.

For video segmentation the sure background and sure foreground regions are learned from motion statistics. SIOX also features tools that allow sub-pixel accurate refinement of edges and high texture areas, the so-called "detail refinement brushes".

As with all [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] algorithms, there are always pictures where the algorithm does not yield perfect results. The most critical drawback of SIOX is the color dependence. Although many photos are well-separable by color, the algorithm cannot deal with camouflage. If the foreground and background share many identical shades of similar colors, the algorithm might give a result with parts missing or incorrectly classified foreground. SIOX performs about equally well on different benchmarks compared to graph-based segmentation methods, such as [[Grabcut]]. SIOX is, however, more noise robust and can therefore also be used for the segmentation of videos. Graph-based segmentation methods search for a minimum cut and therefore tend to not perform optimally with complex structures.

The algorithm has initially been developed at the department of computer science at [[Freie Universitaet Berlin]]. The main developer, [[Gerald Friedland]], is now faculty at the EECS department of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] and also a Principal Data Scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore National Lab]]. He continues to support the development through mentoring, e.g. in the [[Google Summer of Code]].

[[File:VectraFrontSubframeBMuseum.JPG|thumb|upright|Front subframe of a [[Opel Vectra|Vauxhall Vectra]] on display in [[Bedford Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Bedford Museum]]]] 
A '''subframe''' is a structural component of a vehicle, such as an [[automobile]] or an [[aircraft]], that uses a discrete, separate structure within a larger [[body-on-frame]] or [[monocoque|unit body]] to carry certain components, such as the [[engine]], drivetrain, or [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. The subframe is [[Screw|bolted]] and/or [[welding|welded]] to the vehicle. When bolted, it is sometimes equipped with [[rubber]] [[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]] or [[Spring (device)|springs]] to [[Damping|dampen]] [[oscillation|vibration]].

The principal purposes of using a subframe are, to spread high chassis loads over a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a monocoque body shell, and to isolate vibration and harshness from the rest of the body. For example, in an automobile with its powertrain contained in a subframe, forces generated by the engine and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] can be damped enough that they will not disturb passengers. As a natural development from a car with a full chassis, separate front and rear subframes are used in modern vehicles to reduce the overall weight and cost. In addition a subframe yields benefits to production in that subassemblies can be made which can be introduced to the main bodyshell when required on an automated line.

There are generally three basic forms of the subframe.
# A simple "axle" type which usually carries the lower control arms and steering rack.
# A perimeter frame which carries the above components but in addition supports the engine.
# A perimeter frame which carries the above components but in addition supports the engine, transmission and possibly full suspension. (As used on front wheel drive cars)

A subframe is usually made of [[pressed steel]] panels that are much thicker than bodyshell panels, which are welded or [[spot welded]] together. The use of [[Hydroforming|hydroformed]] tubes may also be used.

The revolutionary [[monocoque]] [[transverse engine]]d [[front wheel drive]] 1959 [[Austin Mini]], that set the template for modern front wheel drive cars, used front and rear subframes to provide accurate road wheel control while using a stiff lightweight body. The 1961 [[Jaguar E-type]] or XKE used a tubular [[spaceframe]] type front subframe to mount the engine gearbox and long bonnet / hood, to a monocoque 'tub' passenger compartment.
&lt;!-- This sentence merged from [[sub frame]] article --&gt;
The subframe saw regular production in the 1960s and 1970s General Motors [[GM X platform (RWD)|X platform]] and [[GM F platform|F platform]] bodies and the 1985-05 M platform vans ([[Chevrolet Astro|Astro]], Safari).

Subframes are prone to misalignment, which can cause vibration and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components. Misalignment is caused by space between the chassis-subframe mounting bolts and the mounting hole. There are a number of companies in the automotive aftermarket that offer solutions for the subframe misalignment and movement issue, including TyrolSport of the USA and Spoon Sports of Japan.
