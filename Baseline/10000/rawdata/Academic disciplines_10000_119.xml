== Adoption ==
The development of web 2.0 has changed the research publication seeking and sharing within or outside the academy, but also provides new innovative constructs to measure the broad scientific impact of scholar work. Although the traditional metrics are useful, they might be insufficient to measure immediate and uncited impacts, especially outside the peer-review realm.&lt;ref name="Altmetrics-Manifesto-2011" /&gt;

Projects such as [[ImpactStory]],&lt;ref name="Insights-ImpactStory-2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jean|author2=Euan Adie|title=New perspectives on article-level metrics: developing ways to assess research uptake and impact online|journal=Insights|date=8 July 2013|volume=26|issue=2|page=153|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.79|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Impactstory-About"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impactstory: About|url=https://impactstory.org/about|work=[[ImpactStory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various companies, including [[Altmetric]],&lt;ref name="Insights-ImpactStory-2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Altmetric-About"&gt;{{cite web|title=Altmetric: About us|url=https://www.altmetric.com/about-us/|work=[[Altmetric]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plum Analytics]]&lt;ref name="Insights-ImpactStory-2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JERML-PlumX-2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindsay|first1=J.

In 2008, the [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]] started to systematically collect tweets about its articles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Can tweets predict citations?

However, it is also observed that an article needs little attention to jump to the [[Quartile|upper quartile]] of ranked papers,&lt;ref name=Infiniflux-AltmetricRankings-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Joel|title=Altmetric rankings|url=http://infiniflux.blogspot.ca/2013/08/altmetric-rankings.html|website=Infiniflux|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that not enough sources of altmetrics are currently available to give a balanced picture of impact for the majority of papers.

Important in determining the relative impact of a paper, a service that calculates altmetrics statistics needs a considerably sized knowledge base. The following table shows the number of papers covered by services:

== Categories ==
Altmetrics are a very broad group of metrics, capturing various parts of impact a paper or work can have. A classification of altmetrics was proposed by ImpactStory in September 2012,&lt;ref name="NewFramework"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/09/14/31524247207/ |title=A new framework for altmetrics |publisher=ImpactStory Blog |date=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a very similar classification is used by the Public Library of Science:&lt;ref name="Lin2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = J. | last2 = Fenner | first2 = M. | doi = 10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.04 | title = Altmetrics in Evolution: Defining and Redefining the Ontology of Article-Level Metrics | journal = Information Standards Quarterly | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 20 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Viewed - HTML views and PDF downloads
* Discussed - journal comments, science blogs, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook and other social media
* Saved - [[Mendeley]], [[CiteULike]] and other social bookmarks
* Cited - citations in the scholarly literature, tracked by [[Web of Science]], [[Scopus]], [[CrossRef]] and others
* Recommended - for example used by F1000Prime&lt;ref&gt;[http://f1000.com/prime F1000Prime]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewed ===
One of the first alternative metrics to be used was the number of views of a paper. Traditionally, an author would wish to publish in a journal with a high subscription rate, so many people would have access to the research. With the introduction of web technologies it became possible to actually count how often a single paper was looked at. Typically, publishers count the number of HTML views and PDF views. As early as 2004, the ''[[BMJ]]'' published the number of views for its articles, which was found to be somewhat correlated to citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7465.546 |title=Relation between online "hit counts" and subsequent citations: Prospective study of research papers in the BMJ |year=2004 |last1=Perneger |first1=T. V |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7465 |pages=546–7 |pmid=15345629 |pmc=516105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussed ===
The discussion of a paper can be seen as a metric that captures the potential impact of a paper. Typical sources of data to calculate this metric include [[Facebook]], [[Google+]], [[Twitter]], Science Blogs, and Wikipedia pages. Some researchers regard the mentions on social media as citations. For example, citations on a social media platform could be divided into two categories: internal and external. For instance, the former includes retweets, the latter refers to tweets containing links to outside documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/45772|title=Citations in Web 2.0|last=Weller|first=Katrin|last2=Peters|first2=Isabella|date=2012|publisher=Düsseldorf Univ. Press|isbn=9783943460162|editor-last=Tokar|editor-first=Alexander|pages=209–222|language=en|editor-last2=Beurskens|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Keuneke|editor-first3=Susanne|editor-last4=Mahrt|editor-first4=Merja|editor-last5=Peters|editor-first5=Isabella|editor-last6=Puschmann|editor-first6=Cornelius|editor-last7=Treeck|editor-first7=Timo van|editor-last8=Weller|editor-first8=Katrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between the mentions and likes and citation by primary scientific literature has been studied, and a slight correlation at best was found, e.g. for articles in [[PubMed]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2008 the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' began publishing views and [[Twitter|tweets]]. These "tweetations" proved to be a good indicator of highly cited articles, leading the author to propose a "Twimpact factor", which is the number of Tweets it receives in the first seven days of publication, as well as a Twindex, which is the rank percentile of an article's Twimpact factor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if implementing use of the Twimpact factor, research shows scores to be highly subject specific, and as a result, comparisons of Twimpact factors should be made between papers of the same subject area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is necessary to note that while past research in the literature has demonstrated a correlation between tweetations and citations, it is not a causative relationship. At this point in time, it is unclear whether higher citations occur as a result of greater media attention via twitter and other platforms, or is simply reflective of the quality of the article itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recent research conducted at the individual level, rather than the article level, supports the use of twitter and social media platforms as a mechanism for increasing impact value.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Xuan|date=2014|title=Building Buzz: (Scientists) Communicating Science in New Media Environments|url=|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicate that researchers whose work is mentioned on twitter have significantly higher h-indices than those of researchers whose work was not mentioned on twitter. The study highlights the role of using discussion based platforms, such as twitter, in order to increase the value of traditional impact metrics.

Besides Twitter and other streams, blogging has shown to be a powerful platform to discuss literature. Various platforms exist that keep track of which papers are being blogged about. Altmetric.com uses this information for calculating metrics, while other tools just report where discussion is happening, such as ResearchBlogging and Chemical blogspace.

=== Recommended ===
Platforms may even provide a formal way of ranking papers or recommending papers otherwise, such as [[Faculty of 1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Jennifer|last2=Fenner|first2=Martin|date=2013-04-01|title=The many faces of article-level metrics|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390409|journal=Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=27–30|doi=10.1002/bult.2013.1720390409|issn=1550-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saved ===
It is also informative to quantify the number of times a page has been saved, or bookmarked. It is thought that individuals typically choose to bookmark pages that have a high relevance to their own work, and as a result, bookmarks may be an additional indicator of impact for a specific study. Providers of such information include science specific [[social bookmarking]] services such as [[CiteULike]] and [[Mendeley]].

=== Cited ===
The cited category is a narrowed definition, different from the discussion. Besides the traditional metrics based on citations in scientific literature, such as those obtained from [[Google Scholar]], [[CrossRef]], [[PubMed Central]], and [[Scopus]], altmetrics also adopt citations in secondary knowledge sources. For example, ImpactStory counts the number of times a paper has been referenced by  Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ: which metrics are measured? |url=http://impactstory.org/faq#toc_3_7 |work=ImpactStory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plum Analytics also provides metrics for various academic publications,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69350-7_9|title=Medical Writing and Research Methodology for the Orthopaedic Surgeon|last=Papakostidis|first=Costas|last2=Giannoudis|first2=Peter V.|date=2018|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319693491|pages=71–79|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69350-7_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking to track research productivity. PLOS is also a tool that may be used to utilize information on engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Interpretation ==
While there is less consensus on the validity and consistency of altmetrics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jump |first=Paul |title=Research Intelligence - Alt-metrics: fairer, faster impact data? |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/420926.article |newspaper=Times Higher Education |date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interpretation of altmetrics in particular is discussed. Proponents of altmetrics make clear that many of the metrics show attention or engagement, rather than the quality of impacts on the progress of science.&lt;ref name="Lin2013" /&gt; It should be noted that even citation-based metrics do not indicate if a high score implies a positive impact on science; that is, papers are also cited in papers that disagree with the cited paper, an issue for example addressed by the Citation Typing Ontology project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shotton | first1 = D. | title = CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology | doi = 10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6 | journal = Journal of Biomedical Semantics | volume = 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S6–S1 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20626926| pmc =2903725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altmetrics could be more appropriately interpreted by providing detailed context and qualitative data. For example, in order to evaluate the scientific contribution of a scholar work to policy making by altmetrics, qualitative data, such as who’s citing online&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mehrazar |first=Maryam |last2=Kling |first2=Christoph Carl |last3=Lemke |first3=Steffen |last4=Mazarakis |first4=Athanasios |last5=Peters |first5=Isabella |date=2018-04-08 |title=Can We Count on Social Media Metrics? First Insights into the Active Scholarly Use of Social Media |book-title=Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science |page=215 |arxiv=1804.02751 |doi=10.1145/3201064.3201101 |doi-access=free |isbn=9781450355636}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to what extent the online citation is relevant to the policymaking, should be provided as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.altmetric.com/blog/how-to-use-altmetrics-to-showcase-engagement-efforts-for-promotion-and-tenure/|title=How to Use Altmetrics to Showcase Engagement Efforts for Promotion and Tenure|date=2016-10-18|work=Altmetric|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the relatively low correlation between traditional metrics and altmetrics, altmetrics might measure complementary perspectives of the scholar impact. It is reasonable to combine and compare the two types of metrics in interpreting the societal and scientific impacts. Researchers built a 2*2 framework based on the interactions between altmetrics and traditional citations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further explanations should be provided for the two groups with high altmetrics/low citations and low altmetrics/high citations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, altmetrics provide convenient approaches for researchers and institutions to monitor the impact of their work and avoid inappropriate interpretations.

== Controversy ==
The usefulness of metrics for estimating scientific impact is controversial.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Are Alternative Metrics Still Alternative? |author1=Mike Buschman |author2=Andrea Michalek |url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Buschman_Michalek.html  |newspaper=asis&amp;t Bulletin |date=April–May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cheung | first1 = M. K. | title = Altmetrics: Too soon for use in assessment | doi = 10.1038/494176d | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7436 | pages = 176 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23407528| pmc = | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..176C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that online buzz could amplify the effect of other forms of outreach on researchers’ scientific impact. For the nano-scientists that are mentioned on Twitter, their interactions with reporters and non-scientists positively and significantly predicted higher h-index, whereas the non-mentioned group failed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Altmetrics expands the measurement of scholar impact for containing a rapid uptake, a broader range of audiences and diverse research outputs. In addition, the community shows a clear need: funders demand measurables on the impact of their spending, such as public engagement.

However, there are limitations that affect the usefulness due to technique problems and systematic bias of construct, such as data quality, heterogeneity and particular dependencies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In terms of technique problems, the data might be incomplete, because it is difficult to collect those online research outputs without direct links to their mentions (i.e. videos) and identify different versions of one research work. Additionally, whether the API leads to any missing data is unsolved.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As for systematic bias, like other metrics, altmetrics are prone to self-citation, gaming, and other mechanisms to boost one's apparent impact. Altmetrics can be [[Gaming the system|gamed]]: for example, likes and mentions can be bought.&lt;ref name="Beall2013"&gt;J. Beall, Article-Level Metrics: An Ill-Conceived and Meretricious Idea, 2013, {{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/08/01/article-level-metrics/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806010915/http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/08/01/article-level-metrics/|archivedate=2013-08-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altmetrics can be more difficult to standardize than citations. One example is the number of tweets linking to a paper where the number can vary widely depending on how the tweets are collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=S.|year=2013|title=Consuming Article-Level Metrics: Observations and Lessons|journal=Information Standards Quarterly|volume=25|issue=2|pages=4–13|doi=10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.02|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, online popularity may not equal to scientific values. Some popular online citations might be far from the value of generating further research discoveries, while some theoretical-driven or minority-targeted research of great science-related importance might be marginalized online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the top tweeted articles in biomedicine in 2011 were relevant to curious or funny content, potential health applications, and catastrophe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Altmetrics for more recent articles may be higher because of the increasing uptake of the social web and because articles may be mentioned mainly when they are published.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Thelwall|first1=M.|last2=Haustein|first2=S.|last3=Larivière|first3=V.|last4=Sugimoto|first4=C. R.|year=2013|title=Do Altmetrics Work? Twitter and Ten Other Social Web Services|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e64841|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064841|pmc=3665624|pmid=23724101|bibcode=2013PLoSO...864841T}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it might not be fair to compare the altmetrics scores of articles unless they have been published at a similar time. Researchers has developed a sign test to avoid the usage uptake bias by comparing the metrics of an article with the two articles published immediately before and after it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It should be kept in mind that the metrics are only one of the outcomes of tracking how research is disseminated and used. Altmetrics should be carefully interpreted to overcome the bias. Even more informative than knowing how often a paper is cited, is which papers are citing it. That information allows researchers to see how their work is impacting the field (or not). Providers of metrics also typically provide access to the information from which the metrics were calculated. For example, [[Web of Science]] shows which are the citing papers, ImpactStory shows which Wikipedia pages are referencing the paper, and CitedIn shows which databases extracted data from the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Waagmeester|first1=A.|last2=Evelo|first2=C.|year=2011|title=Measuring impact in online resources with the CInumber (the CitedIn Number for online impact)|journal=Nature Precedings|doi=10.1038/npre.2011.6037.1|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of altmetrics, or any metrics, is how universities or institutions are using metrics to rank their employees make promotion or funding decisions,&lt;ref&gt;David Colquhoun, [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=182 How should universities be run to get the best out of people?], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the aim should be limited to measure engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/altmetrics-risk-becoming-part-problem-not-solution-warns-academic|title=Altmetrics risk becoming part of problem, not solution, warns academic|last1=Matthews|first1=David|date=7 October 2015|website=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall online research output is very little and varied among different disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The phenomenon might be consistent with the social media use among scientists. Surveys has shown that nearly half of their respondents held ambivalent attitudes of social media’s influence on academic impact and never announced their research work on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scimep.wisc.edu/projects/reports/|title=Reports|date=2014-09-11|work=Science, Media and the Public|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the changing shift in open science and social media use, the consistent altmetrics across disciplines and institutions will more likely be adopted.

== Ongoing research ==
The specific use cases and characteristics is an active research field in [[bibliometrics]], providing much needed data to measure the impact of altmetrics itself. Public Library of Science has an Altmetrics Collection&lt;ref name=PLosONE-AltmetricsCollection-2012&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Priem|first1=Jason|last2=Groth|first2=Paul|last3=Taraborelli|first3=Dario|editor1-last=Ouzounis|editor1-first=Christos A.|title=The Altmetrics Collection|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048753|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e48753|year=2012|pmid=23133655|pmc=3486795|bibcode=2012PLoSO...748753P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the ''Information Standards Quarterly'' and the ''Aslib Journal of Information Management'' recently published special issues on altmetrics.&lt;ref name=NISO-InfoStandardsQuarterly&gt;{{cite journal|title=Topic: Altmetrics|url=http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/|journal=Information Standards Quarterly (ISQ)|doi=10.3789/isqv25no2.2013|publisher=[[NISO]]|volume=25|number=2|date=Summer 2013|access-date=2013-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803014236/http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2|archive-date=2013-08-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aslib-2015&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Haustein|editor1-first=Stefanie|editor2-last=Sugimoto|editor2-first=Cassidy R.|editor3-last=Larivière|editor3-first=Vincent|title=Social Media Metrics in Scholarly Communication: exploring tweets, blogs, likes and other altmetrics|volume=67|number=3|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ajim/67/3|journal=Aslib Journal of Information Management|issn=2050-3806|year=2015|doi=10.1108/ajim-03-2015-0047}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of articles that extensively reviews altmetrics was published in late 2015.&lt;ref name=WebIndicators-Part1-2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thelwall|first1=Mike A.|last2=Kousha|first2=Kayvan|title=Web indicators for research evaluation, part 1: Citations and links to academic articles from the web|journal=El Profesional de la Información|year=2015|volume=24|issue=5|pages=587–606|doi=10.3145/epi.2015.sep.08|url=https://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/EPI/article/download/epi.2015.sep.08/21884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebIndicators-Part2-2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thelwall|first1=Mike A.|last2=Kousha|first2=Kayvan|title=Web indicators for research evaluation, part 2: Social media metrics|journal=El Profesional de la Información|year=2015|volume=24|issue=5|pages=607–620|doi=10.3145/epi.2015.sep.09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebIndicators-Part3-2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kousha|first1=Kayvan|last2=Thelwall|first2=Mike A.|title=Web indicators for research evaluation, part 3: Books and non-standard outputs|journal=El Profesional de la Información|year=2015|volume=24|issue=6|pages=724–736|doi=10.3145/epi.2015.nov.04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is other research examining the validity of one altmetrics&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or make comparisons across different platforms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Researchers examine the correlation between altmetrics and traditional citations as the validity test. They assume that the positive and significant correlation reveals the accuracy of altmetrics to measure scientific impact as citations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The low correlation (less than 0.30&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) leads to the conclusion that altmetrics serves a complementary role in scholar impact measurement. However, it remains unsolved that what altmetrics are most valuable and what degree of correlation between two metrics generates a stronger impact on the measurement. Additionally, the validity test itself faces some technical problems as well. For example, replication of the data collection is impossible because of the instant changing algorithms of data providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jean|last2=Adie|first2=Euan|date=2013-04-01|title=Five challenges in altmetrics: A toolmaker's perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410|journal=Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410|issn=1550-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''Aramaic studies''' is the study of the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac Christianity]]. A specialist in Aramaic studies is known as a '''Aramaicist'''. British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by the designation Syriacist (a scholar of [[Syriac studies]], at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

Aramaic studies is the term used at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Leiden]], and [[University of Detroit Mercy]]. At some other universities, Aramaic studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], as [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. Aramaic studies (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.

Aramaic academic journals include the annual ''Aramaic Studies'', a leading journal for Aramaic language and literature published by Brill Academic Publishers. The journal incorporates the previous ''Journal for the Aramaic Bible'' for a more inclusive scope, to include all aspects of Aramaic language and literature, even when not, or only indirectly, related to Biblical texts.

'''Audience segmentation''' is a process of dividing people into homogeneous [[subgroup]]s based upon defined criterion such as [[product usage]], [[demographics]], [[psychographics]], [[communication behavior]]s and [[media use]].&lt;ref&gt;Cirksena, M.K., &amp; Flora, J.A. (1995). Audience segmentation in worksite health promotion: A procedure using social marketing concepts. Health Education Research, 10, 211–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J.E., &amp; Flora, J.A. (1995). Health behavior segmentation and campaign planning to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among Hispanics. Health Education Quarterly, 22, 36–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation is used in [[commercial marketing]] so [[advertiser]]s can design and tailor products and services that satisfy the targeted groups. In [[social marketing]], audiences are segmented into subgroups and assumed to have similar interests, needs and behavioral patterns and this assumption allows social marketers to design relevant health or social messages that influence the people to adopt recommended behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R.N. &amp; Adkins, A.D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 498–499). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation is widely accepted as a fundamental strategy in [[communication]] campaigns to influence [[health]] and [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Audience segmentation makes campaign efforts more effective when messages are tailored to the distinct subgroups and more efficient when the [[target audience]] is selected based on their [[wikt:susceptibility|susceptibility]] and [[wikt:receptivity|receptivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkin, C. &amp; Freimuth, V. (2001). Formative evaluation research in campaign design. In R.E. Rice &amp; C.K. Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 125–145). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dervin, B. &amp; Frenette, M. (2001). Applying sense-making methodology: Communicating communicatively with audiences as listeners, learners, teachers, confidantes. In R.E. Rice &amp; C.K. Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 69–87). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for audience segmentation strategy==
Audience segmentation strategy is driven by the goal of developing criteria that can be used to form [[homogeneous]] clusters. The most common criteria used are demographics (age, level of [[education]], [[income]], [[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]) and geography (region, county, [[census tract]]). Since an audience segment that is derived exclusively from demographics such as [[Asian-American]] youths constitutes a large group that still has varied beliefs, values and behavior, demographics may not be sufficient as segmentation criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267–283.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated segmentation strategies use [[psychosocial]], behavioral and psychographics (personality, values, attitudes, interests, level of readiness for change and lifestyles) as variables to categorize audience subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A. (1994). Market segmentation: Using demographics, psychographics and other niche marketing techniques to predict and model customer behavior. Chicago, IL: Probus.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the audience has been divided into segments based on selected criteria, campaigns are then designed and communication channels are selected to reach their intended audience effectively.

Grunig's model of segmentation
Grunig proposed a [[Theory|theory-based model]] of segmentation which comprises a series of inner and outer nests.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, J.E. (1989). Publics, audiences, and market segments: Segmentation principles for campaigns. In C.T. Salmon (Ed.) Information campaigns: Balancing social values and social change (pp. 199–228). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner nests contain (a) individuals (individual communication behaviors and effects) and (b) publics (groups of people sharing common interests and issues). The outer nests consist of (c) communities, (d) psychographics, lifestyles and subcultures, and [[social relationship]]s, (e) [[geodemographics]], (f) demographics/social categories and (g) mass audience. The nests display increasing specificity instead of generality as they move towards the inner center; more specificity provides more audience details and insights that allow communication campaigns to create more precise messages for the target audience.

==Ethical issues==
Audience segmentation is employed in [[health intervention]]s as a strategy to effectively utilize limited resources to reach the intended population. [[Health equity|Equity]] and [[utility]] are often the prominent ethical issues in audience segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, N. (1997). Ethical dilemmas in health communication interventions. Health Communication, 9, 155–190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J.G., (1996). The cost effectiveness of HIV prevention targeting: How much more bang for the buck? American Journal of Public Health, 86, 1709–1712.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, M.L. (2001). Ethical considerations in the use of marketing for the management of public health and social issues. In A.R. Andreasen (Ed.), Ethics in social marketing (pp. 36–69). Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some campaigns target people who are most inclined to accept suggested messages while other campaigns aim at those with highest risk, despite the fact that they are hard to reach or least likely to adopt recommended behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Des Jarlais, D.C., Padian, N.S., &amp; Winkelstein, W. (1994). Targeted HIV-prevention programs. New England Journal of Medicine, 331, 1451–1453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freimuth, V.S., &amp; Mettger, W. (1990). Is there a hard-to-reach audience? Public Health Reports, 105, 232–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical [[dilemma]] occurs when [[health communicator]]s have to identify audience segments and plan health interventions for these groups, depriving those not targeted in the process. 

[[Public health]] campaigns often target large segments of population who have low to moderate risk as small changes can create visible impact on [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. (1985). Sick individuals and sick populations. International Journal of Epidemiology, 14, 32–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Health campaigns aim to decrease [[alcoholic beverage]] consumption focus on moderate users who are larger in number and have higher likelihood to respond positively to the interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, N. (2003). Ethics in health communication interventions. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 657–658). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, targeting small segments of the high risk population (e.g. heavy smokers) in quit [[smoking]] campaigns may be inefficient as they are less likely to stop the risky behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, E.B. (1995). Editorial: The results of the COMMIT Trial. American Journal of Public Health, 83, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience segmentation can also cause conflicts within the community. The [[Nigeria]] STD/HIV Management Project, funded by the UK [[Department of International Development]] (DFID) in 1999 stirred intense conflicts after non-targeted community members felt resources had been unfairly allocated to the "unworthy" audience segment, people living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. As a result, HIV-infected victims were turned away from attending [[health center]]s, excluded and discriminated by the community and 25 people with HIV/AIDS in the project eventually died by the end of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, J. &amp; Caffrey, M.

Slater and Flora's 1991 study on the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] among central [[California]]ns utilized health behaviors to segment the audience into seven subgroups.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The health behaviors criteria included (a) cognitive (health knowledge, attitudes, [[issue involvement]], perceived response efficacy, perceived risk, and perceived [[self-efficacy]]); (b) social influence (community, [[reference group]] and family norms, expectations from family and friends, and social visibility of behavior); and (c) individual norms obtained from personal history. The study yielded two distinctive subgroups, despite their demographic similarities (White and middle [[socioeconomic status]]). The group with moderate level of good diets and physical activity and low [[tobacco]] consumption was more likely to seek health information and believed that cardiovascular disease was preventable by changing their health behavior. On the other hand, the group with poor diets, high level of [[alcohol]] and tobacco consumption and high perception of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease did not plan to mitigate those risks and refrained from seeking health information.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparities between these two segments were crucial for health communicators to design and tailor different messages to influence their [[health behavior]]s.

Rimal, Brown, Mkandawire, Folda, Bose and Creel identified risk perceptions and [[efficacy]] beliefs as the main audience segmentation criteria for the HIV-prevention project in [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R.N., Brown, J., Mkandawire, G., Folda, L., Bose, K. &amp; Creel, A.H. (2009). Audience segmentation as a social-marketing tool in health promotion: Use of the risk perception attitude framework in HIV Prevention in Malawi. American Journal of Public Health, 99 (12), 2224–2229.&lt;/ref&gt; Four subgroups created were responsive (high risk, high efficacy), avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy) and indifference (low risk, low efficacy). The study found different levels of HIV knowledge, [[HIV testing]] and [[condom]] use among the four segments. Responsive and proactive groups were most responsive to preventive behaviors whereas avoidance and indifference groups were less inclined to practice preventive behaviors. Audience segmentation could be utilized in Malawi to target different segments with tailored messages in [[risk perception]]s and efficacy beliefs in order to influence them to adopt recommended HIV prevention behaviors.

==Overview&lt;!--'Bekenstein–Hawking formula' and 'Bekenstein-Hawking formula' redirect here--&gt;==

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that [[black holes]] have [[entropy]]. If black holes carried no entropy, it would be possible to violate the second law by throwing mass into the black hole. The increase of the entropy of the black hole more than compensates for the decrease of the entropy carried by the object that was swallowed.

Starting from theorems proved by [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Jacob Bekenstein]] conjectured that the black hole entropy was proportional to the area of its [[event horizon]] divided by the Planck area. In 1973 Bekenstein suggested &lt;math&gt;(1/2\cdot\ln{2})/4\pi&lt;/math&gt; as the constant of proportionality, asserting that if the constant was not exactly this, it must be very close to it. The next year, in 1974, Hawking showed that black holes emit thermal [[Hawking radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25805/ "First Observation of Hawking Radiation"] from the ''[[Technology Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matson, John|title=Artificial event horizon emits laboratory analogue to theoretical black hole radiation|journal=Sci.

:&lt;math&gt;S_\text{BH} = \frac{kA}{4\ell_\text{P}^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the event horizon, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\ell_\text{P} = \sqrt{G\hbar / c^3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck length]]. This is often referred to as the '''Bekenstein–Hawking formula'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The subscript BH either stands for "black hole" or "Bekenstein–Hawking". The black-hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that the black-hole entropy is also the maximal entropy that can be obtained by the [[Bekenstein bound]] (wherein the Bekenstein bound becomes an equality) was the main observation that led to the [[holographic principle]].&lt;ref name="Bousso 2002 825–874"/&gt;

Although Hawking's calculations gave further thermodynamic evidence for black-hole entropy, until 1995 no one was able to make a controlled calculation of black-hole entropy based on [[statistical mechanics]], which associates entropy with a large number of microstates.  In fact, so called "[[no-hair theorem|no-hair]]" theorems&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=gr-qc/0702006 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99t1101B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.201101 |pmid=18233129 | title=Black-Hole No-Hair Theorems for a Positive Cosmological Constant |journal=Physical Review Letters |year=2007 |volume=99 |issue=20 |pages=201101 |first=Sourav |last=Bhattacharya}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to suggest that black holes could have only a single microstate.

Their calculation was followed by many similar computations of entropy of large classes of other [[extremal black hole|extremal]] and [[near-extremal black hole]]s, and the result always agreed with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula. However, for the [[Schwarzschild black hole]], viewed as the most far-from-extremal black hole, the relationship between micro- and macrostates is expected to be clarified from the string-theoretical viewpoint. Various studies are in progress, but this has not yet been elucidated.

In [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG)&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of loop quantum gravity researchers]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to associate a geometrical interpretation to the microstates: these are the quantum geometries of the horizon. LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon.&lt;ref name="Rovelli1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rovelli |first=Carlo |year=1996 |title=Black Hole Entropy from Loop Quantum Gravity|journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=77 |issue= 16|pages=3288–3291 |id= |doi=  10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3288|pmid=10062183 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=gr-qc/9603063 |bibcode=  1996PhRvL..77.3288R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashtekar1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashtekar |first=Abhay |authorlink= |author2=Baez, John |author3=Corichi, Alejandro |author4= Krasnov, Kirill  |year=1998 |title=Quantum Geometry and Black Hole Entropy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=904–907 |id= |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.904 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=gr-qc/9710007 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..80..904A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to derive, from the covariant formulation of full quantum theory ([[spinfoam]]) the correct relation between energy and area (1st law), the [[Unruh temperature]] and the distribution that yields Hawking entropy.&lt;ref name="Bianchi2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Bianchi |first=Eugenio |year=2012 |title=Entropy of Non-Extremal Black Holes from Loop Gravity |eprint=1204.5122 |class=gr-qc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation makes use of the notion of [[dynamical horizon]] and is done for non-extremal black holes. There seems to be also discussed the calculation of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy from the point of view of LQG.

== The laws of black hole mechanics ==

The four '''laws of black hole mechanics''' are physical properties that [[black hole]]s are believed to satisfy. The laws, analogous to the laws of [[thermodynamics]], were discovered by [[Brandon Carter]], [[Stephen Hawking]], and [[James M. Bardeen|James Bardeen]].

===Statement of the laws===

The laws of black-hole mechanics are expressed in [[geometrized units]]

===The zeroth law===

The horizon has constant [[surface gravity]] for a stationary black hole.

===&lt;span id="The First Law"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The first law===

For perturbations of stationary black holes, the change of energy is related to change of area, angular momentum, and electric charge by

:&lt;math&gt;dE = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi}\,dA + \Omega\,dJ + \Phi\,dQ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy]], &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface gravity]], &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the horizon area, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]], &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electric potential energy|electrostatic potential]] and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric charge]].

===&lt;span id="The Second Law"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The second law ===

The horizon area is, assuming the [[energy conditions#Mathematical statement|weak energy condition]], a non-decreasing function of time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt} \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This "law" was superseded by Hawking's discovery that black holes radiate, which causes both the black hole's mass and the area of its horizon to decrease over time.

=== The third law ===

It is not possible to form a black hole with vanishing surface gravity. &lt;math&gt;\kappa = 0&lt;/math&gt; is not possible to achieve.

=== Discussion of the laws ===

==== The zeroth law ====

The zeroth law is analogous to the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]], which states that the temperature is constant throughout a body in [[thermal equilibrium]].  It suggests that the surface gravity is analogous to [[temperature]]. ''T'' constant for thermal equilibrium for a normal system is analogous to &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; constant over the horizon of a stationary black hole.

==== The first law ====

The left side, ''dE'', is the change in energy (proportional to mass).  Although the first term does not have an immediately obvious physical interpretation, the second and third terms on the right side represent changes in energy due to rotation and [[electromagnetism]]. Analogously, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] is a statement of [[conservation of energy|energy conservation]], which contains on its right side the term ''T dS''.

==== The second law ====

The second law is the statement of Hawking's area theorem.  Analogously, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the change in [[entropy]] in an isolated system will be greater than or equal to 0 for a spontaneous process, suggesting a link between entropy and the area of a black-hole horizon. However, this version violates the second law of thermodynamics by matter losing (its) entropy as it falls in, giving a decrease in entropy. However, generalizing the second law as the sum of black-hole entropy and outside entropy, shows that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated in a system including the universe beyond the horizon.

The generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) was needed to present the second law of thermodynamics as valid. This is because the second law of thermodynamics, as a result of the disappearance of [[entropy]] near the exterior of black holes, is not useful. The GSL allows for the application of the law because now the measurement of interior, common entropy is possible. The validity of the GSL can be established by studying an example, such as looking at a system having entropy that falls into a bigger, non-moving black hole, and establishing upper and lower entropy bounds for the increase in the black hole entropy and entropy of the system, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bekenstein|first=Jacob D.|date=1974-06-15|title=Generalized second law of thermodynamics in black-hole physics|url=https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.9.3292|journal=Physical Review D|volume=9|issue=12|pages=3292–3300|doi=10.1103/physrevd.9.3292|issn=0556-2821}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should also note that the GSL will hold for theories of gravity such as [[Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell|Einstein gravity]], [[Lovelock theory of gravity|Lovelock gravity]], or Braneworld gravity, because the conditions to use GSL for these can be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu, Wang, Yang, Zhang|first=Shao-Feng,Bin,Guo-Hang,Peng-Ming|date=17 November 2008|title=The generalized second law of thermodynamics in generalized gravity theories|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/25/23/235018/meta|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=25|via=iopscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the topic of black hole formation, the question becomes whether or not the generalized second law of thermodynamics will be valid, and if it is, it will have been proved valid for all situations. Because a black hole formation is not stationary, but instead moving, proving that the GSL holds is difficult. Proving the GSL is generally valid would require using [[Quantum statistical mechanics|quantum-statistical mechanics]], because the GSL is both a [[Quantum laws|quantum]] and [[Empirical statistical laws|statistical law]]. This discipline does not exist so the GSL can be assumed to be useful in general, as well as for prediction. For example, one can use the GSL to predict that, for a cold, non-rotating assembly of ''N'' nucleons, S&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt; – S &gt; 0, where ''S&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the entropy of a black hole and ''S'' is the sum of the ordinary entropy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wald|first=Robert M.|date=2001|title=The Thermodynamics of Black Holes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5253844/|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.12942/lrr-2001-6|issn=1433-8351|pmc=5253844|pmid=28163633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The third law ====

[[Extremal black hole]]s&lt;ref name=" High Energy Physics - Theory"&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=hep-th/9205027 |bibcode=1992PhRvD..46.5278K |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.46.5278 | title=Supersymmetry as a cosmic censor |journal=Physical Review D |year=1992 |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=5278–5302 |first=Renata |last=Kallosh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have vanishing surface gravity. Stating that &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; cannot go to zero is analogous to the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that the entropy of a system at absolute zero is a well defined constant. This is because a system at zero temperature exists in its ground state. Furthermore, Δ''S'' will reach zero at zero temperature, but ''S'' itself will also reach zero, at least for perfect crystalline substances. No experimentally verified violations of the laws of thermodynamics are known.

=== Interpretation of the laws ===

The four laws of black-hole mechanics suggest that one should identify the surface gravity of a black hole with temperature and the area of the event horizon with entropy, at least up to some multiplicative constants.  If one only considers black holes classically, then they have zero temperature and, by the [[no-hair theorem]],&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt; zero entropy, and the laws of black-hole mechanics remain an analogy.  However, when [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical effects]] are taken into account, one finds that black holes emit [[thermal radiation]] ([[Hawking radiation]]) at a temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{H} = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the first law of black-hole mechanics, this determines the multiplicative constant of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy, which is

:&lt;math&gt;S_\text{BH} = \frac{A}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Beyond black holes==

[[Gary Gibbons]] and Hawking have shown that black-hole thermodynamics is more general than black holes—that [[Particle horizon|cosmological event horizons]] also have an entropy and temperature.

More fundamentally, [[Gerardus 't Hooft|'t Hooft]] and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]] used the laws of black-hole thermodynamics to argue for a general [[holographic principle]] of nature, which asserts that consistent theories of gravity and quantum mechanics must be lower-dimensional.  Though not yet fully understood in general, the holographic principle is central to theories like the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].&lt;ref&gt;For an authoritative review, see {{cite journal |author1=Ofer Aharony |author2=Steven S.

There are also connections between black-hole entropy and fluid [[surface tension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.53.3738| title = Surface tension, hydrophobicity, and black holes: The entropic connection| journal = Physical Review E| volume = 53| issue = 4| pages = 3738–3744| year = 1996| last1 = Callaway | first1 = D. | pmid=9964684|arxiv = cond-mat/9601111 |bibcode = 1996PhRvE..53.3738C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''brocard''' is a [[legal maxim]] in [[Latin]] that is, in a strict sense, derived from traditional legal authorities, even from [[ancient Rome]]. The word is a variant of the [[Latinized name]] of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died AD 1025), Bishop of [[Worms, Germany]], who compiled 20 volumes of ''Ecclesiastical Rules''.

==History==
Begun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the ''Collectarium Canonum'' or ''Decretum'', became the primary source for [[canon law]].

Along with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the [[Old Testament]] and [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], Burchard included the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal "Council of Anquira" in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of [[canon law]], Burchard's ''Decretum'' was supplanted around 1150 by the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of [[canon law]].

Burchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating ''Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis'', a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated.

Although the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] first came to [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Julius Caesar#Conquest of Gaul|55 BC]], [[Roman Law]] has had negligible influence&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfsr.com/pdf/influences-of-roman-law-and-civil-law-on-the-common-law&lt;/ref&gt; on [[English common law]]. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Medieval era]]. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'', ''[[novus actus interveniens]]'', ''[[talem qualem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195557558.001.0001/acref-9780195557558-e-3249?rskey=0DnFO4&amp;result=3248&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[de minimis non curat lex]]'', and  ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', the common law is not premised on the principles of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' previously included numerous brocards among its entries.

==Examples==
;''Contra non valentem agere nulla'' [or ''non''] ''currit praescriptio'' : A [[statute of limitation]] does not run against those who cannot act; this is the basis of the American discovery rule limiting prescriptive limitation periods.
;''[[Dura lex, sed lex]]'' : "The [[law]] [is] harsh, but [it is] the law". It follows from the principle of the [[rule of law]] that even [[Draco (lawgiver)|draconian]] laws must be followed and enforced; if one disagrees with the result, one must seek to change the law.
;''[[Ignorantia juris non excusat|Ignorantia legis non excusat]]'' : "Ignorance of the law is no excuse."  Not knowing that one's actions are forbidden by the law is not a defense.
;''In claris non fit interpretatio'' : When a rule is clearly intelligible, there is no need of proposing a (usually extensive) interpretation.
;''Inadimplenti non est adimplendum'' : "One has no need to respect his obligation if the counter-party has not respected his own." This is used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) referred to as the [[synallagmatic contract]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jusbelli.com/Bouvier/bouvier1856_sw.html&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''[[Lex specialis derogat legi generali]]'' : "A law governing a specific subject matter overrides a law which only governs general matters." 
; ''[[Iura novit curia]]'' : The judge knows the law (technically, there is no need to "explain the law" or the legal system to a judge/justice in any given petition).
; ''[[Nemo dat quod non habet]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100228794&lt;/ref&gt; The basic rule that a person who does not own property (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true owner's authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of [[estoppel]] prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell.
; ''[[Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'' : There can be neither [[crime]] nor [[punishment]] unless there is a [[penal law]] first.
;''[[Pacta sunt servanda]]'' : Contracts are the law ''or'' Contracts establish obligations (between those who sign them).
; ''Quod non est in registro, non est in Mundo'' : What is not reported in the (related, referring) registry, has no legal relevance. Used when a formal act (usually a recording or a transcription) is required in order to give consistence, content or efficacy to a [[right]].
; ''Res inter alios acta vel iudicata, aliis nec nocet nec prodocet'' : What has been agreed/decided between people (a specific group) can neither benefit nor harm a third party (meaning: two or more people cannot agree amongst each other to establish an obligation for a third party who was not involved in the negotiation; furthermore, any benefit that may be established will have to be accepted by the third party before it can be implemented).
; ''Sententia quae in rem iudicatam transit, pro veritate habetur'' : When a definitive [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] is declared, it is considered to be the truth. In the case of a sentence ''in rem iudicatam'' (that finally consents to consider a judgement completed), its content will then be the only legally relevant consideration of a fact.
; ''Solve et repete'' : Respect your obligation first, then you can ask for reimbursement. Used in those situations in which one of the two (or more) parties needs to complete his obligation before being allowed to ask for the opposite obligation to be respected by his counter party. Usually this principle is used in fields and subjects in which a certain general steadiness or uniformity of the system has been considered a relevant value by the legislator. The case is typical of service contracts with repeated obligations (like with gas, water, electricity providers and similars), in which irregularities on one side cannot be balanced if not in a regular situation (i.e., of payments) on the other side. The customer, for example, might be asked to pay regularly the new bill, before contesting the previous one in which he found irregular calculations, and asking for a balancement with newer bills; he thus cannot by himself determine a discount in the next payment.
; ''Ubi lex voluit, dixit; ubi noluit, tacuit'' : When the law wanted to regulate the matter in further detail, it did regulate the matter; when it did not want to regulate the matter in further detail, it remained silent (in the interpretation of a law, an excessively expansive interpretation might perhaps go beyond the intention of the [[legislator]], thus we must adhere to what is in the text of the law and draw no material consequences from the law's silence).

The main bodies were hewn directly from the [[sandstone]] cliffs, but details were modeled in mud mixed with straw, coated with [[stucco]].

The lower parts of the statues' arms were constructed from the same mud-straw mix supported on wooden armatures. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. The rows of holes that can be seen in photographs held wooden pegs that stabilized the outer stucco.

Bamiyan lies on the [[Silk Road]], which runs through the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain region, in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world. It was the site of several [[Buddhist monasteries]], and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as [[hermit]]s in small caves carved into the side of the Bamiyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored [[fresco]]es. It was a Buddhist religious site from the 2nd century up to the time of the [[Islam]]ic invasion in the later half of the 7th century. Until it was completely conquered by the [[Muslim]] [[Saffarids]] in the 9th century, Bamiyan shared the culture of [[Gandhara]].

[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|right|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]

The two most prominent statues were the giant standing sculptures of Buddhas [[Vairocana]] and [[Sakyamuni]], identified by the different [[mudras]] performed. The Buddha popularly called "Solsol" measured 53 meters tall, and "Shahmama" 35 meters—the niches in which the figures stood are 58 and 38 meters respectively from bottom to top.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Research of state and stability of the rock niches of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in [http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha "Completed Research Results of Military University of Munich"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032715/http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216070456/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 December 2013 |title=Computer Reconstruction and Modeling of the Great Buddha Statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being blown up in 2001 they were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world (the 8th century [[Leshan Giant Buddha]] is taller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/779 |title=Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that statue is sitting). Since then the [[Statue of unity]] has been built in India, and at {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} it is the [[tallest statue]] in the world, breaking the record earlier held by The [[Spring Temple Buddha]]  {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Fodushan Scenic Area, Lushan County, Henan, China. Plans for the construction of the Spring Temple Buddha were announced soon after the blowing up of the Bamiyan Buddhas and China condemned the systematic destruction of the Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan.

[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Smaller Buddha in 1977]]

It is believed that the monumental Buddha sculptures were carved into the cliffs of Bamiyan between the 3rd to 6th centuries AD, while the cave complex in the east, including the 38 meter Buddha, a stupa was built in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD. The 55 meter Buddha is believed to date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Historic documentation refers to celebrations held every year attracting numerous pilgrims and that offers were made to the monumental statues (http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/208rev.pdf). They were perhaps the most famous cultural landmarks of the region, and the site was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the surrounding cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley. Their color faded through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110225122816.htm |title=Bamiyan Buddhas Once Glowed in Red, White and Blue |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited the site on 30 April 630 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Yamada, Meiji (2002). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100707012445/http://www.shin-ibs.edu/documents/pwj3-4/07YM4.pdf Buddhism of Bamiyan], Pacific World, 3rd series 4, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhist Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laputanlogic.com/articles/2003/09/21-106424100165818095.html |title=Xuan Zang and the Third Buddha |publisher=Laputanlogic.com |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127095257/http://www.laputanlogic.com/articles/2003/09/21-106424100165818095.html |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and described Bamiyan in the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions|Da Tang Xiyu Ji]]'' as a flourishing Buddhist center "with more than ten monasteries and more than a thousand monks". He also noted that both Buddha figures were "decorated with gold and fine jewels" (Wriggins, 1995). Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="gall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"/&gt; A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamiyan, still exists in the [[Bingling Temple]] caves in China's [[Gansu]] province.

The destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas became a symbol of oppression and a rallying point for the freedom of religious expression. Despite the fact that most Afghans are now Muslim, they too had embraced their past and many were appalled by the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hazaristantimes.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/bamyan-series/ |title=Buddhas of Bamiyan |publisher=Hazaristantimes.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIM MCGIRK/Bamiyan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238674,00.html |title=What Lies Beneath |publisher=Time.com |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Buddha's statue===

====11th to the 20th century====
In 1221, with the advent of [[Genghis Khan]], "a terrible disaster befell Bamiyan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhism Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |title=Remembering Bamiyan |publisher=Kashgar.com.au |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004201837/http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the statues were spared. Later, the Mughal emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king [[Nader Shah|Nader Afshar]], directing cannon fire at them.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian Art'', chap. "History of attacks on the Buddhas"&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous statues, the male Salsal ("light shines through the universe") and the (smaller) female Shamama ("Queen Mother"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-frei.info/dvd/christian_frei-booklet_en.pdf |title=booklet web E.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were called by the locals, did not fail to fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.&lt;ref&gt;Laban Kaptein, ''Eindtijd en Antichrist'', p. 127. Leiden 1997. {{ISBN|90-73782-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997 to 2001, under the Taliban====
Abdul Wahed, a Taliban commander operating around the area, announced his intention to blow up the Buddhas in 1997, even before he had taken control of the valley. In 1998 when he battled off the [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]] militia from the area and took control of Bamiyan, Wahed drilled holes in the Buddhas' heads for explosives. He was prevented from taking further action by the local governor and a direct order of [[Mohammed Omar]], although tires were later burned on the head of the great Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 ''Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed''], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, Mullah Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, and the statues were no longer worshipped, he added: "The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Harding| first = Luke| date = 3 March 2001| title = How the Buddha got his wounds| publisher = The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/books.guardianreview2| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228113747/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4145138%2C00.html| archivedate = 28 February 2006| accessdate = 23 March 2008| location = London| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Afghanistan's radical clerics began a campaign to crack down on "un-Islamic" segments of Afghan society. The Taliban soon banned all forms of imagery, music, and sports, including television, in accordance with what they considered a strict interpretation of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Destruction of Statues Displayed in an Islamic State| publisher = Ask-Imam.com| first = Moulana Imraan| last= Vawda |url = http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=3436| accessdate = 6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree issued by him. The Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:
{{quote|I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohammad Shehzad |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/12inter.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/Mullah Omar|date=3 March 2001|work=The Rediff|accessdate=27 October 2010 | location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told [[Associated Press]] of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. "They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam," said Jamal.

According to UNESCO Director-General [[Koïchiro Matsuura]], a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 March 2001| title = World appeals to Taliban to stop destroying statues| publisher = CNN| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155700/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as "savage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2001 |first=Barry |last=Bearak |title=Over World Protests, Taliban Are Destroying Ancient Buddhas |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302192951/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |archivedate=2 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[India]] never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, [[New Delhi]] offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, "where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind".

Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, "This work of destruction is not as simple as people might think. You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |title=Photos document destruction of Afghan Buddhas |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313235406/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2104119/entry/2104187|title=Destruction and Rebuilding of the Bamyan Buddhas |publisher=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;Bergen, Peter.

On 6 March 2001, ''[[The Times]]'' quoted Mullah Mohammed Omar as stating, "Muslims should be proud of smashing idols.

On 18 March 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a Taliban envoy said the Islamic government made its decision in a rage after a foreign delegation offered money to preserve the ancient works. The report also added, however, that other reports "have said the religious leaders were debating the move for months, and ultimately decided that the statues were idolatrous and should be obliterated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crossette| first = Barbara|date=19 March 2001| title = Taliban Explains Buddha Demolition| publisher = The New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090503215139/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070|archivedate=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Taliban [[ambassador-at-large]] [[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]] said that the destruction of the statues was carried out by the Head Council of Scholars after a Swedish monuments expert proposed to restore the statues' heads. Hashimi is reported as saying: "When the Afghan head council asked them to provide the money to feed the children instead of fixing the statues, they refused and said, 'No, the money is just for the statues, not for the children'. Herein, they made the decision to destroy the statues"; however, he did not comment on the claim that a foreign museum offered to "buy the Buddhist statues, the money from which could have been used to feed children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassaimah |first=Sahar |date=12 January 2001 |title=Afghani Ambassador Speaks At USC |publisher=[[IslamOnline]] |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008012138/http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas despite protests from the international community has been described by Michael Falser, a heritage expert at the Center for Transcultural Studies in Germany, as an attack by the Taliban against the globalising concept of "cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael.

Firenze 2011: 157-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Koichiro Matsuura called the destruction a "...crime against culture. It is abominable to witness the cold and calculated destruction of cultural properties which were the heritage of the Afghan people, and, indeed, of the whole of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81406&amp;page=1#.UA4FSrQe5TI U.N.

==Commitment to rebuild==
{{BuddhasHolySites}}

Though the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognizable within the recesses. It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them. As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] and several other organizations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland, along with the [[ETH]] in [[Zurich]]—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by [[anastylosis]], the two larger Buddhas.

===Developments since 2002===
In April 2002, Afghanistan's post-Taliban leader [[Hamid Karzai]] called the destruction a "national tragedy" and pledged the Buddhas to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/04/09/gen.karzai.bamiyan/index.html|title=CNN.com - Karzai pledges to rebuild Afghan Buddhas - April  9, 2002|first=Staff and|last=wires|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Mawlawi Mohammed Islam Mohammadi]], Taliban governor of Bamiyan province at the time of the destruction and widely seen as responsible for its occurrence, was elected to the Afghan Parliament. He blamed the decision to destroy the Buddhas on [[Al-Qaeda]]'s influence on the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;''Focus on Terrorism, Volume 8'' by Edward V. Linden&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, he was assassinated in Kabul.

Swiss filmmaker [[Christian Frei]] made a 95-minute documentary titled ''[[The Giant Buddhas]]'' (released in March 2006) on the statues, the international reactions to their destruction, and an overview of the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates that [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 March 2006 |title=Laden ordered Bamyan Buddha destruction |work=[[The Times of India]] |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154952/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas and its impact on the global Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rajesh-talwar/afghan-winter/|title=AN AFGHAN WINTER by Rajesh Talwar - Kirkus Reviews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, international funding has supported recovery and stabilization efforts at the site. Fragments of the statues are documented and stored with special attention given to securing the structure of the statue still in place. It is hoped that, in the future, partial [[anastylosis]] can be conducted with the remaining fragments. In 2009, [[ICOMOS]] constructed scaffolding within the niche to further conservation and stabilization. Nonetheless, several serious conservation and safety issues exist and the Buddhas are still listed as [[World Heritage in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;Petzet, Michael (2010). "Safeguarding the Buddhas of Bamiyan". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), {{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/world_report/2008-2010/H@R_2008-2010_final.pdf |title=Heritage at Risk: ICOMOS World Report 2008-2010 on Monuments and Sites in Danger}}. Berlin: hendrik Bäßler verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006, Afghan officials were deciding on the timetable for the re-construction of the statues. As they wait for the Afghan government and international community to decide when to rebuild them, a $1.3 million UNESCO-funded project is sorting out the chunks of clay and plaster—ranging from boulders weighing several tons to fragments the size of tennis balls—and sheltering them from the elements.

The Buddhist remnants at Bamiyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]].

In 2013, the foot section of the smaller Buddha was rebuilt with iron rods, bricks and concrete by the German branch of ICOMOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martini |first1=Alessandro |last2=Rivetti |first2=Ermanno |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Organisation says actions of German archaeologists who have partially rebuilt one of the statues "border on the criminal" |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com:80/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115033225/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |archive-date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=2017-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further constructions were halted by order of UNESCO, on the grounds that the work was conducted without the organization's knowledge or approval.

==Discoveries==
[[File:BAMIYAN BUDDHAS - GROTTO PAINTINGS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grotto painting in 2008]]
After the destruction of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/200569,scientists-discover-first-ever-oil-paintings-in-afghanistan.html|title=Scientitsts discover first-ever oil paintings in Afghanistan|publisher=Earthtimes.org|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated the wall paintings at Bamiyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing their analysis of radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road, the trade route between [[China]] and the West.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Tokyo Research Institute for Cultural Properties]] in Japan, the [[Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums]] in France, the Getty Conservation Institute in the United States, and the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) in [[Grenoble]], France, analysed samples from the paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422083309.htm|title=Ancient Buddhist Paintings From Bamyan Were Made Of Oil, Hundreds Of Years Before Technique Was 'Invented' In Europe|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; They discovered that the paint contained [[pigment]]s such as vermilion (red [[mercury sulfide]]) and lead white ([[lead carbonate]]). These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg),&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt; Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of [[oil painting]], possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/04/22/sciart122.xml |title=Oil painting invented in Asia, not Europe |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=24 April 2008 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=22 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423165040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F04%2F22%2Fsciart122.xml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans.

Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition,&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080422/full/news.2008.770.html|title=Ancient Buddhas painted in oils|publisher=nature.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dispelled by [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]] giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Scientists also found the translation of the beginning section of the original [[Sanskrit]] [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] Sutra translated by [[Xuanzang]] that spelled out the basic belief of Buddhism and said all things are transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=37,3417,0,0,1,0 |title=Secret sutra found in rubble of Bamiyan Buddha |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=12 November 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in [[Paris]].

[[AOL|AOL News]], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site.

It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Harison, Emma (16 May 2012)[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/stone-carvers-taliban-bamiyan ''Stone carvers defy Taliban to return to the Bamiyan valley''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS).

The work has come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the fanaticism of the Taliban, while [[NPR]] reported that others believe the money could be better spent on housing and electricity for the region.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakissis|first=Joanna|title=Bit By Bit, Afghanistan Rebuilds Buddhist Statues|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/137304363/bit-by-bit-afghanistan-rebuilds-buddhist-statues?ft=1&amp;f=1004|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

===Rise of Buddhas with 3D light projection===
After fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Xinyu Zhang and Hong Liang filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] [[laser light]] projection technology. The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Xinyu and Hong, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues. With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from [[UNESCO]] and the [[Afghan government]] to do the project. About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the [[holographic]] statues on Sunday, 7 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mary-Ann Russon|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/buddha-statues-destroyed-by-taliban-resurrected-laser-projections-1505794 |title= Afghanistan: Buddhas of Bamiyan resurrected as laser projections | publisher=International Business Times |date= 12 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= PAULA MEJIA|url=http://www.newsweek.com/afghanistan-buddha-statues-destroyed-taliban-reimagined-holograms-343113 |title= Afghanistan Buddha Statues Destroyed by Taliban Reimagined as Holograms | publisher=News Week |date= 15 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">The term '''building engineering physics''' was introduced in a report released in January 2010 commissioned by The Royal Academy of Engineering. The report, entitled ''Engineering a Low Carbon Built Environment: The Discipline of Building Engineering Physics'',  presents the initiative of many at the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in developing a field that addresses our [[fossil fuel]] dependence while working towards a more sustainably built environment for the future.

The field of building engineering physics combines the existing professions of building services engineering, [[applied physics]] and building construction engineering into a single field designed to investigate the energy efficiency of old and new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;King p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of building engineering physics allows the construction and renovation of high performance, energy efficient buildings, while minimizing their environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

Building engineering physics addresses several different areas in building performance including: air movement, thermal performance, control of moisture, ambient energy, acoustics, light, climate and biology.&lt;ref&gt;King pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; This field employs creative ways of manipulating these principal aspects of a building’s indoor and outdoor environments so that a more eco-friendly standard of living is obtained. Building engineering physics is unique from other established applied sciences or engineering professions as it combines the sciences of architecture, engineering and human biology and physiology. Building engineering physics not only addresses energy efficiency and building sustainability, but also a building's internal environment conditions that affect the comfort and performance levels of its occupants.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, a large percentage of buildings were constructed completely dependent on fossil fuels. Rather than focusing on energy efficiency, architects and engineers were more concerned with experimenting with “new materials and structural forms” to further aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the 21st century, building energy performance standards are pushing towards a zero carbon standard in old and new buildings alike. The threat of global change and the need for energy independence and sustainability has prompted governments across the globe to adopt firm carbon reducing standards.  A significant way to meet these stringent standards is in the construction of buildings that minimize environmental impacts, as well as the refurbishing of older buildings to meet carbon emission standards.  The application of building engineering physics can aid in this transition to reduce energy dependent buildings, provide for the demands of a growing population and better standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the application of this field is due in large part to the'' introduction of regulations requiring the calculation of carbon emissions to demonstrate compliance, principally the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)''.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the discipline of building engineering physics is severely impaired by lack of diverse education in the construction industry. Very few in the construction industry know how to apply the principles of building engineering physics and do not have interdisciplinary experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chr. Michelsen Institute.jpg|thumb|Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen]]
The '''Chr. Michelsens Institutt for Videnskap og Åndsfrihet''' (CMI) was founded in 1930, and is currently the largest centre for development research in Scandinavia.  In 1992, the Department for Natural Science and Technology established the ''Christian Michelsen Research AS'', and the CMR Group.(cmr.no) The University of Bergen is the main owner in The CMR Group. The Department of Social Science and Development became the Chr. Michelsen Institute. CMI is an independent, non-profit research foundation for policy-oriented and applied development research. Headed by the director Ottar Mæstad, it employs 40 social scientists, primarily anthropologists, economists and political scientists. CMI receives core funding from the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) and project support from Norwegian state ministries and agencies, and Norwegian and international non-governmental organisations.

CMI hosts the [[Anti-Corruption Resource Centre]], also referred to as U4.

== Research and cooperation ==
The institute’s geographical focus is on [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and partly also [[South America]]. CMI focuses its research around ten thematic areas: [[Aid]], [[Global health]] and development, [[Governance]] and [[corruption]], [[Natural resources]], Peace and conflict, [[Rights]] and legal institutions, [[Public finance]] management, [[Poverty]] dynamics, [[Culture]]s and politics of [[faith]], and [[Gender]] relations from the local to the global.

CMI has formal cooperation agreements with various research institutions in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Through institutional cooperation CMI facilitates joint research and projects, institutional development and competence building. In Norway, CMI has close formal institutional collaborations with the [[University of Bergen]] (UiB) and the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] (NHH), including teaching, joint research projects and support to graduate students and PhD candidates.

== History ==
[[Image:Christian Michelsen.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Christian Michelsen]]
Founded in 1930, the Chr. Michelsen Institute is named after Norwegian statesman [[Christian Michelsen]] (1857-1925). Michelsen bequeathed a large part of his fortune to the establishment of a foundation for science and intellectual freedom. The Chr. Michelsen Institute was established on the founder's birthday, 15 March 1930. In his will, Michelsen specified four areas of priority: humanities, natural sciences, technology and medicine and "cultural and scientific work to foster tolerance between nations and races - religious, social, economic and political." It was the latter formulation that justified a subsequent focus on development issues. 

The economist [[Just Faaland]] and the political scientist [[Stein Rokkan]] initiated and developed broader research programmes and employed more people in the 1950s. They financed the expansion through participation in international research programmes and by mobilising other financial resources. In 1961 they had defined research programmes in international economics and comparative politics. In 1965, the Development Action and Research Programme (DERAP), a development economics project on growth problems in developing countries was formally established. The DERAP model combined research work at the Institute in Bergen with applied and practical work in developing countries, a model to which CMI still adheres. DERAP gradually recruited other social scientists in addition to the economists. In the early 1980s, Just Faaland established a Human Rights Programme which soon grew to become the other main focus in social science research. In 1992, the Department for Natural Science and Technology established the Christian Michelsen Research AS, and the CMR Group.(cmr.no) The University of Bergen is the main owner in CMR. The Department of Social Science and Development became the Chr. Michelsen Institute. DERAP and the Human Rights Programme merged, and research became the main objective. Practical work in developing countries is still important, but long term assignments are replaced by shorter missions and research-co-operation in the South. At the time of CMI’s 75th anniversary in 2005 the institution’s annual turnover was about NOK 55m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5060">'''Chronostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] that studies the age of rock [[stratum|strata]] in relation to [[time]].

The ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to arrange the sequence of deposition and the time of deposition of all rocks within a geological region, and eventually, the entire geologic record of the Earth.

The standard stratigraphic nomenclature is a chronostratigraphic system based on palaeontological intervals of time defined by recognised fossil assemblages ([[biostratigraphy]]). The aim of chronostratigraphy is to give a meaningful [[geochronology|age date]] to these fossil assemblage intervals and interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Methodology ==
Chronostratigraphy relies heavily upon [[isotope geology]] and [[geochronology]] to derive hard dating of known and well defined rock units which contain the specific fossil assemblages defined by the stratigraphic system. As it is practically very difficult to isotopically date most fossils and sedimentary rocks directly, inferences must be made in order to arrive at an age date which reflects the beginning of the interval.

The methodology used is derived from the law of superposition and the principles of cross-cutting relationships.

Because [[igneous]] rocks occur at specific intervals in time and are essentially instantaneous on a geologic time scale, and because they contain mineral assemblages which may be dated more accurately and precisely by isotopic methods, the construction of a chronostratigraphic column relies heavily upon intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.

Metamorphism, often associated with faulting, may also be used to bracket depositional intervals in a chronostratigraphic column. Metamorphic rocks can occasionally be dated, and this may give some limits to the age at which a bed could have been laid down. For example, if a bed containing graptolites overlies crystalline basement at some point, dating the crystalline basement will give a maximum age of that fossil assemblage.

This process requires a considerable degree of effort and checking of field relationships and age dates. For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an intrusive rock cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting intrusive rock in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests.

== Units ==

== Differences from geochronology ==

It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units.&lt;ref name=Fastovsly&amp;Weishampel&gt;{{cite book|last=Fastovsly|first=David E.|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-44496-9|author2=Weishampel, David B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is correct to say that fossils of the species ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series.&lt;ref name=giantsauropod&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J. B.|author2=Lamanna, M.C. |author3=Lacovara, K.J. |author4=Dodson, P.

Thus it is also correct to say that ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' lived during the [[Late Cretaceous]] Epoch.&lt;ref name=ICSchronostrat&gt;International Commission on Stratigraphy. [http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm "Chronostratigraphic Units."] ''International Stratigraphic Guide''. Accessed 14-DEC-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronostratigraphy is an important branch of stratigraphy because the age correlations derived are crucial to drawing accurate cross sections of the spatial organization of rocks and to preparing accurate paleogeographic reconstructions.

The '''conservation and restoration of herbaria''' includes the preventative care, repair, and restoration of [[herbarium]] specimens. This is performed by [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curator]]s, and [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] on herbarium collections in universities and museums. Herbarium specimens may be susceptible to [[water damage]], [[mold]], [[Pest (organism)|pests]], unattached specimens, [[dust]] and [[dirt]], and damage from improper storage conditions. [[Collections care|Preventative conservation]] can prevent much of the damage that could occur.

==Herbarium==
A herbarium is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a herbarium|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|website=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts. These will usually be dried and pressed and mounted on a sheet of paper but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Conserve O Gram - Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of specimens ===
* '''Pressed and dried:''' [[Vascular plant]] (flowering plants, [[conifer]]s, [[fern]]s) specimens are pressed and dried plants that are mounted on herbarium sheets. Various techniques are used to attach the plants with the most common method using archival adhesive and, if necessary, heavier portions of the plant are supported additionally by [[linen]] thread or narrow strips of gum-backed linen tape or polyester film (Mylar). If there are loose [[seed]]s or [[fruit]]s, these are placed in a small fragment packet, which also is glued to the sheet. A label with collection information is glued on the bottom right corner. 
* '''Dried:''' Small [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|hepatics]] or liverworts, and [[hornwort]]s) are dried and placed loose in folded packets. The label is glued on the front of the packet and the packets are filed loose in boxes, glued to sheets of mounting paper, or placed loose in folders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Causes of deterioration==

===Pests===
Common herbarium pests include:[[File:Silverfish 2007-2.jpg|thumb|Silverfish]]
*[[Silverfish]] 
* [[Psocoptera|book lice (psocids)]]
* [[Lasioderma|cigarette or tobacco beetles (Lasioderma]])
* [[Dermestidae|dermestids]]
* [[Drugstore beetle|drugstore beetles (Stegobium paniceum)]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
A reoccurring threat to the longevity of herbarium specimens is insects, a number of which find dried plants palatable. Historically, various methods have been used to kill insects, which either come in with the plants when they are collected or are in the building where the plants are stored.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bio.cgrer.uiowa.edu/herbarium/HerbariaAndSpecimens.htm#driedplants|title=Herbaria and Specimens: What Are They?|last=Horton|first=Diana|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests are commonly treated with two different methods:
* '''Freezing:''' the specimen is placed inside a clear [[polyester]] bag with excess air pushed out and heat sealed, or place inside polythene bags and sealed with parcel tape. Then it is placed into a normal domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of −18&amp;nbsp;°C, or for 72 hours if freezing at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Anoxia:''' this method starves the pests of oxygen. Small anoxic environments are created using sealed barrier films and placing [[oxygen scavenger]]s and [[RH buffer]]s inside before sealing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_botanical_specimens.pdf|title=Care and conservation of botanical specimens|last=|first=|date=2013|website=The Institute of Conservation (Icon) and Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|integrated pest management]] program is cost-effective over time and the best preventative measure against pests.

===Fungal attack===
The primary risk factor for [[Mold|fungal]] attack is incomplete drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterwards, or in collections that become wet later through [[flood]], other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the [[tropics]]. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being wet before being pressed or having water-retaining or [[Succulent plant|succulent]] parts. Specimens with sugary [[Exudate#Plant exudates|exudations]] or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying to ensure that they dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% [[ethanol]] or [[Denatured alcohol|methylated spirits]] (denatured alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications/books/Vascular%20plants.pdf|title=Vascular plants|last=Bedford|first=David J.|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light ===
Herbarium specimens are sensitive to [[Light|visible light]] and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], which can cause fading of biological [[pigment]]s (fading or shifts in color) and/or damage to chemical bonds (weakened or embrittled).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/AppendixT.pdf|title=Appendix T: Curatorial Care of Biological Collections|last=|first=|date=2005|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature and RH ===
High temperatures contribute to [[desiccation]]. The rate of any chemical reaction that damages specimens will double with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature. Excessive moisture in the air (above 65% relative humidity) encourages pest infestation and/or the softening of some adhesives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Preventative care==

===Environment===
Specimens are stored in environmentally controlled storage rooms away from direct sunlight with limited exposure to other light sources to minimize causes of deterioration. Storage rooms are kept at a [[relative humidity]] (RH) level of between 45% and 55%. [[Temperature]] levels are kept between 18&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C. Store rooms are never completely immune to pests. Pest infestations are reduced by the regular vacuuming of storage areas and not allowing any food or drink in the storage rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Sarracenia purpurea herbarium specimens.jpg|thumb|Specimens in front of metal herbarium cabinets.]]

===Storage and handling ===
Specimens are stored in standard herbarium cabinets, as metal shelves can be easily cleaned and a well-sealed cabinet will provide a stable micro-climate for the specimens. Metal cabinets do not release [[volatile organic compound]]s, like wooden cabinets do.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plants are thoroughly dry and free of pests before placing in cabinets to prevent deterioration. Specimens mounted on sheets are kept flat and placed on stiff cardboard or in a box when moving them from cabinets to work spaces to minimize damage during examination. The weight from folders stacked too high can cause damage to lower specimens. Folders are kept specimen-side up and never turned over, so the specimens are never face down. During examinations, handlers review for potential maintenance (loose specimens, unattached specimens, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Leaning on herbarium sheets, writing notes on top of them, or placing heavy items or elbows on them can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Older herbaria specimens may have been treated with toxic chemicals including [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[arsenic]] to prevent pests. Handlers wear [[Medical glove|nitrile]] gloves and work in a well ventilated room when working with specimens prepared earlier than 1989. The card on which the specimen is mounted and the specimen itself may contain the chemicals. The dust on herbaria sheets may be contaminated, so conservators wear a [[dust mask]] and use a dust extractor or [[Fume hood|fume cupboard]] when cleaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Repair and restoration==
===Cleaning=== 
Dust and dirt are removed from herbarium sheets by using a smoke sponge. Conservators gently rub the place where the dirt is and then softly remove any excess with a fine brush.

=== Broken specimens=== 
Broken specimens are reattached to the herbaria sheet using thinly cut strips of archival pre-gummed linen tape. Detached materials such as seeds, leaves, etc., are placed in an acid-free card fragment packet, which is secured onto the sheet with the original specimen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Neuchâtel Herbarium - Equisetum sylvaticum - NEU000001915.tif|thumb|Pressed and dried specimen with linen tape supports.]]

=== Removal from mounting sheet ===
Unattached specimens are removed from the herbaria sheet by humidifying it to make them pliable and removing the plant with a paper lifter (smooth wooden spatula). They are then placed to dry and flatten along with the original mounting sheet and written documentation (label and annotations). The specimen and original documents are then remounted to a new sheet using the original sheet as reference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disaster recovery ===
Unforeseen disasters can occur at any time and [[Emergency response (museum)#Preparedness|disaster recovery]] planning and materials for herbaria are similar to [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]]. Little can be done with burnt specimens and fragmented specimens except to preserve and protect what is left intact. The damage most likely to occur is water damage through natural or man made flooding, such as roof leakage or [[Fire sprinkler system|fire sprinkler]] malfunction. Damaged of waterlogged specimens are frozen to delay deterioration and prevent fungal attack, which gives curators time to evaluate the situation and decide how best to approach the problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'' (1658–1660)]]

'''Dutch Golden Age painting''' is the painting of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a period in Dutch history roughly spanning the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;In general histories 1702 is sometimes taken as the end if the Golden Age, a date which works reasonably well for painting. Slive, who avoids the term (see p. 296), divides his book into two parts: 1600–1675 (294 pages) and 1675–1800 (32 pages).&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the later part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) for Dutch independence.

The new [[Dutch Republic]] was the most prosperous nation in Europe and led European trade, science, and art. The northern [[Terminology of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself.  The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.

Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of [[Baroque painting]], and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including [[Flemish Baroque painting|that of neighbouring Flanders]]. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed [[realism (arts)|realism]] inherited from [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
[[File:Frans Hals 008.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Hals]]' [[tronie]], with the later title ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]''. 1628–30. Oil on wood, {{convert|58|x|52|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The tronie includes elements of portraiture, genre painting, and sometimes history painting.]]

A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct [[genre]]s of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Confusingly, one particular [[genre]] of painting is called [[genre painting]], the painting of some kind of everyday scenes with unidentified people. But, for example, [[still-life]] is also a genre in painting.&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the [[Rampjaar|French invasion of 1672]] is the core of Golden Age painting.  Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories.  Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.

==Types of painting==
[[File:Paulus Potter - Young Bull.JPG|thumb|[[Paulus Potter]], ''[[The Bull (painting)|The Bull]]'' (1647); 3.4 metres wide. An unusually monumental animal painting that challenges the [[hierarchy of genres]].]]

A distinctive feature of the period, compared to earlier European painting, was the limited number of religious paintings. Dutch [[Calvinism]] forbade religious paintings in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and [[still life]]s of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.

The widely held theory of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" in painting, whereby some types were regarded as more prestigious than others, led many painters to want to produce history painting. However this was the hardest to sell, as even Rembrandt found. Many were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. In descending order of status, the categories in the hierarchy were:
*[[history painting]], including [[Allegory|allegories]] and popular religious subjects.
*[[Portrait painting]], including the ''[[tronie]]''
*[[Genre works|genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|landscape]], including seascapes, battlescenes, cityscapes, and ruins (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;) 
*[[still life]]

The Dutch concentrated heavily on the "lower" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating, fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface, many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from [[printmaking]]. In turn, the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. 

There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in [[tomb monument]]s and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. Painted [[delftware]] tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the [[auricular style]], led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.

==The art world==
[[File:Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirck Hals]], genre scene of ''Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior''. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also [[commons:File:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Tailor's Workshop.jpg|here]].]]

Foreigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold – it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 15, citing [[Jonathan Israel]]. Perhaps only 1% survive today, and "only about 10% of these were of real quality".&lt;/ref&gt;  The volume of production meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods, there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who had fallen out of fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as [[Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Rembrandt]] in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Steen]] was an innkeeper, [[Aelbert Cuyp]] was one of many whose wealthy wives persuaded them to give up painting, although [[Karel Dujardin]] seems to have run away from his to continue his work. Conversely [[Jan van de Cappelle]] came from a very wealthy family, and [[Joachim Wtewael]] was a self-made [[flax]] tycoon. See their biographies in MacLaren. The fish artist [[Jacob Gillig]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qkW3ff-NRZoC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Jacob+Gillig%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacob%20Gillig%22&amp;f=false also worked as a warder in the Utrecht prison, conveniently close to the fish market.] Bankrupts included: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan de Bray, and many others.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the French invasion of 1672 (the ''[[Rampjaar]]'', or "year of disaster"), brought a severe depression to the art market, which never quite returned to earlier heights.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 217 and ff. on 1672 and its effects.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pictures was very wide: "yea many tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers etts., will have some picture or other by their Forge and in their stalle. Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting" reported an English traveller in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this "oft-quoted" remark "undoubtedly exaggerated".&lt;/ref&gt;  There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like [[Vermeer]] and his father, [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Willem Kalf]]. Rembrandt's dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] and his son [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh|Gerrit]] were among the most important.  Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]], whose self-portrait is the second from the left]]

The technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master.  Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations.  The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the [[Guild of Saint Luke]].  In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting.  Several new guilds were established in the period: [[Amsterdam]] in 1579, [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|Haarlem]] in 1590, and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leiden]] authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no long worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with [[academies]], often only concerned with the training of artists.  [[The Hague]], with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the [[Confrerie Pictura]].  With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done "speculatively" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries – one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"&gt;Fuchs, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelder Selbstbildnis m hässlicher Frau@Städel Museum Frankfurt20170818.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aert de Gelder]], ''Self-portrait as [[Zeuxis]]'' (1685)]]

There were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]] for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities such as [[Haarlem]] and [[Utrecht]] were more important in the first half of the century, with [[Leiden]] and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as [[Flanders]] and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are [[Karel van Mander]] (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' – "The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters", 1718–21). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, [[Vasari]] in including a great number of short lives of artists – over 500 in Houbraken's case – and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters.

The German artist [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606–1688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his ''Deutsche Akademie'' in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627–1678), whose ''Zichtbare wereld'' and ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.&lt;ref&gt;See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

==History painting==
[[File:Danae by Van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Loo]], ''[[Danaë]]'' (compare [[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Rembrandt's treatment]])]]

This category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and [[allegory|allegorical]] scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of [[Mannerist]] allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the [[Dutch Revolt]], which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', "Prologue" pp.&amp;nbsp;27–43, 1945, Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;  History painting was now a "minority art", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-3&lt;/ref&gt;

More than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of [[Caravaggio]]. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the [[Bentvueghels]] club in Rome.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

[[File:Dirk van Baburen - Kroning met de doornenkroon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utrecht Caravaggism]]: [[Dirck van Baburen]], ''Christ crowned with thorns'', 1623, for a convent in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], not a market available in most of Holland.]]

In the early part of the century many [[Northern Mannerist]] artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of [[Abraham Bloemaert]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) [[Adam Elsheimer]] as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like [[Pieter Lastman]], Rembrandt's master, and Jan and [[Jacob Pynas]]. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the "Pre-Rembrandtists", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utrecht Caravaggism]] describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, [[Paulus Bor]], [[Jacob van Velsen]], plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage.[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/catholic_church.html]  [[Jacob Jordaens]] was among Flemish Protestant artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artists were [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 22-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Rembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his [[etching]]s are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; [[Govaert Flinck]] was the most successful.  [[Gerard de Lairesse]] (1640–1711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or "Italian" peasants.

==Portraits==
[[File:Portrait sophia trip wife of balthasar coymans.jpg|thumb|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''Sophia Trip'' (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beernink.com/articles/triptree.htm?timeline=off Trip family tree]. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228).&lt;/ref&gt;  Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: "artists travel along this road without delight", according to van Mander.&lt;ref&gt;Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting ''en masse'', as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

[[File:Willem Heythuijsen by Frans Hals 1634.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frans Hals]], ''Willem Heythuijsen'' (1634), {{convert|47|x|37|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]
[[File:Van den Kerckhoven door Jan Mijtens.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johannes Mytens|Jan Mijtens]], family portrait, 1652, with the boys in "picturesque" dress.]]

The other great portraitist of the period is [[Frans Hals]], whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely "nonchalant pose" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: "no other portrait from this period is so informal".&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 118&lt;/ref&gt;  The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 130 and 114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan de Bray]] encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. [[Thomas de Keyser]], [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists.

From what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;  As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73&lt;/ref&gt; Lace and [[ruff]] collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as "picturesque" or "Roman" dress.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display.

A distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the [[tronie]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. [[Jan Lievens]] and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.

Family portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood.  Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's [[schutterij]] or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter.  Rembrandt's ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.

[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|350px|''The [[Meagre Company]]'', an Amsterdam [[militia group portrait]] or ''schutterstuk'' by [[Frans Hals]] and [[Pieter Codde]] (1633-37)]]

Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632, [[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]). Boards of trustees in their ''[[regentenstuk]]'' portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.

Most [[militia group portrait]]s were commissioned in [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]], and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger.  Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition.  Rembrandt's famous ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' better known as the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works.

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdams Historisch Museum]]; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.

==Scenes of everyday life==
[[File:Jan Steen 004b.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Jan Steen]] picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.&lt;ref&gt;Another version at [[Apsley House]], with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Genre paintings]] show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached – they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. There were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, "[[merry company]]" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to "genre painting" – until the late 18th century the English often called them "drolleries".&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size.

Though genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many which seemed only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message – the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation – the works of [[Jan Steen]], whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which [[Svetlana Alpers]]' ''The Art of Describing'' (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] (1625), punning visually on the [[lute]] in this brothel scene]]

The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf On Diderot's Art Criticism. Mira Friedman, p. 36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steen above is very clearly an ''exemplum'', and though each of the individual components of it is realistically depicted, the overall scene is not a plausible depiction of a real moment; typically of genre painting, it is a situation that is depicted, and satirized.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 39-42, analyses two comparable scenes by Steen and Dou, and p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] tradition of recondite [[emblem books]] had, in the hands of the 17th-century Dutch – almost universally literate in the vernacular, but mostly without education in the classics – turned into the popularist and highly moralistic works of [[Jacob Cats]], [[Roemer Visscher]], and others, often based in popular [[proverb]]s. The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch [[slang]] terms in the sexual area: the [[vagina]] could be represented by a [[lute]] (''luit'') or [[stocking]] (''kous''), and sex by a bird (''vogelen''), among many other options,&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.

[[File:Peasants in an Interior (1661) Adriaen van Ostade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen van Ostade]], ''Peasants in an Interior'' (1661)]]

The same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work – they massively outnumber similar treatments of men.  In fact working class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 1&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,&lt;ref&gt;Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)]], claimed by different art historians for each tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following.

The tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The [[Haarlem]] painters [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Esaias van de Velde]] were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted "[[Merry company|merry companies]]" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. 
[[File:Gabriël Metsu 006.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Metsu]], ''The Hunter's Gift'', c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of [[Cupid]] presides over the scene.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Van de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

A stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes [[Adriaen Brouwer]], from 1625 or 1626, gave [[Adriaen van Ostade]] his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, [[Judith Leyster]] (1609–1660), specialized in these, before her husband, [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], prevailed on her to give up painting. The [[Leiden]] school of ''[[fijnschilder]]'' ("fine painters") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included [[Gerard Dou]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]], and later his son [[Willem van Mieris]], [[Godfried Schalcken]], and [[Adriaen van der Werff]].

This later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]], whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with [[Jan Vermeer]], long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.

==Landscapes and cityscapes==
[[File:Esaias van de Velde Winter Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Esaias van de Velde]], ''Winter Landscape'' (1623)]]

[[Landscape art|Landscape painting]] was a major genre in the 17th century. Flemish landscapes (particularly from [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier [[Netherlandish]] landscape painting in the "[[world landscape]]" tradition of [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and the early [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations.

Important early figures in the move to realism were [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630) and [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585–1634), both also mentioned above as genre painters – in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the "tonal phase" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were [[Jan van Goyen]] (1596–1656), [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] (1602–1670), [[Pieter de Molyn]] (1595–1661), and in marine painting [[Simon de Vlieger]] (1601–1653), with a host of minor figures – a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 189 – the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede 1670 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''The Windmill at Wijk'' (1670)]]
[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Rivierlandschap met ruiters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''River landscape with Riders'' (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings.]]

From the 1650s the "classical phase" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single "heroic tree", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artist was [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1628–1682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced "Nordic" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.&lt;ref&gt;Derived from works by [[Allart van Everdingen]] who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  

His pupil was [[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638–1709), best known for his atypical ''[[Avenue at Middelharnis]]'' (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were [[Aelbert Cuyp]] (1620–1691) and [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky.

A different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean [[staffage]] and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. [[Jan Both]] (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with [[Claude Lorrain]], was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were [[Nicolaes Berchem]] (1620–1683) and [[Adam Pijnacker]]. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"&gt;Slive, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589–c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.&lt;ref&gt;Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive – how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aert van der Neer]] (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.

Landscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, [[Paulus Potter]] (1625–1654), [[Albert Jansz. Klomp]] (1625-1688), [[Adriaen van de Velde]] (1636–1672) and [[Karel Dujardin]] (1626–1678, farm animals), with [[Philips Wouwerman]] painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's ''The Young Bull'' is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.
[[File:Assetimage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], ''[[Assendelft]] Church'', 1649, with the gravestone of [[Jan Saenredam|his father]] in the foreground.]]

Architecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by [[Dirck van Delen]]. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors.

[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], whose father [[Jan Saenredam]] engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of [[Emanuel de Witte]], who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam.  [[Gerard Houckgeest]], followed by van Witte and [[Hendrick van Vliet]], had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 268-273&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Gerrit Berckheyde]] specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; [[Jan van der Heyden]] preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 273-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime painting==
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the "tonal phase".]]

The [[Dutch Republic]] relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of [[marine art|maritime painting]] was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;  Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

More often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Hendrick Dubbels]] and [[Abraham Storck]].  [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Still lifes==
[[File:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Claesz]], ''Vanitas'' (1630)]]

[[Still lifes]] were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.

Several types of subject were recognised: ''banketje'' were "banquet pieces", ''ontbijtjes'' simpler "breakfast pieces".&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life – this is known as the [[vanitas]] theme – implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century.

[[File:Pronkstillleven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham van Beijeren]] (c. 1660); "ostentatious" still life.]]

Initially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century ''[[pronkstilleven]]s'' ("ostentatious still lifes"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]], became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100349439?rskey=FT16aA&amp;result=0&amp;q=pronkstilleven Pronkstilleven] in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms&lt;/ref&gt; The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 113-6&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (1595–c. 1680) and [[Willem Kalf]] (1619–1693) led the change to the ''pronkstilleven'', while [[Pieter Claesz]] (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler "ontbijt" ("breakfast pieces"), or explicit ''vanitas'' pieces.

In all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] (1606–1684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in [[Antwerp]]. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.

[[File:Jakob Gillig - Freshwater Fish.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Gillig]], ''Freshwater Fish'' (1684)]]
Flower paintings formed a sub-group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQLqRd7hJq0C&amp;pg=PA984&amp;dq=Houbraken+Leyster&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0M61S8yHOuKJ4gbB1oWbCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Houbraken%20Leyster&amp;f=false and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time – even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in  [[delftware]] [[Tulipiere|tulip-holder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch tradition was largely begun by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573–1621), a Flemish-born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of [[Willem van Aelst]] (1627–1683). Painters from [[Leiden]], The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.

Dead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet – [[Abraham van Beijeren]] did many of these.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 287-291&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting – they would have been considered prideful in portraits – and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen – Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.

==Foreign lands==
[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazilië Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|[[Frans Post]], scene in [[Dutch Brazil]]; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost.]]
For Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's ''Schilderboeck'' was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so.  However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

Many Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; [[printmaking]] was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The [[Dutch Gift]] to [[Charles II of England]] was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir [[Peter Lely]] followed by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish [[Anthony van Dyck]] before the [[English Civil War]]. The marine painters van der Velde, [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]], were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as [[Hendrick Danckerts]].

The [[Bamboccianti]] were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy.  [[Jan Weenix]] and [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge [[overdoor]]s across Northern Europe.  

Although the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of [[Dutch Brazil]] turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdger Joppien. "The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists," in ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil'', ed. Ernst van den Boogaart, et al. 297-376. The Hague: Johan Maurits van Nassau Stichting, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most well known of these artists were [[Frans Post]], a landscapist, and a still life painter, [[Albert Eckhout]], who produced ethnographic paintings of Brazil's population. These were originally displayed in the Great Hall of the Vrijburg Palace in [[Recife]].&lt;!--  Eckhout's drawings influenced [[Jan van Kessel]]'s {{dn}} work in Antwerp.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic'', pp. 171-72. With the Portuguese replacementr of the Dutch, Maurits gave the Vrijburg Palace paintings to [[Frederick III of Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a market in Amsterdam for such paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Michiel van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 2017, pp. 150-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Post continued to produce Brazilian scenes for years after his return to the Netherlands.  The [[Dutch East Indies]] were covered much less well artistically.

==Subsequent reputation==
[[File:Philips Wouwerman - Travelers Awaiting a Ferry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philips Wouwerman]], ''Travelers Awaiting a Ferry'' (1649); a landscape with Wouwerman's trademark highlight of a white horse.]]

The enormous success of 17th-century Dutch painting overpowered the work of subsequent generations, and no Dutch painter of the 18th century—nor, arguably, a 19th-century one before [[Van Gogh]]—is well known outside the Netherlands. Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists.

If only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of [[Old Master]] paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]] and over 50 in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 212&lt;/ref&gt;  But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for [[Rembrandt]], especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden [[fijnschilders]] had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and ''passim'', and listings for individual artists&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others. However the fact that so many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates that the quality of individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 483-4, and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of [[Adriaen Coorte]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 319&lt;/ref&gt; and the landscapists [[Jacobus Mancaden]] and [[Frans Post]] earlier in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerard ter Borch (II) 019.jpg|thumb|[[Gerard ter Borch]], ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', or ''Brothel Scene'' (c. 1654; Amsterdam version).]]

Genre paintings were long popular, but little-regarded. In 1780 [[Horace Walpole]] disapproved that they "invite laughter to divert itself with the nastiest indelicacy of boors".&lt;ref&gt;"Advertisement" or Preface to Vol. 4 of the 2nd edition of ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s notebooks, page ix, 1782, J. Dodwell, London, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AzRo__K1AqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], the English leader of 18th-century [[academic art]], made several revealing comments on Dutch art. He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's ''Milkmaid'' (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the "patience" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the [[High Renaissance]], so that his talent could have been put to better use.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen)&lt;/ref&gt;  By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', as it was then known, by [[Gerard ter Borch]]. This was praised by [[Goethe]] and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel – there are two versions (Berlin &amp; Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a "tell-tale coin" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title ''Brothel Scene''. Franits, 146-7, citing Alison Kettering, says there is "deliberate vagueness" as to the subject, and still uses the title ''Paternal Admonition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 18th century, the down to earth realism of Dutch painting was a "[[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] taste" in England, and in France associated with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and aspirations for political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, I, 11-15. Quote p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, with a near-universal respect for realism, and the final decline of the hierarchy of genres, contemporary painters began to borrow from genre painters both their realism and their use of objects for narrative purposes, and paint similar subjects themselves, with all the genres the Dutch had pioneered appearing on far larger canvases (still lifes excepted).

In landscape painting, the Italianate artists were the most influential and highly regarded in the 18th century, but [[John Constable]] was among those Romantics who denounced them for artificiality, preferring the tonal and classical artists.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"/&gt;  In fact both groups remained influential and popular in the 19th century.

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|chapter=Language change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

'''For all practical purposes (FAPP)''' is a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach towards the problem of incompleteness of every [[science|scientific]] [[theory]] and the usage of [[Limit (mathematics)|asymptotical]] [[approximation]]s.

When a [[physicist]] makes an approximation - which can not be justified on rigorous grounds - he or she may attempt to justify it by saying the results obtained are good for all practical purposes (FAPP). Meaning they agree with our experience and [[approximation error]]s cannot be detected in practical [[measurement]]s (for instance, if the error is smaller than the measurement resolution).

FAPP theories are incomplete or lackly-based theories that nevertheless have very high agreement with experiments and tend to be very useful for all practical purposes.

'''Forensic dentistry''' or '''forensic odontology''' is the application of dental knowledge to those criminal and civil laws that are enforced by police agencies in a [[criminal justice system]]. Forensic dentists are involved in assisting investigative agencies to identify recovered [[Cadaver|human remains]] in addition to the identification of whole or fragmented bodies; forensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining age, [[race (human classification)|race]], [[job|occupation]], previous dental history and [[socioeconomic status]] of unidentified human beings.

Forensic dentistry is the proper handling, [[Inspection|examination]] and [[evaluation]] of [[dentistry|dental]] [[evidence]], which will be then presented in the interest of [[justice]]. The evidence that may be derived from [[teeth]] is the age (in children) and identification of the person to whom the teeth belong. This is done using dental records including [[radiograph]]s, ante-mortem (prior to death) and post-mortem (after death) [[photograph]]s and [[DNA]]. "Forensic odontology" is derived from [[Latin]], meaning a forum or where legal matters are discussed.

The other type of evidence is that of bite marks, left on either the victim (by the attacker), the perpetrator (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the [[crime scene]]. Bite marks are often found on [[child abuse|children who are abused]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Forensic dentists are responsible for six main areas of practice:

* Identification of found [[Human body|human remains]]
* Identification in [[Mass fatality incident|mass fatalities]]
* Assessment of bite mark injuries
* Assessment of cases of abuse (such as child, [[spousal abuse|spousal]] or [[elder abuse]])
* Civil cases involving [[malpractice]]
* Age estimation

==Background==
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 060921-A-4543J-003.jpg|thumb|Forensic dentistry]]

Forensic odontology is the study of dental applications in [[legal proceeding]]s. The subject covers a wide variety of topics including individual identification, mass identification, and bite mark analysis. The study of odontology in a [[legal case]] can be a piece of incriminating evidence or an aspect of wide controversy.

There have been many cases throughout history which have made use of bite marks as evidence. Bite marks are usually seen in cases involving [[sexual assault]], [[murder]], and child abuse and can be a major factor in leading to a [[conviction]]. Biting is often a sign of the perpetrator seeking to degrade the victim while also achieving complete domination.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, John E., Mark Olshaker (1995). ''Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit.'' New York: Scribner. {{ISBN|978-0-671-01375-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bite marks can be found anywhere on a body, particularly on soft, fleshy [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] such as the [[stomach]] or [[buttocks]]. In addition, bite marks can be found on objects present at the scene of a crime. Bite marks are commonly found on a suspect when a victim attempts to defend him/herself.

==High-profile criminal cases==
Forensic odontology has played a key role in famous criminal cases:

In 1692, during the [[Salem Witch Trials]], Rev. [[George Burroughs]] was accused of [[witchcraft]] and conspiring with the [[Devil]], with biting his victims supposedly being evidence of his crimes. His bite marks and the bite marks of other people were compared to the victim's marks. The judges readily accepted the bite marks as evidence and this was the first time in what would become the United States that bite marks were used as evidence to solve a crime. He was later convicted and hanged. About two decades later, he was exonerated by the State, and his children compensated for the wrongful execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SAL_BBUR.HTM George Burroughs]. Law2.umkc.edu. Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first published accounts involving a conviction based on bite marks as evidence was the “Gorringe case”, in 1948, in which pathologist [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] used bite marks on the breast of the victim to seal a murder conviction against Robert Gorringe for the murder of his wife Phyllis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forensic-dentistry.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Biblio_2_Taylor_1963_BDJ1.pdf |author=Taylor, D. V. |title=The Law and the Dentist |journal=[[British Dental Journal]] |volume=114 |year=1963 |pages=389–393 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328133927/http://www.forensic-dentistry.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Biblio_2_Taylor_1963_BDJ1.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early case was ''Doyle v. State'', which occurred in Texas in 1954. The bite mark in this case was on a piece of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same set of teeth. The conviction in this case set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt;
Another landmark case was ''People v. Marx'', which occurred in California in 1975.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; A woman was murdered by strangulation after being sexually assaulted. She was bitten several times on her nose. Walter Marx was identified as a suspect and dental impressions were made of his teeth. Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman’s injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman’s nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

==Organizations==
Four organizations are dedicated to the field of forensic odontology, in the USA. These organizations include: the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD), the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO), [[American Society of Forensic Odontology (ASFO)]] and the International Organization for Forensic Odonto-Stomatology (IOFOS).Other countries have their own forensic Odontological societies, including the British Association for Forensic Odontology (BAFO) and the Australian Society of Forensic Odontology (AuSFO). In 1996, BOLD was created at the [[University of British Columbia]] to develop new technology and techniques in forensic odontology. The University of British Columbia program is the only one in North America that provides graduate training in forensic odontology.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldlab.ubc.ca |title=Bureau of Legal Dentistry |publisher=boldlab.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Legal Dentistry encourages the use of multiple dental impressions to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, dental impressions collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple dental impressions in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks to the teeth of a suspect.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt; The organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; This database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.

In 1984, the ABFO began making an attempt to diminish the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that reduces the risk of biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess the degree to which a suspect’s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://abfo.org American Board of Forensic Odontology]. Abfo.org. Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist’s collection methods were not standardized.
Kouble and Craig used a simplified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines in order to retain accuracy with a larger sample of comparisons. A numerical score was assigned to represent the degree of similarity between the bite mark and model/overlay. The higher the score, the greater the similarity. In order to simplify the model, some features that were individually scored in the ABFO guidelines such as arch size and shape were assessed together while certain distinctive features such as spacing between teeth were treated as a separate variable. The authors believe that a simplified version would increase the strength of the comparison process.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kouble RF, Craig GT |year=2004|title=A comparison between direct and indirect methods available for human bite mark analysis|journal= Journal of Forensic Science|volume= 49|issue=1|pages= 111–118|pmid=14979355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to improve guidelines used to collect dental evidence, IOFOS developed one of the most recognized systems for the collection of forensic dental evidence&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odont.uio.no/foreninger/iofos/iofos_st.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209203241/http://www.odont.uio.no/foreninger/iofos/iofos_st.htm |archivedate=2009-02-09 |title=International Organization of Forensic Odonto-Stomatology Regulations (1987) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vermylen, Y. |title=Guidelines in Forensic Odontology: legal aspects|pmid=16563684|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.002|year=2006|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=159|pages=S6–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a group called Forensic Odontology for Human Rights was inaugurated in Lyon during the Interpol DVI{{clarify|date=October 2017}} annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentify.me|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.dentify.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an association of civil protection called Dental Team DVI Italia was founded in [[Bari, Italy]], in order to offer pro bono services in the field of human identification and DVI Disaster Victim Identification to support Italian DVI teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentalteamdvi.it|title=Dental Team DVI Italia - Associazione di operatori tecnici delle scienze forensi esperti nella identificazione delle vittime di disastri (D.V.I.

==Bite mark analysis==
Upon collection of dental evidence, the forensic odontologist analyzes and compares the bite marks. Studies have been performed in an attempt to find the simplest, most efficient, and most reliable way of analyzing bite marks.

Bites can occur on both the victim and the suspect; [[teeth]] are used as weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim. Although they are only a small portion of most forensic dentist’s case load, bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Alternatively they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense. Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. There is also no set standard by which to analyse and compare bite marks.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of bite mark identification include time-dependent changes of the bite mark on living bodies, effects of where the bite mark was found, damage on soft tissue, and similarities in dentition among individuals. Other factors include poor photography, impressions, or measurement of dentition characteristics.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Al-Talabani N, Al-Moussawy, ND, Baker FA, Mohammed HA|year=2006|title=Digital analysis of experimental human bitemarks: application of two new methods|pmid=17199623|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1372–5|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00265.x|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most bite mark analysis studies use porcine skin (pigskin), because it is comparable to the skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Martin-de las Heras S, Valenzuela A, Valverde AJ, Torres JC, Luna-del-Castillo JD |title=Effectiveness of comparison overlays generated with DentalPrint software in bite mark analysis|pmid=17209928|year=2007|volume=52|issue=1|pages=151–6|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00321.x|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; suggest using a [[G-clamp]] on an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.

Kouble and Craig compared direct methods and indirect methods of bite mark analysis. In the past, the direct method compared a model of the suspect’s teeth to a life-size photograph of the actual bite mark. In these experiments, direct comparisons were made between dental models and either photographs or "fingerprint powder lift-models." The "fingerprint powder lift" technique involves dusting the bitten skin with black fingerprint powder and using fingerprint tape to transfer the bite marks onto a sheet of [[acetate]]. Indirect methods involve the use of transparent overlays to record a suspect’s biting edges. Transparent overlays are made by free-hand tracing the occlusal surfaces of a dental model onto an acetate sheet. When comparing the “fingerprint powder lift” technique against the photographs, the use of photographs resulted in higher scores determined by a modified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines. The use of transparent overlays is considered subjective and irreproducible because the tracing can be easily manipulated. On the other hand, photocopier-generated overlays where no tracing is used is considered to be the best method in matching the correct bite mark to the correct set of models without the use of computer imaging.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

While the photocopier-generated technique is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays have proven to be more accurate.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Two recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. Use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between incisal edges to indicate the tooth width. Use of the painting method entails coating the incisal edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 variables were used in analysis. Identification for both methods were based on canine-to-canine distance (one variable), incisor width (four variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (eight variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.&lt;ref name="Al-Talabani"/&gt;

===Criticism of bite mark analysis===
Recently, the scientific foundation of forensic odontology, and especially bite mark comparison, has been called into question. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63% rate of false identifications.&lt;ref name="Not So"&gt;Santos, Fernanda (January 28, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28santos.html Evidence From Bite Marks, It Turns Out, Is Not So Elementary]. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-041019forensics,0,7597688.story |title= From the start, a faulty science
|first= Flynn|last= McRoberts|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date= 2004-10-19|accessdate= 2008-07-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended that bite mark evidence not be used in criminal prosecutions until it had a more firm scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastribune.org/2016/02/12/commission-recommends-restriction-bite-mark-eviden/ Commission Wants Restriction of Bite-Mark Evidence]. The Texas Tribune (2016-02-12). Retrieved on 2016-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigative series by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' entitled "Forensics under the Microscope" examined many forensic science disciplines to see if they truly deserve the air of infallibility that has come to surround them. The investigators concluded that bite mark comparison is always subjective and no standards for comparison have been accepted across the field. The journalists discovered that no rigorous experimentation has been conducted to determine error rates for bite mark comparison, a key part of the [[scientific method]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Critics of bite mark comparison cite the case of [[Ray Krone]], an Arizona man convicted of murder on bite mark evidence left on a woman's breast. DNA evidence later implicated another man and Krone was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-0411290148nov29,0,1894615.story Bite-mark verdict faces new scrutiny.] Chicago Tribune; November 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Roy Brown was convicted of murder due in part to bite-mark evidence, and freed after DNA testing of the saliva left in the bite wounds matched someone else.&lt;ref name="Not So"/&gt;

Although bite mark analysis has been used in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore&lt;ref name="DeVore"&gt;{{cite journal|author=DeVore DT|title=Bite Marks for identification? A preliminary report|pmid=5136610|year=1971|volume=11|issue=3|pages=144–5|journal=Medicine, science, and the law|doi=10.1177/002580247101100309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbenel and Evans&lt;ref name="Barbenel"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barbenel JC, Evans JH |title=Bite marks in skin – mechanical factors|doi=10.1016/S0015-7368(74)70908-2|year=1974|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–8|pmid=4443779}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred, which can be a difficult if not an impossible task to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be due to the fact that such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt;

Bite mark analysis is also controversial because dental profiles are subject to change. The loss of teeth or the alteration of arch configuration through a variety of procedures is common in human populations. The onset of oral diseases such as dental caries has been shown to alter the arch and tooth configuration and must be taken into account when comparing a dental profile to the bite mark after a significant amount of time has passed since the mark was made.&lt;ref name="Dorion"&gt;Dorion, Robert BJ. ''Bitemark Evidence''. NY: Marcel Dekker, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8247-5414-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the methods behind collecting bite mark evidence at the scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life-sized photographs to computer enhanced three-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, and there is no set standard by which to compare or analyze them.&lt;ref name="Pretty"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pretty IA, Sweet D |title=The scientific basis for human bitemark analyses – a critical review|pmid=11393946|year=2001|volume=41|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(01)71859-X|journal=Science &amp; Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body is the result of a bite.&lt;ref name="Dorion"/&gt; Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.

One possible issue facing bite mark analysis is a lack of bite mark uniqueness in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumptions that the dental characteristics of anterior teeth involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted uniqueness is transferred and recorded in the injury.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; However, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=MacFarlane TW, MacDonald DG, Sutherland DA |title= Statistical problems in dental identification |pmid=4613797 |year=1974 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=247–52 |journal=Journal – Forensic Science Society|doi=10.1016/s0015-7368(74)70911-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported the notion of dental uniqueness, but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; In another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find uniqueness between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental uniqueness in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer comparison of bitemark patterns in identical twins|journal= Journal of the American Dental Association |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=449–451 |url=http://jada.ada.org/content/105/3/449.short|pmid=6957451|year=1982|last1=Sognnaes|first1=RF|last2=Rawson|first2=RD|last3=Gratt|first3=BM|last4=Nguyen|first4=NB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties.&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; In a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its uniqueness and make a positive identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strom F.|url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/42/1/312.full.pdf |title=Investigation of Bite-Marks|pmid=13978931|year=1963|volume=42 | issue = 1Pt 2|pages=312–6|journal=Journal of Dental Research|doi=10.1177/00220345630420013301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berg | first1 = S | last2 = Schaidt | first2 = G | year = 1954 | title = Methodik und Beweiswert des Bissspurenvergleiches | url = | journal = Kriminalwiss | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 128–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.

Rawson et al. determined that if five teeth marks can be matched to five teeth, it can be said with confidence that only one person could have caused the bite, and if eight teeth were matched to marks this would be a certainty. However, in this study the probabilities used to make this claim are based on the assumption that the position of each tooth was independent of all the others.&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rawson R. |author2=Ommen R. |author3=Kinard G. |author4=Johnson J. |author5=Yfantis A. |doi=10.1520/JFS11656J|volume= 29|issue =1 |year=1984|pages=245–253|title=Statistical evidence for the individuality of the human dentition|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pretty"/&gt; This is probably unrealistic because there are a number of ways that the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces apply force to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.

One particular case that highlighted the lack of uniqueness in bite marks involved two suspects accused of attacking a man who had sustained a bite mark injury.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lack of dental uniqueness between two bite mark suspects|pmid=11714165|year=2001|last1=Pretty|first1=IA|last2=Turnbull|first2=MD|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1487–91|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two separate forensic dentists, one representing the prosecution and one the defense, were brought in to analyze the mark. They reported conflicting results. One found the mark to come from suspect A and the other said it was from suspect B. This disagreement resulted from the fact that even though the two suspects had dental features making them unique, the bite mark itself was not detailed enough to reflect them. Therefore, the mark could have reasonably come from either of the men.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"/&gt; The equivocal outcome demonstrated in the case emphasizes the difficulty in proving uniqueness.

Most of the controversies facing bite mark analysis are due to the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960 to 1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.&lt;ref name="Pretty2"/&gt;

There have been several instances when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has shed some light on the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of ''Mississippi vs. Bourne'', the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendant’s teeth.&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16600549 |title=Problem-based analysis of bitemark misidentifications: the role of DNA |year=2006 |last1=Bowers |first1=CM |volume=159 Suppl 1 |pages=S104–9 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.032 |journal=Forensic Science International}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsgov.com/forensic-odontology.html Forensic Odontology explained]. ITSGOV: CSI and Forensics Science&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''State vs. Krone'', the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Greco-Buddhism''', or '''Graeco-Buddhism''', is the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed between the 4th century BC and the 5th century AD in [[Bactria]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[satraps]] were then conquered by the [[Mauryan Empire]], under the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The Mauryan [[Emperor Ashoka]] would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Greco-Buddhism continued to flourish under the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], [[Indo-Greek Kingdoms]], and [[Kushan Empire]]. Buddhism was adopted in Central and Northeastern [[Asia]] from the 1st century AD, ultimately spreading to [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Siberia]], and [[Vietnam]].

{{See also|History of Buddhism}}
The introduction of [[Hellenistic Greece]] started when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and further regions of [[Central Asia]] in 334 BC. Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.

Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or "successors" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.

The [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare
30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper&lt;/ref&gt; As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the [[Shunga Empire]], and of the revolt of [[Bactria]] in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] Kingdom (250–125&amp;nbsp;BC). The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– AD&amp;nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st–3rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.

[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].

==Cultural interaction==
{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}
The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.

===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325&amp;nbsp;BC)===
[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|"Victory coin" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&amp;nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.&lt;br/&gt;Silver. [[British Museum]].]]
When Alexander invaded [[Bactria]] and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under [[Śramaṇa|Sramanic]] influence, likely Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]]. According to a legend preserved in the [[Pali Canon]], two [[merchant]] brothers from [[Kamsabhoga]] in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against [[King Porus]] of [[Pauravas]] in the Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.

===Mauryan empire (322–183&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist monasticism}}
The Indian emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], reconquered around 322&amp;nbsp;BC the northwest Indian territory that had been lost to [[Alexander the Great]]. However, contacts were kept with his Greco-Iranian neighbours in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Emperor [[Seleucus I Nicator]] came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty,&lt;ref&gt;"The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of Antigonus and some afterward." [[Appian]] ''History of Rome'', The Syrian Wars [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html 55]&lt;/ref&gt; and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], resided at the Mauryan court.

[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hellenistic]] [[Pataliputra capital]], discovered in [[Pataliputra]], capital of the [[Maurya Empire]], dated to the 3rd century BC.]]
Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals ([[ahimsa]]), and general precepts regulating the life of lay people.

According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of the Greek edicts: {{cite book|title=Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXdfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|date=2 December 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-25530-2|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], the official language of the [[Achaemenids]], he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the [[Hellenistic period]]:
{{quote|The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas [4,000 miles] away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] (Antiyoga) rules, and beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]] (Turamaya), [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]] (Antikini), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (Maka) and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] (Alikasu[n]dara) rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], and as far as [[Tamraparni]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb.13]], Full text of the Edicts of Ashoka. [http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html See Rock Edict 13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028175927/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |date=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}
Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pali]] sources as leading Greek ("[[Yona]]") Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020052522/http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html|title=Chapter XII|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), founding the eponymous [[Dharmaguptaka]] school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=62|title=Abstract Sujato: Sects &amp; Sectarianism|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] ({{circa|300}}–145&amp;nbsp;BC) was located at the doorstep of [[India]].]]
Alexander had established in Bactria several cities ([[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Bagram]]) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the [[Maurya Empire]], such as the historian [[Megasthenes]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya]], and later [[Deimachus]] under his son [[Bindusara]], who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:&lt;ref&gt;Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Megasthenes makes a different division of the philosophers, saying that they are of two kinds, one of which he calls the [[Brahman|Brachmanes]], and the other the [[Sramana|Sarmanes]]..." [[Strabo]] XV. 1. 58-60&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"/&gt;}}
The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of [[Ai-Khanoum]]. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the [[Shunga Empire]] around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], under which Buddhism was able to flourish.

===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;10)===
[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|350px|Greek Gods and the "Wheel of the Law" or [[Dharmachakra]]: '''Left:''' [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], who hands a victory [[wreath]] over a Dharmachakra (coin of [[Menander II]]). '''Right:''' Divinity wearing [[chlamys]] and [[petasus]] pushing a Dharmachakra, with legend "He who sets in motion the Wheel of the Law" ([[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]]).]]
{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}
The Greco-Bactrians conquered parts of [[North India]] from 180&amp;nbsp;BC, whence they are known as the Indo-Greeks. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until AD&amp;nbsp;10.

Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]] (185–73&amp;nbsp;BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. [[Zarmanochegas]] was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] traveled to [[Antioch]] and [[Athens]] while [[Augustus]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coinage====
The coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 160–135&amp;nbsp;BC), found from [[Afghanistan]] to central India, bear the inscription "Saviour King Menander" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[Strato I]], [[Heliokles II]], [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Menander II]] and [[Archebius]] display on their coins the title "Maharajasa Dharmika" (lit. "King of the Dharma") in [[Prakrit]] written in [[Kharoshthi]].

Some of the coins of Menander I and [[Menander II]] incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. According to the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]], at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist [[arhat]],&lt;ref&gt;Extract of the [[Milinda Panha]]: "And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to [[Arhat|Arahatship]]!" ([[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]], Translation by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]], 1890)&lt;/ref&gt; a fact also echoed by [[Plutarch]], who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch on Menander: "But when one Menander, who had reigned graciously over the Bactrians, died afterwards in the camp, the cities indeed by common consent celebrated his funerals; but coming to a contest about his relics, they were difficultly at last brought to this agreement, that his ashes being distributed, everyone should carry away an equal share, and they should all erect monuments to him." (Plutarch, "Political Precepts" Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6) p147–148 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090138/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Plutarch0206/Morals/0062-05_Bk.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenanderChakra.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A coin of [[Menander I]] (r.160–135 BC) with a [[dharmacakra]] and a palm.]]

The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of [[Antialcidas]] and [[Menander II]], where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.

Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as [[Amyntas Nikator]], [[Nicias (Indo-Greek king)|Nicias]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Hermaeus]], [[Hippostratos]] and [[Menander II]], depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka [[mudra]] (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching.

====Cities====
According to [[Ptolemy]], Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern [[India]]. Menander established his capital in [[Sagala]] (modern [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]) one of the centers of the blossoming [[Buddhist culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milinda Panha]], Chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; A large Greek city built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of [[Sirkap]] near [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], where Buddhist [[stupa]]s were standing side-by-side with [[Hindu]] and [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temples]], indicating religious tolerance and syncretism.

====Scriptures====
Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the ''[[Milinda Pañha]]'' or "Questions of Menander", a Pali-language discourse in the [[Platonism|Platonic style]] held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk [[Nagasena]].

[[File:Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba.jpg|thumb|According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]], was dedicated by a 30,000-strong [[Yona]] delegation from [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]] around 130&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', chapter 29, records that during Menander's reign, a Greek ''thera'' (elder monk) named ''[[Mahadharmaraksita]]'' led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alexandria" (possibly [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of today's [[Kabul]] in Afghanistan), to [[Sri Lanka]] for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander's territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it.&lt;ref name="McEvilley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas  McEvilley|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbjelOMYyN8C&amp;pg=PT558|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|isbn=978-1-58115-933-2|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek [[meridarch]] (civil governor of a province) named [[Theodorus (meridarch)|Theodorus]], describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined [[śarīra|relics of the Buddha]]. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="Tarn2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarn|first=William Woodthorpe|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00941-6|page=391|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and [[Kanishka the Great]].

Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the [[Mahayana]] figure of "[[Avalokiteśvara|Lokesvara]]raja Buddha" ({{lang|grc|λωγοασφαροραζοβοδδο}}). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sims-Williams, "A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The [[Kushan Empire]], one of the five tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], settled in [[Bactria]] around 125&amp;nbsp;BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around AD&amp;nbsp;1. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their [[coin]]s and their adoption of the [[Greek alphabet]].

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, [[amphora]]s, wine and music. Detail from [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.]]
The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the [[Fourth Buddhist council]] around 100 in [[Kashmir]] in order to redact the [[Sarvastivada#Canon|Sarvastivadin canon]]. Some of Kanishka's coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word "Boddo" in Greek script.

Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] translated into [[Sanskrit]], "a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kanishka casket]], dated to the first year of Kanishka's reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's stupas ([[cetiya]]), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date.

==Philosophical influences==
Several philosophers, including [[Pyrrho]], [[Anaxarchus]] and [[Onesicritus]], are said to have accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian ascetics, generally described as [[Gymnosophists]] ("naked philosophers").

Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], the first Western school of [[skepticism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.&lt;ref&gt;"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], is said by [[Strabo]] to have learnt in India the following precepts: "That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief".&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"&gt;Strabo, XV.I.65: {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23119 |title=Strabo XV.1 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where [[Magas of Cyrene]] ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influences==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Numerous works of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as [[Gandhara]]. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of [[Western Asia]]tic or Hellenistic origin.

===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha===
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|upright|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century AD, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district]], [[India]].]]
Although there is still some debate, the first [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was "[[aniconism|aniconic]]": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).

This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.&lt;ref&gt;"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time". Also "''Hinayanis'' opposed image worship of the Master due to canonical restrictions".   R.C. Sharma, in "The Art of Mathura, India", Tokyo National Museum 2002, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of "their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;Linssen, "[[Zen]] Living"&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=June 2014}} In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop [[syncretic]] divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is [[Serapis]], introduced by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] in [[Egypt]], who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

}}
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&amp;nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]]. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the [[Pāli canon]]; we find the same description in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience:
{{quote|One of the distinguishing features of the Gandharan school of art that emerged in north-west India is that it has been clearly influenced by the naturalism of the Classical Greek style. Thus, while these images still convey the inner peace that results from putting the Buddha's doctrine into practice, they also give us an impression of people who walked and talked, etc. and slept much as we do. I feel this is very important. These figures are inspiring because they do not only depict the goal, but also the sense that people like us can achieve it if we try.|[[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;[[14th Dalai Lama]], foreword to "Echoes of Alexander the Great", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements.

===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon===

[[File:Coin of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|left|A Buddhist coin of [[Kanishka I]], with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ "Boddo" (=the [[Buddha]]) in Greek script on the reverse.]]
Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, [[Heracles]] with a lion-skin, the protector deity of [[Demetrius I of Bactria]], "served as an artistic model for [[Vajrapani]], a protector of the Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; (See&lt;ref&gt;Images of the Herakles-influenced Vajrapani: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131216205740/http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image 1], [http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg Image 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040313155937/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg |date=2004-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Japan]], this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular [[Nio|Niō]] guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese [[Fūjin]], inspired from the Greek divinity [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]], or the mother deity [[Hariti]] inspired by [[Tyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsumi Tanabe, ''Alexander the Great: East-West Cultural Contact from Greece to Japan'' (Tokyo: NHK Puromōshon and Tokyo National Museum, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, forms such as [[garland]]-bearing [[cherub]]s, [[vine]] [[scroll]]s, and such semi-human creatures as the [[centaur]] and [[Triton (mythology)|triton]], are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court.

===Gandharan proselytism in the East===

[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Blue-eyed [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]]n monk teaching East-Asian monk. A fresco from the  [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]], dated to the 9th or 10th century ([[Kara-Khoja Kingdom]]).]]

Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "Milinda"),  [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was "a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: [[Yona]], lit. [[Ionia]]n) Buddhist head monk," according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&amp;nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]]. [[Dharmaraksita]] ([[Sanskrit]]), or Dhammarakkhita ([[Pāli|Pali]]) ([[translation]]: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "[[Yona]]", lit. "[[Ionia]]n") in the [[Mahavamsa]], and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, [[Menander I]] was famously converted to Buddhism by [[Nagasena]], who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Dharmaraksita]]. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an [[arhat]] under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I ([[Pāli|Pali]] "Milinda") with the monk [[Nagasena]] comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the [[Milinda Panha]].

Buddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] in Afghanistan, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist [[Kushan]] monks such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] ({{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;178}}) travelled to the Chinese capital of [[Loyang]], where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz|Foltz, Richard]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 46 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]] frescos from the [[Tarim Basin]]. In legend too [[Bodhidharma]], the founder of [[Chán]]-Buddhism, which later became [[Zen]], and the legendary originator of the physical training of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], is described as a Buddhist monk from [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547).&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" ({{zh|c=碧眼胡|p=Bìyǎn hú|labels=no}}) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 485 AD, according to the 7th century Chinese historic treatise [[Liang Shu]], five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of [[Fusang]] ("The country of the extreme East" beyond the sea, probably eastern [[Japan]]), where they introduced Buddhism:

{{quote|"[[Fusang]] is located to the east of China, 20,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' [1,500&amp;nbsp;km] east of the state of ''Da Han'' (itself east of the state of ''Wa'' in modern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]). (...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the [[Song dynasty]] [AD&amp;nbsp;485], five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result the customs of Fusang changed." (Chinese: "{{lang|zh|扶桑在大漢國東二萬餘里,地在中國之東(...)其俗舊無佛法,宋大明二年,罽賓國嘗有比丘五人游行至其國,流通佛法,經像,教令出家,風 俗遂改.}}")}}

Two half-brothers from [[Gandhara]], [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century), created the [[Yogacara]] or "Mind-only" school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy.

===Greco-Buddhism in the West===
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka. This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the [[Silk Road]] is confirmed by the Roman craze for [[silk]] from the 1st century BC to the point that the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: [[Strabo]] (64/63&amp;nbsp;BC – {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;24}}), [[Seneca the Younger]] ({{circa|3&amp;nbsp;BC}} – AD&amp;nbsp;65), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD&amp;nbsp;23–79). The aforementioned Strabo and [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|45}}–125) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king [[Milinda|Menander]], confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.

[[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] while Augustus (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death.&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"/&gt; His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. [[Plutarch]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;120) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of [[Calanus of India]] ([[Kalanos]]) witnessed by Alexander writes: "The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you 'the Indian's Monument,'"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. 'Life of Alexander' in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans. (trans John Dryden and revised Arthur Hugh Clough) The Modern Library (Random House Inc). New York.p850&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Zarmanochegas' tomb in Roman Athens.

Another century later the Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died 215) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): "The Indian [[gymnosophists]] are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called "Hylobii" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of [[Buddha]] (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours."&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Clement of Alexandria Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria in Egypt, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria at this time is important, since "It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Linssen]], ''Zen living''&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word "[[Theravada|Theravāda]],"&lt;ref&gt;According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy&lt;/ref&gt; a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism".&lt;ref&gt;"Zen living", [[Robert Linssen]]{{Page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have been descendants of [[Asoka]]'s emissaries to the West.&lt;ref&gt;"The Original Jesus" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Christianity===
{{Main|Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhist influences on Christianity}}
[[File:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|Queen Māyā's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2nd–3rd century AD.]]

Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.

One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.&lt;ref&gt;"Certain Indian notions may have made their way westward into the budding Christianity of the Mediterranean world through the channels of the Greek diaspora."  Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Scholars have often considered the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity. They have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus" (Bentley, ''Old World Encounters'').}}

The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century AD) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says "was born from the side of a virgin,"&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential early Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV).&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; The legend of Christian saints [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] draws on the life of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], '''human mating strategies''' are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).

Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, B.S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=%22Ecological+and+socio-cultural+impacts+on+mating+and+marriage%22&amp;ots=G2likE1yj4&amp;sig=S-4V07k_fpqAmjrzHf5IwSi2i1U#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22&amp;f=false "Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage"]. ''Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'', 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).

==Flirting==
{{main|Flirting}}
To bond or express sexual interest, people flirt. [[Kate Fox]], a social [[anthropologist]], posits two main types of flirting: flirting for fun and flirting with intent. Flirting for fun can take place between friends, co-workers, or total strangers that wish to get to know each other. This type of flirting does not seek sexual intercourse or romantic relationship, but increases the bonds between two people.

Flirting with intent plays a role in mate-selection. The person flirting sends out signals of sexual availability to another, and hopes to see the interest returned to encourage continued flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, hair-touching, or verbal signs, such as chatting up, flattering comments, and exchange of telephone numbers to enable further contact.

==Dating==
{{main|Dating}}
People date to assess each other's suitability as a partner in an [[intimate relationship]] or as a [[Marriage|spouse]]. Dating rules may vary across different cultures, and some societies may even replace the dating process by a [[courtship]] instead.

==Matchmaking==
{{main|Matchmaking}}
{{see also|Arranged marriage|Forced marriage}}
In many cultural traditions, a date may be arranged by a third party, who may be a family member, acquaintance, or professional [[matchmaking|matchmaker]]. In some cultures, a marriage may be [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by the couple's parents or an outside party. Recently, [[internet dating]] has become popular.

== Theoretical background ==
Research on human mating strategies is guided by the [[Sexual selection|theory of sexual selection]], and in particular, [[Robert Trivers]]' concept of [[parental investment]]. Trivers defines parental investment as “any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence [[reproductive success]]) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.” Trivers posited that differential parental investment between males and females drives the process of sexual selection, which leads to the evolution of [[sexual dimorphism]] in [[mate choice]], competitive ability, and [[courtship display]]s (see also [[secondary sex characteristics]]). In humans, females make a larger parental investment than males (i.e. nine months of [[gestation]] followed by childbirth and [[lactation]]). While human males invest heavily in their offspring as well, their minimum parental investment is still lower than that of females. Hence, evolutionary psychologists have predicted a number of sex differences in human mating strategies.

== Gender differences ==

=== Sexual desire ===
One theory states that because of their lower minimum parental investment, men can achieve greater [[reproductive success]] by mating with multiple women than women can achieve by mating with multiple men.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Evolutionary psychologists therefore argue that ancestral men who possessed a desire for multiple short-term sex partners, to the extent that they were capable of attracting them, would have left more descendants than men without such a desire. Ancestral women, by contrast, would have maximized reproductive success not by mating with as many men as possible, but by selectively mating with those men who were most able and willing to invest resources in their offspring. Gradually in a bid to compete to get resources from potential men, women have evolved to show [[Extended female sexuality|extended sexuality]]. One classic study found that when college students were approached on campus by opposite-sex confederates and asked if they wanted to "go to bed" with him/her, 75% of the men said yes while 0% percent of the women said yes.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R.D., &amp; Hatfield, E.

Evolutionary research often indicates that men have a strong desire for casual sex, unlike women. Men are often depicted as wanting numerous female sexual partners to maximise reproductive success.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt; Evolutionary mechanisms for short-term mating are evident today. Mate-guarding behaviours and sexual jealousy point to an evolutionary history in which sexual relations with multiple partners became a recurrent adaptive problem,&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M., &amp; Shackelford, T.K.

''Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality'', 2, 39–55.&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of extramarital affairs in similar frequencies cross-culturally, are evidence of an ancestral past in which [[polygamy|polygamous]] mating strategies were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (1994). "Individual differences in mating strategies". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 17, 581–582.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, journalist Daniel Bergner, who dismisses evolutionary biology,  argues that monogamy has been used to control human female sexual behavior and that the human female sex drive is not lower than the human male sex drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Emily Esfahani |title=How Strong Is the Female Sex Drive After All? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/07/how-strong-is-the-female-sex-drive-after-all/277429/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanagan and Cardwell argue&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=Cara|title=A2 student book for AQA A psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199129843|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; that men could not pursue this ideology, without willing female partners. Every time a man has a new sexual partner, the woman also has a new sexual partner. It has been proposed, therefore, that casual sex and numerous sexual partners may also confer some benefit to females. That is, they would produce more genetically diverse offspring as a result, which would increase their chances of successfully rearing children to adolescence, or independence.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;

=== Sexual attractions ===
Evolutionary psychologists have predicted that men generally place a [[Mate value in humans|greater value]] on youth and physical attractiveness in a mate than do women. Youth is associated with [[Reproductive value (population genetics)|reproductive value]] in women, and features that men find physically attractive in women are thought to signal health and [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M., &amp; Schmitt, D.P. (1993). [https://www.academia.edu/download/1616706/sexual_strategies_theory_1993.pdf "Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating"]. ''Psychological Review'', 100(2), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who preferentially mated with healthy, fertile, and reproductively valuable women would have left more descendants than men who did not. Since men’s reproductive value does not decline as steeply with age as does women’s, women are not expected to exhibit as strong of a preference for youth in a mate. Evolutionary psychologists have also speculated that women are relatively more attracted to ambition and social status in a mate because they associate these characteristics with men’s access to resources. Women who preferentially mated with men capable of investing resources in their offspring, thereby ensuring their offsprings' survival, would have left more descendants than women who did not. Evolutionary psychologists have tested these predictions across cultures, confirming that men tend to report a greater preference for youth and physical attractiveness in a mate than do women, and that women tend to report a greater preference for ambition and social status in a mate than do men.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M.

For example, as women gain more access to resources their mate preferences change. Finding a mate with resources becomes less of a priority and a mate with domestic skills is more important. As women’s access to resources varies between cultures, so does mate preference.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S.W., Haselton, M.G., &amp; Buss, D.M. (2006).

== Individual differences ==

=== Sociosexual Orientation Inventory ===
Average differences in mating strategies between the sexes do not entail uniformity in mating strategies within the sexes, and in humans, such within-sex variation is substantial.&lt;ref name="Gangestad, S. W. 2000"&gt;Gangestad, S.W., &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2000).

''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 23(04), 573–587.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences in mating strategies are commonly measured using the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI), a questionnaire that includes items assessing past sexual behavior, anticipated future sexual behavior, and openness to casual sex.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.A., &amp; Gangestad, S.W. (1991).

''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 60(6), 870.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher scores on the SOI indicate a ''sexually unrestricted'' mating strategy, and lower scores on the SOI indicate a ''sexually restricted'' mating strategy. Several studies have found that scores on the SOI are related to mate preferences, with more sexually restricted individuals preferring personal/parenting qualities in a mate (e.g. responsibility and loyalty), and with less sexual restricted individual preferring qualities related to physical attractiveness and social visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.A. &amp; Gangestad, S.W.

''Evolution and Human Behavior'', 28(5), 359–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short-term vs. long-term mating ===
Evolutionary psychologists have proposed that individuals may adopt conditional mating strategies in which they adjust their mating tactics to relevant environmental or internal conditions.&lt;ref name="Gangestad, S. W. 2000"/&gt; To the extent that ancestral men were capable of pursuing short-term mating strategies with multiple women, the evolutionary benefits are relatively straightforward. Less clear, however, are the evolutionary benefits that women might have received from pursuing short-term mating strategies. However, women in a stressed situation may benefit from protection from a male and short term mating is a way to achieve this as is seen in contemporary asylum seeker anthropological studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2017/10/31/why-so-many-migrant-mothers-arrive-in-europe-pregnant | title=Why So Many Migrant Mothers Arrive in Europe Pregnant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One prominent hypothesis is that ancestral women selectively engaged in short-term mating with men capable of transmitting genetic benefits to their offspring such as health, disease resistance, or attractiveness (see [[Sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes theory]] and [[sexy son hypothesis]]). Since women cannot inspect men's genes directly, they may have evolved to infer genetic quality from certain observable characteristics (see [[Mate choice#Indicator traits|indicator traits]]). One prominent candidate for a "good genes" indicator includes fluctuating asymmetry, or the degree to which men deviate from perfect bodily symmetry. Other candidates include masculine facial features,&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S.W., &amp; Thornhill, R. (2003). "Facial masculinity and fluctuating asymmetry". ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', 24(4), 231–241.&lt;/ref&gt; behavioral dominance,&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.A., Gangestad, S.W., Christensen, P.N., &amp; Leck, K. (1999).

''Evolution and Human Behavior'', 27(4), 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary psychologists have therefore indicated that women pursuing a short-term mating strategy have higher preferences for these good gene indicators, and men who possess good genes indicators are more successful in pursuing short-term mating strategies than men who do not. Indeed, research indicates that self-perceived physical attractiveness,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A.P. (2006).

''Biology Letters'', 3(6), 682–684.&lt;/ref&gt; are positively related to short-term mating success in men but not in women. Women prefer purported good genes indicators more for a short-term mate than for a long-term mate, and a related line of research, known as the [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]], shows that women’s preferences for good genes indicators in short-term mates tends to increase during peak fertility in the [[menstrual cycle]] just prior to [[ovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, K., Haselton, M.G., &amp; Fales, M.

=== Mating strategy plasticity ===
Research on the conditional nature of mating strategies has revealed that long-term and short-term mating preferences can be fairly plastic. Following exposure to cues that would have been affected mating in the ancestral past, both men and women appear to adjust their mating preferences in ways that would have historically enhanced their fitness. Such cues include the need to care for young, danger from animals and other humans, and resource availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Andrew G.|last2=Stewart-Williams|first2=Steve|title=Mating strategy flexibility in the laboratory: Preferences for long- and short-term mating change in response to evolutionarily relevant variables|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S109051381730017X|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=39|issue=1|pages=82–93|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.10.004|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental predictors ==
In 2005, the evolutionary psychologist David Schmitt conducted a multinational survey of sexual attitudes and behaviors involving 48 countries called the International Sexual Description Project (ISSR).&lt;ref name=sociosexualityaz /&gt; Schmitt assessed relationships between several societal-level variables and average scores on the SOI. One variable that was shown to significantly predict a nation’s average SOI score was the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), which was defined by Schmitt as “the relative balance of marriage-age men versus marriage-age women in the local mating pool.” When one sex is scarce relative to the other sex, the less-scarce sex may compete more intensely for access to the scarcer sex. One way in which the more numerous sex might compete is by displaying the attributes that are most desired by the scarcer sex. Since men have a greater desire for casual sex (see above), societies with more women relative to men were predicted to exhibit higher scores on the SOI than societies with more balanced or male-biased sex ratios. This prediction was confirmed: OSR was significantly positively correlated with national SOI scores.&lt;ref name=sociosexualityaz /&gt; Another variable that Schmitt predicted would influence SOI scores was the need for biparental care. In societies where extensive care from both parents is needed to ensure offspring survival, the costs of having sex with an uncommitted partner are much higher. Schmitt found significant negative correlations between several indices of need for biparental care (e.g. infant mortality, child malnutrition, and low birth-weight infants) and national SOI scores.

Another important societal variable for mating strategies is the threat of infectious disease or ''pathogen prevalence''. Since physical attractiveness is thought to signal health and disease resistance, evolutionary psychologists have predicted that, in societies high in pathogen prevalence, people value attractiveness more in a mate. Indeed, research has confirmed that pathogen prevalence is associated with preferences for attractiveness across nations.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S.W., &amp; Buss, D.M. (1993). [https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/30928/0000598.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y "Pathogen prevalence and human mate preferences"]. ''Ethology and Sociobiology'', 14(2), 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in nations with high pathogen prevalence also show greater preferences for facial masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;DeBruine, L.M., Jones, B.C., Crawford, J.R., Welling, L.L., &amp; Little, A.C. (2010). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894896/ "The health of a nation predicts their mate preferences: cross-cultural variation in women's preferences for masculinized male faces"]. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', 277(1692), 2405–2410.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also reasoned that sexual contact with multiple individuals increases the risk of disease transmission, thereby increasing the costs of pursuing a short-term mating strategy. Consistent with this reasoning, higher pathogen prevalence is associated with lower national SOI scores.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, M., &amp; Murray, D.R. (2008). [https://www.academia.edu/download/1878597/SchallerMurray2008.pdf "Pathogens, personality, and culture: disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience"]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 95(1), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, several studies have found that experimentally manipulating disease salience has a causal influence on attractiveness preferences and SOI scores in predicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D.R., Jones, D.N., &amp; Schaller, M. (2012). [http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/MurrayJonesSchaller2013.pdf "Perceived threat of infectious disease and its implications for sexual attitudes"].

''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', 278(1714), 2032–2039.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political attitudes ==
Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that mating strategies can influence political attitudes. According to this perspective, different mating strategies are in direct strategic conflict. For instance, the stability of long-term partnerships may be threatened by the availability of short-term sexual opportunities. Therefore, public policy measures that impose costs on casual sex may benefit people pursuing long-term mating strategies by reducing the availability of short-term mating opportunities outside of committed relationships. One public policy measure that imposes costs on people pursuing short-term mating strategies, and may thereby appeal to sexually restricted individuals, is the banning of abortion. In an influential doctoral dissertation, the psychologist Jason Weeden conducted statistical analyses on public and undergraduate datasets supporting the hypothesis that attitudes towards abortion are more strongly predicted by mating-relevant variables than by variables related to views on the [[sanctity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Weeden, J. (2003). ''Genetic interests, life histories, and attitudes towards abortion''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeden and colleagues have also argued that attitudes towards drug legalization are driven by individual differences in mating strategies. Insofar as sexually restricted individuals associate recreational drug use with promiscuity, they may be motivated to oppose drug legalization. Consistent with this, one study found that the strongest predictor of attitudes towards drug legalization was scores on the SOI.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzban, R., Dukes, A., &amp; Weeden, J. (2010). [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1699/3501.full.pdf+html "Sex, drugs and moral goals: reproductive strategies and views about recreational drugs"]. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', 277(1699), 3501–3508.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship remained strong even when controlling for personality traits, political orientation, and moral values. By contrast, nonsexual variables typically associated with attitudes towards drug legalization were strongly attenuated or eliminated when controlling for SOI and other sexuality-related measures. These findings were replicated in Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Quintelier, K.J., Ishii, K., Weeden, J., Kurzban, R., &amp; Braeckman, J. (2013).

''Human Nature'', 24(2), 196–217.&lt;/ref&gt; Weeden and colleagues have made similar arguments and have conducted similar analyses in regard to religiosity; that is, religious institutions may function to facilitate high-fertility, sexually restricted mating and reproductive strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Weeden, J., Cohen, A.B., &amp; Kenrick, D.T.

An '''in-joke''', also known as an '''inside joke''' or a '''private joke''', is a [[joke]] whose [[humour]] is understandable only to members of an [[ingroup]], that is, people who are ''in'' a particular social group, occupation, or other community of shared interest. It is an [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] joke that is humorous only to those who are aware of the circumstances behind it.

In-jokes may exist within a small social clique, such as a group of friends, or extend to an entire profession such as the [[film]] or [[professional wrestling]] industries, or a particular sporting field or chess team.  Ethnic or religious groups usually have their own in-jokes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/tm_headline=are-the-welsh-really-funny-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=17932085&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html Wales Online: "Are the Welsh Really Funny?", 14 October 2006.  Retrieved 6 September 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In-jokes are cryptic allusions to shared [[common ground (communication technique)|common ground]] that act as triggers; only those who have shared the common ground provide an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication and Group Decision Making|author=Randy Y. Hirokawa and [[Marshall Scott Poole]]|pages=96|year=1996|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=076190462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An in-joke works to build community, sometimes at the expense of outsiders. Part of the power of an in-joke is that its audience knows that there are those who do not understand the joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Rides the Beast?: Prophetic Rivalry and the Rhetoric of Crisis in the Churches of the Apocalypse|author=Paul Brooks Duff|pages=81|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019513835X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-joke can also be used as a [[subtext]], where people in the know may find humour in something not explicitly spoken. They may even apologize for doing so to a [[rookie]], directly or indirectly stating that what they were laughing at was an in-joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Acting Your Dreams: Use Acting Techniques to Interpret Your Dreams|author=Ben Tousey|pages=118&amp;ndash;119|year=2003|publisher=Ben Tousey|isbn=1-4140-0542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer industry==
In the computer industry some computer programmers hide in-jokes within the code of [[software]] in the form of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]]s, i.e., hidden content that can be revealed only by following a specific sequence of inputs. Easter eggs is a way for software developers to put their "signature" on the program, especially in video games, originally during times when they received little or no credit from their employer for their work.

The ''[[Jargon File]]'' is a [[glossary]] of [[Hacking (innovation)|hacker]] [[slang]], much of which is in-jokes or is based on in-jokes.

'''Industrial and organizational psychology''' ('''I/O psychology'''), which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work and organizational psychology, is an applied discipline within [[psychology]]. I/O psychology is the science of human behaviour relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Truxillo, D. M., Bauer, T. N., &amp; Erdogan, B. (2016).  Psychology and Work:  Perspectives on Industrial and Organizational Psychology.  New York:  Psychology Press-Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O [[psychologist]]s are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, [[motivation]], [[job satisfaction]], and [[occupational safety and health]] as well as the overall [[health]] and [[well-being]] of its employees.  An I/O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviours and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Better Organizations'' Brochure published by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Retrieved from [http://www.siop.org/visibilitybrochure/memberbrochure.aspx SIOP.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, I/O psychology is one of the 16 recognized specialties by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/recognized.aspx |title=Recognized Specialties and Proficiencies in Professional Psychology |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=American Psychological Association |publisher=American Psychological Association |access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented by Division 14 of the APA, and was formally known as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]] (SIOP). In the United Kingdom, industrial and organizational psychologists are referred to as occupational psychologists. Occupational psychology in the UK is one of nine 'protected titles' within the profession "practitioner psychologist" regulated by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/ HPC – Health Professions Council – Protected titles]. Hpc-uk.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, graduate programs in psychology, including occupational psychology, are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]].

In Australia, the title organizational psychologist is protected by law, and regulated by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Organizational psychology is one of nine areas of specialist endorsement for psychology practice in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx |title=Psychology Board of Australia – Endorsement |publisher=Psychologyboard.gov.au |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe someone with a specialist [[EuroPsy]] Certificate in Work and Organisational Psychology is a fully qualified psychologist and an expert in the work psychology field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europsy-efpa.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial and organizational psychologists reaching the EuroPsy standard are recorded in the Register of European Psychologists and industrial and organizational psychology is one of the three main psychology specializations in Europe.

==Historical overview==
The historical development of I/O psychology was paralleled in the US, the UK,&lt;ref&gt;Chimiel, N. (2000). History and context for work and organizational psychology. In N. Chmiel (Ed.), ''Introduction to work and organizational psychology :A European perspective''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, Germany, the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Shimmin, S., &amp; van Strien, P. J. (1998). History of the psychology of work and organization. In P. J. D. Drenth, H. Thierry, &amp; C. J. de Wolff (Eds.), ''Handbook of work and organizational psychology'' (pp. 71–99). Hove, U.K.: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and eastern European countries such as Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Pitariu, H. D. (19912). I/O psychology in Romania: Past, present and intentions. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, 29''(4), 29–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of I/O psychology trace back nearly to the beginning of psychology as a science, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded one of the first psychological laboratories in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. In the mid 1880s, Wundt trained two psychologists, [[Hugo Münsterberg]] and [[James McKeen Cattell]], who had a major influence on the emergence of I/O psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, F. J. (1997). Early influences on the development of industrial and organizational psychology. Journal of Applied Psychology, 82, 467–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of viewing performance differences as human "errors", Cattell was one of the first to recognize the importance of differences among individuals as a way of better understanding work behavior. [[Walter Dill Scott]], who was a contemporary of Cattell, was elected President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1919, was arguably the most prominent I/O psychologist of his time. Scott, along with [[Walter Van Dyke Bingham]], worked at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]], developing methods for selecting and training sales personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feruson, L. (1965). ''The heritage of industrial psychology''. Hartford, CT: Finlay Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "industrial" side of I/O psychology originated in research on individual differences, [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|assessment]], and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I, in response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the [[Stanford–Binet]], which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the [[Army Alpha]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the War, the growing industrial base in the US was a source of momentum for what was then called industrial psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Private industry set out to emulate the successful testing of army personnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Mental ability testing soon became commonplace in the work setting.

[[Elton Mayo]] found that rest periods improved morale and reduced turnover in a Philadelphia textile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1924). Recovery and industrial fatigue. ''Journal of Personnel Research, 3'', 273–281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin,  M.  A., Landy,  F.  J., &amp; Mayocchi, L. (2002). Australian influences on Elton Mayo: The construct of revery in industrial society. ''History of Psychology, 5''(4), 356–375.&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the ongoing [[Hawthorne studies]], where he became interested in how workers' emotions and informal relationships affected productivity. The results of these studies ushered in the [[human relations movement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[World War II]] brought renewed interest in ability testing (to accurately place recruits in new technologically advanced military jobs), the introduction of the assessment center, and concern with morale and fatigue in war industry workers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The industrial psychology division of the former American Association of Applied Psychology became a division within APA,&lt;ref name="Kopes"&gt;Kopes, L. L. (2006). A brief history of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Accessed June 3, 2013. [http://www.siop.org/History/History.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming Division 14 of APA. It was initially called the Industrial and Business Psychology Division. In 1962, the name was changed to the Industrial Psychology Division. In 1973, it was renamed again, this time to the Division of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In 1982, the unit become more independent of APA, and its name was changed again, this time to the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt;

The name change of the division from "industrial psychology" to "industrial and organizational psychology" reflected the shift in the work of industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study.&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt; The emphasis on "organizational" underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common [[goal]] and a common set of operating procedures.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I/O psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

According to Bryan and Vinchur, "while organizational psychology increased in popularity through [the 1960s and 1970s], research and practice in the traditional areas of industrial psychology continued, primarily driven by employment legislation and case law" (p.&amp;nbsp;53).&lt;ref name = "Bryan"&gt;Bryan, L. L. K., &amp; Vinchur, A.J. (2012). A history of industrial and organizational psychology. S. W. J. Kozlowski (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of organizational psychology'' (pp. 22-75). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a focus on fairness and validity in selection efforts as well as in the job analyses that undergirded selection instruments. For example, i/o psychology showed increased interest in [[behaviorally anchored rating scales]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; What critics there were of i/o psychology accused the discipline of being responsive only to the concerns of managements.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

From the 1980 to 2010s other changes in i/o psychology took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena from both the level of the organization and the level of the individual worker.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Methodological innovations (e.g., [[meta-analyses]], [[structural equation modeling]]) were adopted. With the passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|American with Disabilities Act]] in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, i/o psychology saw an increased emphasis on "fairness in personnel decisions."&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Training research relied increasingly on advances in [[educational psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

==Research methods==

As described above, I/O psychologists are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. I/O psychologists rely on a variety of methods to conduct organizational research. Study designs employed by I/O psychologists include [[statistical survey|surveys]], [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], and [[observational studies]]. I/O psychologists rely on diverse data sources including human judgments, historical databases, objective measures of work performance (e.g., sales volume), and questionnaires and surveys.

I/O researchers employ quantitative statistical methods. [[Quantitative methods]] used in I/O psychology include [[correlation]], [[multiple regression]], and [[analysis of variance]]. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;Hayduk, L.A. (1987). ''Structural equations modeling with LISREL.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hierarchical linear modeling]] (HLM; also known as [[multilevel modeling]]).&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S.W. &amp; Bryk, A.S. (2001). ''Hierarchical linear models: Applications and data analysis methods'' (2nd ed.). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has also employed [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1990). ''Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings.'' Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1994). Estimation of sampling error variance in the meta-analysis of correlations: Use of average correlation in the homogeneous case. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 79, 171–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, R. &amp; DiMatteo, M.R. (2002). Meta-analysis. In H. Pashler &amp; J. Wixted (Eds.). ''Stevens' handbook of experimental psychology'' (3rd ed.), Vol. 4: Methodology in experimental psychology, pp. 391–428. Hoboken, NJ, US: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists also employ [[psychometric]] methods including methods associated with [[classical test theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994). ''Psychometric theory'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalizability theory]], and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit, M. (2003) ''IRT from SSI.'' Mooresville, IN: Scientific Software.&lt;/ref&gt;

I/O psychologists have also employed [[qualitative methods]], which largely involve [[focus groups]], [[interviews]], and [[case studies]]. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed [[ethnographic]] techniques and [[participant observation]]. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's [[Critical Incident Technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, J.C. (1954). The Critical Incident Technique. ''Psychological Bulletin, 51'', 327–58.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists sometimes use quantitative and qualitative methods in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Rogelberg, S. G., &amp; Brooks-Laber, M. E. (2002). Securing our collective duture: Challenges facing those designing and doing research in industrial and organization psychology. In S. G. Rogelberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of research methods in industrial and organizational psychology'' (pp. 479 – 485). Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.&lt;ref&gt;Elfering, A., Grebner, S., Semmer, N.K., Kaiser-Freiburghaus, D., Lauper-Del Ponte, S., &amp; Witschi, I. (2005). Chronic job stressors and job control: Effects on event-related coping success and well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 78'', 237–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics{{anchor|Topics in industrial-organizational psychology}}==

===Job analysis===
{{main|Job analysis}}
Job analysis encompasses a number of different methods.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} It primarily involves the systematic collection of information about a job. A task-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the duties, tasks, and/or competencies required by the job being assessed. By contrast, a worker-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required to successfully perform the work. Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, [[performance appraisals]] and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.

===Personnel recruitment and selection===
{{main|Personnel selection}}
I/O psychologists typically work with human resource specialists to design (a) recruitment processes and (b) personnel selection systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Personnel [[recruitment]] is the process of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce and getting them to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.

Personnel selection is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common selection tools include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, [[personality tests]], structured [[interviews]], the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples. I/O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance.

Personnel selection procedures are usually validated, i.e., shown to be job relevant to personnel selection, using one or more of the following types of validity: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]]. I/O psychologists must adhere to professional standards in personnel selection efforts. SIOP (e.g., ''Principles for validation and use of personnel selection procedures''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siop.org/_Principles/principles.pdf ''The SIOP principles'']&lt;/ref&gt;) and APA together with the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (e.g., ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''&lt;ref&gt;[''The standards for educational and psychological testing'' http://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; are sources of those standards. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s ''Uniform guidelines''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniformguidelines.com/ ''Uniform guidelines on eemployee selection procedures'']&lt;/ref&gt; are also influential in guiding personnel selection decisions.

A meta-analysis of selection methods found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of job performance and attainment in training.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F.L., &amp; Hunter, J.E. (1998). The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings. ''Psychological Bulletin, 124''(2), 262–74. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance appraisal/management===
{{main|Performance appraisal|Performance management}}
Performance appraisal or [[performance evaluation]] is the process in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (1992). ''Industrial-organizational psychology.'' New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management is the process of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.

An I/O psychologist would typically use information from the job analysis to determine a job's performance dimensions, and then construct a [[rating scale]] to describe each level of performance for the job.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Often, the I/O psychologist would be responsible for training organizational personnel how to use the performance appraisal instrument, including ways to minimize bias when using the rating scale, and how to provide effective performance feedback.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Individual assessment and psychometrics===
{{main|Individual assessment|Psychometrics}}
[[Individual assessment]] involves the measurement of [[individual differences]]. I/O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees.&lt;ref name="A and U"&gt;Anastasi, A., &amp; Urbina, S. (1997). ''Psychological testing. 7th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, individual assessment is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, [[personality test]]s, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, [[simulation]]s, and [[assessment centre]]s.&lt;ref name="A and U"/&gt;

===Occupational health and well-being===

I/O psychologists are concerned with occupational health and [[well-being]]. Early in the 20th century [[Arthur Kornhauser]] examined the impact on productivity of hiring mentally unstable workers.&lt;ref name="Zickar"&gt;Zickar, M. J. (2003). Remembering Arthur Kornhauser: Industrial psychology’s advocate for worker well-being. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 363–369. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.363&lt;/ref&gt; Kornhauser also examined the link between industrial working conditions and mental health as well as the spillover into a worker's personal life of having an unsatisfying job.&lt;ref&gt;Kornhauser, A. (1965). ''Mental health of the industrial worker''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between [[job satisfaction]] and subjective well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83''(4), 915–934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liljegren, M. 2009"&gt;Liljegren, M., &amp; Ekberg, K. (2009). Job mobility as predictor of health and burnout. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 82''(2), 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, I/O researchers have found that staying vigorous during working hours is associated with better work-related behaviour and subjective well-being as well as more effective functioning in the family domain.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"&gt;Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). Staying vigorous until work is over: The role of trait vigour, day-specific work experiences and recovery. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81''(3), 435–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Trait vigor and recovery experiences after work were related to vigor at work.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"/&gt; Job satisfaction has also been found to be associated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, well-being and positive affect, and the absence of [[negative affect]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"/&gt;  Other research indicates that among older workers activities such as volunteering and participating in social clubs was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Potočnik, K., &amp; Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). A longitudinal study of well-being in older workers and retirees: The role of engaging in different types of activities. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 89'', 497–521. doi:10.1111/joop.12003&lt;/ref&gt; Research on job changing indicates that mobility between, but not within, organizations is associated with [[occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref name="Liljegren, M. 2009"/&gt;

===Workplace bullying, aggression and violence===
{{main|Workplace bullying|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}} 
I/O psychologists are concerned with the related topics of workplace bullying, aggression, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, I., Garvin, F. (2013). Employee relations and motivation. In Lewis, R., &amp;  Zibarris, R. (Eds.), Work and Occupational Psychology: Integrating Theory and Practice. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; For example, I/O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking, and ruminative thinking, in turn, is associated with poor well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Sprigg, C., Armitage, J., &amp; Satchwell, A . (2013). Ruminative thinking exacerbates the negative effects of workplace violence ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 86(1), 67–84.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has found that interpersonal aggressive behaviours is associated with worse team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C, &amp; Rousseau, V . (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remuneration and compensation===
{{main|Remuneration}}
Compensation includes wages or salary, bonuses, pension/retirement contributions, and [[employee benefits]] that can be converted to cash or replace living expenses. I/O psychologists may be asked to conduct a [[job evaluation]] for the purpose of determining compensation levels and ranges. I/O psychologists may also serve as [[expert witness]]es in pay discrimination cases, when disparities in pay for similar work are alleged by employees.

===Training and training evaluation===
{{main|Training}}
Training involves the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes that results in improved performance in another environment.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"&gt;Goldstein, I. L., &amp; Ford, J. K. (2002). ''Training in organizations: Needs assessment, development, and evaluation'' (4th ed). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Because many people hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training may be needed to help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, W., Bennett, W., Edens, P.S., &amp; Bell, S.T. (2003). Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 234–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to performance management (see above), an I/O psychologist would employ a [[job analysis]] in concert with the application of the principles of [[instructional design]] to create an effective training program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} A training program is likely to include a [[summative evaluation]] at its conclusion in order to ensure that trainees have met the training objectives and can perform the target work tasks at an acceptable level. Training programs often include [[formative assessments|formative evaluations]] to assess the effect of the training as the training proceeds. Formative evaluations can be used to locate problems in training procedures and help I/O psychologists make corrective adjustments while training is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The foundation for training programs is [[learning]]. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraiger, K., Ford, J. K., &amp; Salas, E. (1993). Application of cognitive, skill-based, and affective theories of learning outcomes to new methods of training evaluation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78'', 311 – 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive training is aimed at instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S.H., &amp; Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance. In N. Schmitt &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''Personnel selection in organizations'' (pp. 35–70). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[needs assessment]], an analysis of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior to the development of a training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P. Schultz, Sydney Ellen|title=''Psychology and work today: An introduction to industrial and organizational psychology''|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-205-68358-4|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=164}} In addition, a careful [[needs analysis]] is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"/&gt; A [[training needs analysis]] typically involves a three-step process that includes [[organizational analysis]], [[task analysis]] and person analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Dierdorff, E. C., &amp; Surface, E. A. (2008). Assessing training needs: Do work experience and capability matter? Human Performance, 21, 28–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

An organizational analysis is an examination of organizational goals and resources as well as the organizational environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for [[transfer of training]]. An organizational analysis also takes into account the [[organisation climate|climate]] of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2002a). Modifying supervisory practices to improve subunit safety: A leadership-based intervention model. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 87'', 587–596.&lt;/ref&gt; A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify "core competencies" that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Shippmann, J. S. et al. (2000). The practice of competency modeling. ''Personnel Psychology, 53'', 703–740.&lt;/ref&gt; A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.

===Motivation in the workplace===
{{main|Work motivation}}
Work motivation reflects the energy an individual applies "to initiate work-related behavior, and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration"&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinder, C. C.(2008). ''Work motivation in organizational behavior'' (2nd edition). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to I/O psychology. [[Motivation]] is generally thought of as a theoretical construct that fuels behavior. An [[incentive]] is an anticipated reward that is thought to incline a person to behave a certain way.&lt;ref name="Dec"&gt;Deckers, L. (2010). ''Motivation: Biological, psychological and environmental'' (3rd ed., pp. 2–3). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation varies among individuals. Studying its influence on behavior, it must be examined together with ability and environmental influences. Because of motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance, many organizations structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage unproductive behaviors.&lt;ref name="jex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, T.R.; Daniels, D. 2003. Motivation. ''Handbook of Psychology'', Vol. 12. Industrial Organizational Psychology, ed. W.C. Borman, D.R. Ilgen, R.J. Klimoski, pp. 225–54. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Arousal is what initiates action. It is often fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from his or her life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors.  First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Occupational stress===
{{main|Occupational stress}}
I/O psychologists are involved in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Vinchur, A.J, &amp; Koppes, L.L.

Sinangil, (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial, work and organizational psychology, Vol. 2, Organizational Psychology'' (pp.93–115). Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions job stress evokes.

===Organizational culture===
{{main|Organizational culture}}
Organizational culture has been described as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Organizational culture has been shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.

In addition to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Examples of subcultures include corporate culture, departmental culture, local culture, and issue-related culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While there is no single "type" of organizational culture, some researchers have developed models to describe different organizational cultures.

===Group behavior===
{{main|Group behavior}}
Group behavior involves the interactions among individuals in a collective. The individuals' [[opinions]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and adaptations affect group behavior and group behavior, in turn, affects those opinions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, R., Roberts, M., &amp; Gureckis, T. (2008). Emergent processes of group behavior. ''Group Behavior, 17'', 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The interactions are thought to fulfill some need satisfaction in an individual who is part of the collective.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; A specific area of I/O research in group behavior is the team dynamics and team effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Team effectiveness====
{{main|Team effectiveness}}
Organizations often organize teams because teams can accomplish a much greater amount of work in a short period of time than an individual can accomplish.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; I/O research has examined the harm workplace aggression does to team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, V. &amp;  Aube, C. (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84''(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team composition====
The selection of individuals to be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition that should be considered during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels are more likely to be effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo, R.A., &amp; Shea, G.P. (1992). Group performance and intergroup relations in organizations. ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (Vol. 3, pp. 269–313).

(1990). Work teams: Applications and effectiveness. ''American Psychologist, 45''(2), 120–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Vianen, A.E.M. &amp; De Dreu, C.K.W. (2001). Personality in teams: Its relationship to social cohesion, task cohesion, and team performance.

====Task design====
{{main|Job design}}
A fundamental question in team task design is whether or not a task is even appropriate for a team. Those tasks that require predominantly independent work are best left to individuals, and team tasks should include those tasks that consist primarily of interdependent work.&lt;ref name=jex&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology.'' Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; When a given task is appropriate for a team, task design can play a key role in team effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Sundstrom, E., McIntyre, M., Halfhill, T., &amp; Richards, H. (2000) Work groups: From the Hawthorne studies to work teams of the 1990s and beyond. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 4'', 44-67. doi:org/10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job characteristic theory]] identifies core job dimensions that affect motivation, satisfaction, performance, etc. These dimensions include skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975). Development of job diagnostic survey. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 60'', 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions map well to the team environment. Individual contributors who perform team tasks that are challenging, interesting, and engaging are more likely to be motivated to exert greater effort and perform better than team members who are working on tasks that lack those characteristics.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt;

====Organizational resources====
Organizational support systems affect the team effectiveness&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt; and provide resources for teams operating in the multi-team environment. During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling resources are first identified. Examples of enabling resources include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; Team-specific resources (e.g., budgetary resources, human resources) are typically made available. Team-specific human resources represent the individual contributors who are selected to be  team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific resources.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Teams also function in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting organizational contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Salas, E., Stagl, K., &amp; Burke, C. (2004). 25 years of team effectiveness in organizations: Research themes and emerging needs, In C. Cooper &amp; I. Robertson (Eds.), ''International review of industrial and organizational psychology'', Vol. 19 (pp. 47–91). Chichester, UK: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from conditions in which organizational resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.

====Team rewards====
Organizational reward systems drive the strengthening and enhancing of individual team member efforts; such efforts contribute towards reaching team goals.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., &amp; Kreitner, R. (1985). ''Organizational behavior modification and beyond: An operant and social learning approach'' (2nd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, rewards that are given to individual team members should be contingent upon the performance of the entire team.&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt;

Several design elements are needed to enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If this is not the case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Wageman, R., &amp; Baker, G. (1997). Incentives and cooperation: The joint effects of task and reward interdependence on group performance. ''Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18'', 139–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Dematteo, J.S., Eby, L.T., &amp; Sundstrom, E. (1998). Team-based rewards: Current empirical evidence and directions for future research. ''Research in Organizational Behavior, 20'', 141–83.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, V.Y., &amp; Taggar, S. (2006). Antecedents of team reward attitude. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 10'', 194–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team goals====
Goals potentially motivate team members when goals contain three elements: difficulty, acceptance, and specificity.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, E.A., &amp; Latham, G.P. (1990). ''A theory of goal setting and task performance''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Under difficult goal conditions, teams with more committed members tend to outperform teams with less committed members.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, K. (1994). Improving group task performance: The role of group goals and group efficacy. ''Human Performance, 7'', 55–78.&lt;/ref&gt; When team members commit to team goals, team effectiveness is a function of how supportive members are with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C., &amp; Rousseau, V. (2005). Team goal commitment and team effectiveness: The role of task interdependence and supportive behaviors. ''Group dynamics: Theory, research, and practice, 9'', 189–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of individual team members and team goals interact. Team and individual goals must be coordinated. Individual goals must be consistent with team goals in order for a team to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, T.R., &amp; Silver, W.R. (1990). Individual and group goals when workers are interdependent. Effects on task strategy and performance. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 75'', 185–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job satisfaction and commitment===
{{main|Job satisfaction}}
Job satisfaction is often thought to reflect the extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P.E. (1997). ''Job satisfaction: Application, assessment, causes and consequences''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83''(4), 915–934.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productive behavior===
Productive behavior is defined as employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during which he or she may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role ''and'' extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

====Job performance====
{{main|Job performance}}
[[Job performance]] represents behaviors employees engage in while at work which contribute to organizational goals.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (2nd ed., Vol 1, pp. 687–732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization as part of an employee's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to be precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

To model job performance, researchers have attempted to define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using a common set of dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, E.W. (1994). Role definitions and organizational citizenship behavior: The importance of the employee's perspective. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 37, 1543–67.&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly made by both employees and management.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"&gt;Van Dyne &amp; LePine (1998). Helping and Voice Extra-role Behaviors: Evidence of Construct and Predictive Validity, ''The Academy of Management Journal'', Vol. 41, No. 1 (Feb. 1998, pp. 108–19).&lt;/ref&gt; A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1994). Alternative models of job performance and their implications for selection and classification. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 33–51). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1994). Toward a broad conceptualization of jobs and job performance: Impact of changes in the military environment on the structure, assessment, and prediction of job performance. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 85–102), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, down-time behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings.&lt;ref name=Murphy1989&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1989).  Dimensions of job performance. In R. Dillon &amp; J.W. Pelligrino (Eds.), ''Testing: Theoretical and applied perspectives'' (pp. 218–47). New York: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"/&gt; Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well "employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job."&lt;ref name="jex2008104"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). Organizational Psychology. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work for the benefit of the group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.

To assess job performance, reliable and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with [[Performance Rating (Work Measurement)|performance ratings]], error can be reduced through rater training&lt;ref name= "Pulakos1984"&gt;Pulakos, E.D. (1984). A comparison of rater training programs: Error training and accuracy training. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 69, 581–88)&lt;/ref&gt; and through the use of behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"/&gt; and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.

The determinants of job performance consist of factors having to do with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance,&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"/&gt; job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.

Regardless of the job, three determinants stand out as predictors of performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although there is a law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name= "Baron"&gt;Baron, R.; Handley R. &amp; Fund S. (2006). The impact of emotional intelligence on performance. In V.U. Druskat; F. Sala &amp; G. Mount (Eds.), ''Linking emotional intelligence and performance at work: Current research evidence with individuals and groups'' (pp. 3–19). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goleman"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). ''Working with Emotional Intelligence''. New York: Bantam Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{main|Organizational citizenship behavior}}
Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are another form of workplace behavior that I/O psychologists are involved with. OCBs tend to be beneficial to both the organization and other workers. Dennis Organ (1988) defines OCBs as "individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization."&lt;ref name="Organ1988"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1988). ''Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome''. Lexington, MA England: Lexington Books/D.C. Heath and Com.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors that qualify as OCBs can fall into one of the following five categories: altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, and civic virtue.&lt;ref name="Organ1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1977"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1977). Inferences about trends in labor force satisfaction: A causal-correlational analysis. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 20(4), 510–19. {{doi|10.2307/255353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1994"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1994). Organizational citizenship behavior and the good soldier. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker; J. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 53–67). Hillsdale, NJ England: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; OCBs have also been categorized in other ways too, for example, by their intended targets (individuals, supervisors, and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name="WilliamsAnderson"&gt;Williams, L.J. &amp; Anderson, S.E. (1994). Job satisfaction and organizational commitment as predictors of organizational citizenship and in-role behavior. ''Journal of Management, 17'', 601–17&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternative ways of categorizing OCBs include "compulsory OCBs," which are engaged in owing to coercive persuasion or peer pressure rather than out of good will.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"&gt;Vigoda-Gadot, E. (2006). Compulsory citizenship behavior: Theorizing some dark sides of the Good Soldier Syndrome in organizations. ''Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 36'', 77–93. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-5914.2006.00297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which OCBs are voluntary has been the subject of some debate.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"/&gt;

Other research suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally part of the job description, performing them can influence performance appraisals.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of "impression management," a term coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959). ''The presentation of self in everyday life''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman defined impression management as "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.&lt;ref name="Bolino"&gt;Bolino, M.C. (1999). Citizenship and impression management: Good soldiers or good actors? Academy of Management Review, 24(1), 82–98. {{doi|10.2307/259038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
{{main|Innovation}}
Industrial and organizational psychologists consider [[innovation]], more often than not, a variable of less importance and often a counter-productive one to include in conducting job performance appraisals when irrelevant to the major job functions for which a given job exists. Nonetheless, I/O psychologists see the value of that variable where its consideration would, were its reliability and validity questioned, achieve a statistically significant probability that its results are not due to chance, and that it can be replicated reliably with a statistically significant ratio of reliability, and that were a court to raise a question on its reliability and validity testing, the I/O psychologist behind its use would be able to defend it before a court of justice with the belief that it will stand before such a court as reliable, and valid{{clarify|pre-text=remove or|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Four qualities are generally linked to creative and innovative behaviour by individuals:&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; 
* Task-relevant skills (general mental ability and job specific knowledge). Task specific and subject specific knowledge is most often gained through higher education; however, it may also be gained by mentoring and experience in a given field.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;
* Creativity-relevant skills (ability to concentrate on a problem for long periods of time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex &amp; Britt as productive forgetting.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.
* Task motivation (internal desire to perform task and level of enjoyment).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

At the organizational level, a study by Damanpour identified four specific characteristics that may predict innovation:&lt;ref&gt;Damanpour, F. (1991). Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 34, 555–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{main|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior (CWB) can be defined as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result from a wide range of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft).&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt; It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt;

The forms of counterproductive behavior with the most empirical examination are ineffective [[job performance]], [[absenteeism]], [[job turnover]], and [[accident]]s. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and [[sexual harassment]].

===Leadership===
{{main|Leadership}}
In I/O psychology, leadership can be defined as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Yukl, G. (2010). Leadership in organizations (7th Ed.). New Jersey: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction should be made between leadership and [[management]]. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared organizational culture and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R.L. (2011). ''Leadership'' (5th Ed.). Australia: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches to studying leadership in I/O psychology can be broadly classified into three categories: Leader-focused approaches, contingency-focused approaches, and follower-focused approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Leader-focused approaches====
Leader-focused approaches look to organizational leaders to determine the characteristics of effective [[leadership]]. According to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]], more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach is being used to predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.L.; Ginnett, R.C. &amp; Curphy, G.J. (2009). ''Leadership: Enhancing the lessons of experience'' (6th Ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Another leader-focused approached is the '''behavioral approach''' which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|consideration]]; and (2) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|initiating structure]]. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is '''[[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[social influence|influence]]'''. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: [[French &amp; Raven's Five bases of Power|coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power]], and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational [[persuasion]], inspirational appeal, consultation, [[ingratiation]], exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational Psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd Ed.). New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contingency-focused approaches====
Of the 3 approaches to leadership, contingency-focused approaches have been the most prevalent over the past 30 years. Contingency-focused theories base a leader's effectiveness on their ability to assess a situation and adapt their behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; These theories assume that an effective leader can accurately "read" a situation and skillfully employ a leadership style that meets the needs of the individuals involved and the task at hand. A brief introduction to the most prominent contingency-focused theories will follow.

[[Fiedler contingency model|Fiedler's Contingency Theory]] holds that a leader's effectiveness depends on the interaction between their characteristics and the characteristics of the situation. [[Path–Goal Theory]] asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The [[Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX)|Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model]] focuses on how leader–subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goleman |first= Daniel |title=Primal Leadership |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model]] focuses on decision making with respect to a ''feasibility set''&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; which is composed of the situational attributes.

In addition to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, there has been a high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is [[transformational leadership]], which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is [[transactional leadership]], which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.

====Follower-focused approaches====
Follower-focused approaches look at the processes by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature in the domain of [[motivation]] in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in [[team]]s and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders need to be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.

An emerging area of I/O research in the area of team leadership is in leading [[virtual team]]s, where people in the team are geographically-distributed across various distances and sometimes even countries. While technological advances have enabled the leadership process to take place in such virtual contexts, they present new challenges for leaders as well, such as the need to use technology to build relationships with followers, and influencing followers when faced with limited (or no) face-to-face interaction.

====Organizational development====
{{Main|Organization development}}
I/O psychologists are also concerned with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who may want to take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most  tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, I/O psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, group cohesiveness, and working effectiveness.&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;

===Relation to organizational behavior===

The I/O psychology and [[organizational behavior]] have manifested some overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, J.(2006) ''Organizational behavior 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations and the future''. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The overlap has led to some confusion regarding how the two disciplines differ.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S.M., &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd ed.). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much confusion about the differences between I/O psychology and [[human resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/human-resources-vs-organisational-psychology/|title=Human Resources vs Organisational Psychology - Find My Pathway|date=2018-10-21|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[human resource management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guest|first=David E.|date=1994|title=Organizational psychology and human resource management: Towards a european approach|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594329408410488?journalCode=pewo19|journal=European Work and Organizational Psychologist|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=251–270|doi=10.1080/13594329408410488|issn=0960-2003|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

The minimum requirement for working as an I/O psychologist is a master's degree. Normally, this degree requires about 2–3 years to complete. Of all the degrees granted in I/O psychology each year, approximately two thirds are at the master's level.&lt;ref name=schultz /&gt;{{rp|page=18}}
 
A comprehensive list of US and Canadian master's and doctoral programs can be found at the web site of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).&lt;ref name="siop.org"&gt;[http://www.siop.org/gtp/gtplookup.asp Graduate Training Programs (visited web site on March 22, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Admission into I/O psychology PhD programs is highly competitive given that many programs accept a small number of applicants every year.
 
There are graduate degree programs in I/O psychology outside of the US and Canada. The SIOP web site&lt;ref name="siop.org"/&gt; also provides a comprehensive list of I/O programs in many other countries.

In Australia, Organizational Psychologists must be accredited by the [[Australian Psychological Society|Australia Psychological Society]] (APS). To become an Organizational Psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a general psychologist's licence: 3 years studying bachelor's degree in Psychology, 4th year Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development. There are other avenues available, such as a two year supervised training program after Honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/psychology/psychology-internships/|title=Psychology Internship Pathways - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/Provisional.aspx|title=Psychology Board of Australia - Provisional registration|website=www.psychologyboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After this, psychologists can elect to specialize as Organizational Psychologists.

===Competencies===

There are many different sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or she might not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, [[interpersonal skills]] (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, T.G., &amp; Worley, C.G. (2015). ''Organization development and change''. Boston: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job outlook===

According to the United States Department of Labor's [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], I/O psychology is the fastest growing occupation in the United States, based on projections between 2012 and 2022.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fastest-growing-jobs-2013-12?op=1#1-industrial-organizational-psychologists-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowling Green, OH: Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; the median salary for a PhD in I/O psychology was $98,000; for a master's level I/O psychologist was $72,000. The highest paid PhD I/O psychologists in private industry worked in pharmaceuticals and averaged approximately $151,000 per year; the median salary for self-employed consultants was $150,000; those employed in retail, energy, and manufacturing followed closely behind, averaging approximately $133,000. The lowest earners were found in state and local government positions, averaging approximately $77,000. In 2005, I/O psychologists whose primary responsibility is teaching at private and public colleges and universities often earn additional income from consulting with government and industry.&lt;ref&gt;Medsker, G. J., Katkowski, D. A., &amp; Furr, D. (2005). 2003 employment survey results for the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Bowling Green, OH: Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;The job opportunities have been on a steady rise for the past few years &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
An I/O psychologist, whether an academic, a consultant, or an employee, must maintain high ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;Biech, E. (Ed.) (2007). The ethics of the business. ''The business of consulting: The basics and beyond'' (pp. 231–244). San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; The APA's ethical principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the ethical standards set at home.&lt;ref&gt;Mobley, W. H. (2008). Rules of thumb for international consultants. In J. W. Hedge, &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''The I/O consultant: Advice and insights for building a successful career'' (pp. 309–314).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''''Into the Open''''', subtitled "New Paintings, Prints and Sculptures by Contemporary Black Artists", was an exhibition of art by black artists displayed at various venues in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1984.

This exhibition was the first major survey by a municipal gallery of contemporary work by [[black artists]] in Britain, and is considered one of the landmark exhibitions of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Chambers, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dYDoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22into+the+open%22+exhibition+black+artists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI4PjDjrXdxwIVh9gaCh2mewRj#v=onepage&amp;q=%22into%20the%20open%22%20exhibition%20black%20artists&amp;f=false ''Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s''], I.B. Tauris, 2014, p. 113. {{ISBN|1780762720}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was curated, at the invitation of [[Sheffield City Arts Department]], by two people closely involved with black artists in Britain: [[Pogus Caesar]] and [[Lubaina Himid]].  Their stated aim was to give an indication of the range and richness of art made by contemporary [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro Caribbean]] artists.

The ''Into the Open'' exhibition toured in the United Kingdom in 1984, appearing at three venues: the [[Mappin Art Gallery]] in [[Sheffield]] (4 August–9 September 1984), the [[Nottingham Castle#Nottingham Castle Museum|Castle Museum]] in [[Nottingham]] (16 September–21 October 1984), and the [[Newcastle Media Workshops]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] (2–24 November 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (2014), note 20, pp. 255–56.&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized by the Sheffield Arts Department and was subsidised by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10622">{{Anthropology of kinship}}
The following list includes societies that have been identified as [[matrilineal]] or [[matrilocal]] in ethnographic literature.

"Matrilineal" means property is passed down through the maternal line on the death of the mother, not that of the father.

The Akans of Ghana, West Africa, are matrlineals. Akans are the largest ethnic group in Ghana. They are made of the Akims, Asantes, Fantis, Akuapims, Kwahus, Denkyiras, Brongs, Akwamus, Krachis etc.

"Matrilocal" means new families are established in proximity to the brides' extended family of origin, not that of the groom.

Note: ''separate'' in the marriage column refers to the practice of husbands and wives living in separate locations, often informally called ''[[walking marriage]]s''. See the articles for the specific cultures that practice this for further description.

In a number of islands, including Lesbos, Lemnos, Naxos, and Kos, matrilineal succession to real property was the rule at the end of the 18th century A.D. The facts were reported by an English traveller, John Hawkins, who wrote: "In the large number of the islands, the eldest daughter takes as her inheritance a portion of the family house, together with its furniture, and one third of the share of the maternal property, which in reality in most of these cases constitutes the chief means of subsistence; the other daughters, when they marry off in succession, are likewise entitled to (a portion of) the family house and the same share of whatever property remains. These observations were applicable to the islands of Mytilin (Lesbos), Lemnos, Scopelo, Skyros, Syra, Zea Ipsera, Myconi, Paros, Naxia, Siphno, Santorini and Cos, where I have either collected my information in person or had obtained it through others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mustahabb''' ({{Lang-ar|مستحبّ|lit=recommended}}) is an [[Islamic term]] referring to recommended, favoured or [[virtue|virtuous]] actions.

Mustahabb actions are those whose status of approval in Islamic law (''[[ahkam]]'') falls between ''[[mubah]]'' (neither encouraged nor discouraged) and ''[[wajib]]'' (compulsory). One definition is "duties recommended, but not essential; fulfilment of which is rewarded, though they may be neglected without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Levy, ''The Social Structure of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;202&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms of ''mustahabb'' include ''masnun'' and ''mandub''. The opposite of ''mustahabb'' is ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged).

==Examples==
There are thousands of mustahabb acts,&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Colin|title=Islam: The Basics|publisher=Routledge|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=utxkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Mustahabb+example#v=onepage&amp;q=Mustahabb%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014|isbn=9781134296910|date=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: 

* [[As-Salamu Alaykum]] (a traditional Islamic [[greeting]],(the islamic greeting is FARD on the believers) Arabic for "peace be upon you") 
* [[Sadaqah]] (charity outside of [[zakat]])
* [[Umrah]]
* two Rakat before Fajr
* tayyitul masjid (two Rakat when entering the mosque); some scholars hold it to be fard due to certain evidences and Allah knows best.
* salatul witr
One must know that mustahabb are acts that increase or bring reward, but there is no sin if left off.

The '''National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)''' is located on the campus of [[Michigan State University]] and is the leading [[isotope|rare isotope]] research facility in the United States.&lt;ref name=Bruns&gt;Bruns, Adam (January 2009).[http://www.siteselection.com/features/2009/jan/Michigan/ How Are You Helping Companies Grow?].''Site Selection Magazine''.Retrieved on December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1963, the [[cyclotron]] laboratory is the nation’s largest nuclear science facility on a university campus.&lt;ref name="The National Science Foundation"&gt;[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/oct2606/nsclFunds.html The National Science Foundation (NSF)] 4/10/2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128154747/http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/oct2606/nsclFunds.html |date=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and MSU, the NSCL operates two superconducting cyclotrons. The lab’s scientists investigate the properties of rare isotopes and [[nuclear reactions]]. In nature, these reactions would take place in [[star]]s and exploding stellar environments such as [[nova]]e and [[supernovae]]. The K1200 cyclotron is the highest-energy continuous beam accelerator in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2007/pdf/fy2007.pdf |title=FY 2007 Budget Request to Congress |accessdate=2008-07-21 |author=National Science Foundation |date=2006-02-06 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the laboratory's primary goal is to understand the mysteries that reside at the center of [[atoms]], in [[atomic nuclei]]. Atomic nuclei are ten thousand times smaller than the atoms they reside in, but they contain nearly all the atom’s mass (more than 99.9 percent).&lt;ref name="The National Science Foundation" /&gt;
Many of the atomic nuclei found on earth are stable atomically. But there are many unstable and rare isotopes that exist in the universe, sometimes only for a fleeting moment inside "cosmic cauldrons." Scientists at the NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research. They make and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on earth—where they have long decayed into the known, stable or long-lived isotopes.
Rare isotope research is essential for understanding how the elements—and ultimately the universe—were formed.

Today, approximately 10 percent of U.S. nuclear science Ph.D.s are educated at NSCL. The nuclear physics graduate program at MSU is ranked best in America by the
[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-physics-schools/nuclear-science 2010 Best Grad Schools index published by U.S. News &amp; World Report graduate ranking].

==Laboratory  upgrades==

The upgrade plans are in close alignment with a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081130140534/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/RISAC.html report] issued December 2006 by the National Academies, "Scientific Opportunities with a Rare-Isotope Facility in the United States," which defines a scientific agenda for a U.S.-based rare-isotope facility and addresses the need for such a facility in context of international efforts in this area. Now, NSCL is planning for a significant capability upgrade that will keep the laboratory – and nuclear science – at the cutting edge well into the 21st century.

The proposed upgrade of NSCL – the $550 million [[Facility for Rare Isotope Beams]] (FRIB) – will boost intensities and varieties of rare isotope beams produced at MSU by replacing the K500 and K1200 cyclotrons with a powerful linear accelerator to be built beneath the ground. Such beams will allow researchers and students to continue to address a host of questions at the intellectual frontier of nuclear science: How does the behavior of novel and short-lived nuclei differ from more stable nuclei? What is the nature of nuclear processes in explosive stellar environments? What is the structure of hot nuclear matter at abnormal densities?

[[File:MSU Cyclotron.jpg|left|thumb|300 px|The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.]]

Beyond basic research, FRIB may lead to cross-disciplinary benefits. Experiments there will help astronomers better interpret data from ground- and space-based observatories. Scientists at the Isotope Science Facility will contribute to research on self-organization and complexity arising from elementary interactions, a topic relevant to the life sciences and quantum computing. Additionally, the facility's capabilities may lead to advances in fields as diverse as biomedicine, materials science, national and international security, and nuclear energy.

==Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics==
The [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics]] (JINA) is a collaboration between Michigan State University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Chicago to address a broad range of experimental, theoretical, and observational questions in nuclear astrophysics.  A portion of the Michigan State collaboration is housed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, directly involving roughly 30 nuclear physicists and astrophysicists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jinaweb.org/ JINA-CEE, Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Evolution===
Similar sequences are often found along [[protein]] [[polypeptide]] chains in different species. This similarity is directly linked to the sequence of the [[DNA]] (the genetic material of the organism). Due to the improbability of this being random chance, and its consistency too long to be attributed to convergence by [[natural selection]], these similarities can be plausibly linked to the existence of a common ancestor with common genes. This allows polypeptide sequences to be compared between species, and the difference between two genetic sequences can be used to determine - within error - the time at which a common ancestor existed.&lt;ref name="Pauling" /&gt;

====Human evolution====
Using the thigh bone of a [[Neanderthal]] female, 63% of the Neanderthal genome was uncovered and 3.7 billion bases of DNA were decoded.&lt;ref name="pmid20448178"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green RE, Krause J, Briggs AW, Maricic T, Stenzel U, Kircher M, Patterson N, Li H, Zhai W | title = A draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979 | pages = 710–22 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 20448178 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188021 |display-authors=etal | pmc=5100745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saey&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saey TH | title = Story one: Team decodes neanderthal DNA: Genome draft may reveal secrets of human evolution | journal = Science News | year = 2009 | volume = 175 | issue = 6 | pages = 5–7 | doi = 10.1002/scin.2009.5591750604}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' was the closest living relative of ''Homo sapiens,'' until the former lineage died out 30,000 years ago. The Neanderthal [[genome]] was shown to be within the range of variation of those of anatomically modern humans, although at the far periphery of that range of variation. Paleogenetic analysis also suggests that Neanderthals shared more DNA with chimpanzees than ''homo sapiens''.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; It was also found that Neanderthals were less genetically diverse than modern humans are, which indicates that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' grew from a group composed of relatively few individuals.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; DNA sequences suggest that ''Homo sapiens'' first appeared  between about 130,000 and 250,000 years ago in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt;

Paleogenetics opens up many new possibilities for the study of hominid evolution and dispersion. By analyzing the genomes of [[hominid]] remains, their lineage can be traced back to from where they came, or from where they share a common ancestor. The [[Denisova hominid]], a species of hominid found in [[Siberia]] from which DNA was able to be extracted, may show signs of having genes that are not found in any Neanderthal nor [[Homo sapiens]] genome, possibly representing a new lineage or species of hominid.&lt;ref name="Zorich"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zorich Z | year = 2010 | title = Neanderthal Genome Decoded | journal = Archaeology | publisher = Archaeological Institute of America | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = | url = http://www.archaeology.org/1007/etc/neanderthal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of culture===
Looking at DNA can give insight into lifestyles of people of the past. Neandertal DNA shows that they lived in small temporary communities.&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt; DNA analysis can also show dietary restrictions and mutations, such as the fact that ''Homo neanderthalensis'' was [[Lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]].&lt;ref name="Saey"/&gt;

==Archaeology==

===Ancient disease===
Studying DNA of the deceased also allows us to look at the medical history of the human race. By looking back we can discover when certain diseases first appeared and began to afflict humans.

====Ötzi====
The oldest case of [[Lyme disease]] was discovered in the genome on a man called [[Ötzi|Ötzi the Iceman]].&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keller A, Graefen A, Ball M, Matzas M, Boisguerin V, Maixner F, Leidinger P, Backes C, Khairat R | title = New insights into the Tyrolean Iceman's origin and phenotype as inferred by whole-genome sequencing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 698 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22426219 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1701 | layurl = http://news.discovery.com/history/iceman-mummy-lyme-disease-120228.html | laysource = DiscoveryNews |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ötzi died around 3,300 B.C., and his remains were discovered in the Eastern Alps in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"/&gt; An analysis of his genes was not run until 20 years later. Genetic remains of the bacterium that cause Lyme disease, ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', were discovered in genetic material from Ötzi.&lt;ref name="Keller_2012"/&gt;

===Domestication of animals===
Not only can past humans be investigated through paleogenetics, but the organisms they had an effect on can also be examined. Through examination of the divergence found in [[domesticated]] species such as [[cattle]] and the archaeological record from their wild counterparts; the effect of domestication can be studied, which could tell us a lot about the behaviors of the cultures that domesticated them. The genetics of these animals also reveals traits not shown in the paleontological remains, such as certain clues as to the behavior, development, and maturation of these animals. The diversity in genes can also tell where the species were domesticated, and how these domesticates migrated from these locations elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Ancient remains usually contain only a small fraction of the original [[DNA]] present in an organism.&lt;ref name="Pauling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Matt. [http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555 DNA has a 521-year half-life.] ''Nature News'', 10 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the [[DNA#Damage|degradation of DNA]] in dead tissue by biotic and abiotic factors once repair enzymes present in living tissue cease to be functional. DNA preservation is dependent on a number of environmental characteristics, including temperature, humidity, oxygen and sunlight. Remains from regions with high heat and humidity typically contain less intact DNA than those from [[permafrost]] or caves, where remains may persist in cold, low oxygen conditions for several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest. [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/02/dna_testing_richard_iii_how_long_does_dna_last.html What’s the Shelf-Life of DNA?] [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, DNA degrades much more quickly following excavation of materials, and freshly excavated bone has a much higher chance of containing viable genetic material.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt; After [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], bone may also become contaminated with modern DNA (i.e. from contact with skin or unsterilized tools), which can create false-positive results.&lt;ref name="Geigl" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Srinivasa Ramanujan - OPC - 1.jpg|thumb|[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (1887-1920)]]
The University of Madras was incorporated in 1857 and the Department of Mathematics was an integral part of the university from its beginning. The department developed from its early years to become a centre of research in mathematics with the appointment of [[R. Vaidyanathaswamy]] as a Reader in Mathematics in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;http://riasm.unom.ac.in/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics were sown when the "Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics" was established by [[Alagappa Chettiar]] on 26 January 1950 as a memorial to the mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. It was governed by the Asoka Charitable Trust, [[Karaikudi]], and was located at Krishna Vilas, [[Vepery]], [[Chennai]]. The Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics was inaugurated by A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar, [[Vice Chancellor]] of University of Madras, with [[T. Vijayaraghavan]], a student of [[G.H. Hardy]], as Director of the Institute. The institute faced a financial crisis when, in  1956, Asoka Charitable Trust expressed its inability to run the institute. However, due to an initiative taken by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the management of the institute came to be vested with the University of Madras and the institute was taken over by the university in May 1957.

During the short period of existence, the institute had a string of prominent mathematicians as visitors, including [[S.S. Pillai]], noted number theorist, V. Ganapathy Iyer, analyst and [[Norbert Wiener]]. After the demise of T. Vijayaraghavan in 1955, C.T. Rajagopal took over as the Director of the Institute.

From 1957 to 1966, the Department of Mathematics and the Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics functioned as independent bodies under the University of Madras.&lt;ref&gt;http://riasm.unom.ac.in/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the [[University Grants Commission (India)]] proposed to make the Department of Mathematics of the University of Madras into one of its Centres of Advanced Study. In the same year these two institutions were amalgamated to form a UGC Centre for Advanced Study in Mathematics and named the center as the "Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics" (RIASM).

C.T. Rajagopal was appointed the first Director of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, and when he retired in 1969, the reins were taken over by T.S. Bhanumurthy.

==Ramanujan Museum==
Utilising a grant of Rs. 1 lakh received as UGC Special Assistance for Equipment and with the help of the Vikram A. Sarabhai Community Science Centre, [[Ahmedabad]] a Mathematical Laboratory  was established in the institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramanujanmuseum.org/&lt;/ref&gt; About 65 mathematical models were acquired under the scheme. These models were exhibited

* for the participants of several Refresher Courses conducted through the Academic Staff College of the University of Madras,
* at the Silver Jubiliee conference of the Association of Mathematics Teachers of India held at Madras during 10–13 January 1991,
* in the Science Exhibition held at National Institute of Technology, [[Tiruchirapalli]] during 10–14 July 1991, and
* are being lent to be exhibited in several schools in and around [[Chennai]].

Later the institute received an amount of Rs. 2 lakh from the [[National Board for Higher Mathematics]], Rs. 1 lakh from ''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper and Rs. 9 lakh from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Government of India, and a matching grant of Rs. 9 lakh from the University of Madras.  The amount was used to establish the Ramanujan Museum in the premises of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics. A grant of rupees one crore was later sanctioned by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, towards the establishment of Ramanujan Museum and Research Centre.

[[File:ПГУ_им._Шолом-Алейхема.jpg|thumb|Sholem Aleichem Amur State University]]
'''Sholem Aleichem Amur State University''' ({{lang-ru|Приамурский государственный университет имени Шолом-Алейхема}}), formerly '''Birobidzhan State Pedagogical Institute''', is a [[university]] in [[Russia]]. This is the only university based in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]. It is named after Jewish-Russian author [[Sholem Aleichem]].

==Overview==
The university works in cooperation with the local Jewish community of [[Birobidzhan]] and the [[Birobidzhan Synagogue]]. It is unique in the [[Russian Far East]]. The basis of the training courses is study of the [[Hebrew language]], history and classic [[Jewish]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Информационно-аналитическое управление правительства ЕАО |url=http://www.eao.ru/eng/?p=365 |title=Еврейская автономная область - официальный портал |publisher=Eao.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] has grown interest in its [[Jewish]] roots. Students study Hebrew and [[Yiddish]] at the Jewish school and Birobidzhan Jewish National University. In 1989, the Jewish Center founded a [[Sunday school]], where children can study Yiddish, learn [[Jewish]] [[folk dance|folk]]  [[dance]], and  [[history of Israel]]. The [[Israeli government]] helps fund this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204084032/http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the first Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Boris Kotlerman, a Yiddish studies professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2all.co.il/web/Sites/yiddishproject/ |title=Yiddish Summer School in Birobidzhan, Home |publisher=2all.co.il |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish is still the region’s second [[official language]] after [[Russian language|Russian]], although it is spoken only by a handful of 4,000 remaining Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liphshiz |first=Cnaan |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/account/new/index |title=Index for a million documents on Polish Jewry to go online &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070621171021/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program includes a workshop on the village of [[Valdgeym]] and its Yiddish [[Cultural heritage|heritage]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">'''Suzanne Césaire''' [née Roussi] (11 August 1915 – 16 May 1966), born in [[Martinique]], and was a writer, teacher, scholar, anti-colonial and feminist activist, and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]].

==Early life==
Suzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.

==University and marriage to Aimé Césaire==

During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who introduced her to [[Aimé Césaire]], a fellow student at the École normale supérieure.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]''. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.

==Literary career==
Suzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal ''Tropiques'', of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and [[René Ménil]], both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.

While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology ''The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean'' (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.

Césaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:

“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with [[André Breton]] following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Blachère, “Breton et Césaire: Flux et reflux d’une amitié”, Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146-159 (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of [[Afro-Surrealism]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Rosemont, ''Surrealist Women'' (2000) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of ''Tropiques'' can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. ''Tropiques'' was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of ''Tropiques'' towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of ''Tropiques'', published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nouvelleseditionsplace.com/produit/tropiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropiques'' published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientbookline/service/reference.asp?output=PORTAL&amp;INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP&amp;DOCID=0467910&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

Suzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of ''Tropiques'', she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed "Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]
Her encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - "La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]

The '''Swiss Nanoscience Institute''' (SNI) at the University of Basel is a center of excellence for nanosciences and nanotechnology. In the SNI network, interdisciplinary teams of scientists conduct basic and applied research and actively support knowledge and technology transfer to industry. Within the study of nanoscience and the PhD School, the SNI trains young scientists and prepares them for careers in industry and academia.

The SNI was founded in 2006 by the Canton of Aargau and the University of Basel to promote research and training in the nanosciences and nanotechnology in Northwestern Switzerland. Since then, numerous research projects have been successfully initiated in which researchers from various disciplines and institutions work together in one network. In addition to research and training, the SNI is also involved in public relations and provides targeted support for various initiatives, particularly those aiming to interest children and young people in the natural sciences.

== SNI network ==

The success of the SNI is based on the interdisciplinary network that has been built up and consolidated over the years. This network includes various departments at the University of Basel, the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Department for Biosystems Science and Engineering at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Basel (D-BSSE) and the CSEM (Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique) in Muttenz. Membership of the SNI, which is earned by participating in SNI projects, and regular academic conferences involving its members constantly stimulate and encourage the exchange of information within the network.

== Bachelor and Master Program ==

In 2002, the University of Basel – under the leadership of the SNI’s predecessor institution – launched the Bachelor’s and master's degree programs in nanosciences. Today, this demanding degree program is firmly established. Around 40 students who begin the Bachelor’s program each year receive a solid basic education in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and can subsequently choose from a wide range of courses that allow the students to focus on specific topics. Early on in their education, they have the opportunity to participate in various research groups, an activity that always proves particularly motivating.

== PhD School ==
 
To promote the further training of young scientists and a wide spectrum of basic scientific research, the SNI initiated a PhD School in 2013. At the end of 2014, 24 doctoral students were enrolled. Within the SNI PhD School, each doctoral student is supervised by two members of the SNI network. They also become involved in internal events such as the Winter School and the Annual Meeting and take part in various courses to gain insights into areas such as intellectual property, communication and rhetoric.

== Leaders in their field ==
 
Basic sciences form the foundation of research work at the SNI. In addition to the various projects funded as part of the PhD School, the SNI also supports the basic scientific research performed by Argovia professors Roderick Lim and Martino Poggio. Both were promoted to associate professor in 2014 and their research successes in nanobiology and nanotechnology have contributed to the SNI’s outstanding international reputation. The SNI also supports titular professors Frithjof Nolting and Thomas Jung, who work in the Department of Physics at the University of Basel and at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), and, from the end of 2014, Michel Kenzelmann who also works for the PSI and the Department of Physics.

== Practical application ==

Since it was founded, the SNI has placed great value on the transfer of academic findings to industry. To optimize this process, the SNI started an annual call for applied research projects. This program entitled Nano Argovia supports about ten projects each year from broad ranging areas of nanotechnology in close collaboration with industrial companies in Northwestern Switzerland and has a total budget of around 1.5 million Swiss francs. With the Nano Argovia program, the SNI is building an important bridge between research and application. In several cases, this collaboration has led to Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) and other follow-on projects.

== Services ==

The SNI views itself not only as a pure research institution, but also provides various services to industrial companies. In excellently equipped workshops for technology, electronics and mechanics, internal groups and industrial companies can harness the in-depth knowledge of the staff and the outstanding technical resources of the SNI and the affiliated departments.

== Sharing the fascination with others ==

The SNI wishes to involve the public in its fascination with the natural sciences through active communication and participation in various events. For example, the SNI team is actively involved in science festivals and fairs both at home and abroad, provides schools and groups of interested visitors with an insight into everyday laboratory life, and strives to make scientific achievement

'''''Taking the piss''''' is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] term meaning to take liberties at the expense of others, or to be joking, or to be unreasonable. It is a shortening of the idiom '''taking the piss out of,''' which is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning to [[Parody|mock]], tease, joke, ridicule, or scoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Chris Roberts (author)|first=Chris |last=Roberts|title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme|publisher=Thorndike Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7862-8517-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with "taking a piss", which refers to the act of urinating. '''Taking the Mickey''' (Mickey Bliss, [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]]), '''taking the Mick''' or '''taking the Michael''' is another term for making fun of someone. These terms are most widely used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].

==Usage==
The term sometimes refers to a form of mockery in which the mocker exaggerates the other person's characteristics; pretending to take on his or her attitudes, etc., for the purpose of comedic effect at the expense of another.  This would be described as "taking the piss" out of that person, or "a piss-take". It may be also be used to refer to a ruse whereby a person is led to believe a plainly unbelievable fact for the purpose of ridicule of the subject, e.g. "Are you being serious?" "No, I'm just taking the piss."

The phrase is in common usage throughout British society, employed by headline writers in broadsheet gazettes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2212788,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Taking the Mickey out of Saatchi | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | date=18 November 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tabloids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=380769&amp;in_page_id=1773 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Are Jordan and Peter taking the Mickey? | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as colloquially. It is also used in English speaking countries such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/20/1050777165949.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Taking the Mickey | date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/to-mitigate-gibbs-outburst-is-simply-taking-the-mickey/2007/01/16/1168709752692.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=To mitigate Gibbs outburst is simply taking the Mickey | date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial usage, "taking the piss" is also used to refer to someone or something that makes a claim which is not in line with a recognised agreement e.g. an invoice that is double the quoted price with no explanation for the added charge could be said to "take the piss", or likewise if something consistently misses a deadline.

The term can also mean to take unfair advantage.  For example, if someone has a food [[buffet]] and one guest clearly takes more than their expected share.  It can also relate to an abuse of trust, such as "''You can use my 'phone, but don't take the piss!''", i.e. do not abuse my offer of assistance by making lengthy calls that will cost me a lot of money.  Equally, a wilfully unproductive employee could be described as "taking the piss" for accepting a wage while knowingly failing to deliver on their obligation, or an employer could be accused of "taking the piss" for making unreasonable requests of their employees, e.g. expecting them to do unpaid overtime.

==Origin==
"Take the piss" may be a reference to a related (and dated) idiomatic expression, ''piss-proud'', which is a vulgar pun referring to the [[Nocturnal penile tumescence|morning erections]] which happen when a man awakens at the end of a dream cycle (each about 90 minutes in length throughout the night) or may be caused by a full bladder pressing upon nerves that help affect erection.  This could be considered a 'false' erection, as its origin is physiological not sexual, so in a metaphoric sense, then, someone who is "piss-proud" would suffer from false pride, and ''taking the piss out of them'' refers to deflating this false pride, through disparagement or mockery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A753527 |title=The Origins and Common Usage of British Swear Words |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tak2.htm |title=Take the piss |accessdate=7 January 2011 |last=Quinion |first=Michael |work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge of the expression's metaphoric origin became lost on users, "taking the piss out of" came to be synonymous with disparagement or mockery itself, with less regard to the pride of the subject.

"Take the mickey" may be an abbreviated form of the [[Cockney rhyming slang]] "take the Mickey Bliss",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/344000.html |title=Take the Mickey |accessdate=30 January 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder }}&lt;/ref&gt; a euphemism for "take the piss." It has also been suggested that "mickey" is a contraction of "[[urination|micturition]],"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; in which case "take the micturition" would be a synonymous euphemism for "take the piss." The phrase has been noted since the 1930s.

===Alternative theory of origin===
One theory is that during the [[History of the British canal system|age of the canals]] in Britain, urine would be brought up the canals to the wool mills in Northern England (particularly to Yorkshire), as urine was used in the process of fixing dye to wool. This was particularly the case when dyeing items blue with [[Indigo dye|indigo]] or more traditionally with [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]], before [[synthetic dyes]] were invented or made commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |title=Taking the piss |publisher=Blog.dgwbirch.com |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130027/http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being in the business of transporting urine was much less lucrative than transporting wine, so when the boatmen were questioned what they were carrying they would lie and say "I'm taking wine" and the response would be "No, you're taking the piss" to express disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |title=Dying Art |publisher=History.uk.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051715/http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[Scientific journal|journal]], a [[wiki]], a [[GitHub]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==TEI guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-s.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html|title=Element choice  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation, using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using [[schematron]].

''TEI Lite'' is an  example of such a customization. It defines an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;div type="sonnet"&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s'endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text which might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;p xml:id="p23"&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
  &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
  &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==ODD==

'''One Document Does it all''' ("ODD") is a [[literate programming]] language for [[XML schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Bauman|first1=Syd|last2=Flanders|first2=Julia|contribution=ODD customizations|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Bauman01/EML2004Bauman01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|last2=Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|contribution=RelaxNG with Son of ODD|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Burnard01/EML2004Burnard01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Literate Documentation for XML|last=Reiss|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Digital Humanities 2007|location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois|year=2007|url=http://dhcommons.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/poster_208_reiss.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A complete schema definition language for the Text Encoding Initiative|first1=Lou|last1=Burnard|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|last2=Rahtz|date=June 2013|journal=XML London 2013|doi=10.14337/XMLLondon13.Rahtz01|url=http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/rahtz/|pages=152–161|isbn=978-0-9926471-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the  Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority|technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals ([[Susan Hockey|Hockey]] 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, "P1"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ ach.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historical background", [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).
* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.
* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the [[W3C]] and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.
* '''2011''' TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for [[Genetic editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.1.html |title=P5 version 2.0.1 release notes |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among many other additions the [[Genetic editing]] features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics.)

In art, theme is usually about [[life]], [[society]] or [[human nature]], but can be any other subject. Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work. Themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated. Deep thematic content is not required in a work, but the great majority of works have some kind of thematic content, not always [[Authorial intentionality|intended by the author]]. Analysis of changes (or implied change) in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme.

A theme is not the same as the subject of a work. For example, the ''subject'' of ''[[Star Wars]]'' is "the battle for control of the galaxy between the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and the [[Rebel Alliance]]". The ''themes'' explored in the films might be "moral ambiguity" or "the conflict between technology and nature".

Themes differ from [[motif (visual arts)|motifs in the visual arts]] in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole, while motifs are elements of the content.  In the same way, a literary story with repeated symbolism related to chess does not make the story's theme the similarity of life to chess. Themes arise from the interplay of the plot, the characters, and the attitude the author takes to them, and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors.

'''Planning theory''' is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = How Planners Use Planning Theory| url = http://www.planetizen.com/node/73570/how-planners-use-planning-theory | accessdate = April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that arose as a reaction against the disorder of the [[industrial city]] in the mid-19th century. Urban planning exists in various forms and it addresses many different issues.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., De Jong, H. (2012) ''[http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short Co-evolutions of planning and design]''. [[Planning Theory]] 12(2): 177-192&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning can include [[urban renewal]], by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from decline. Alternatively, it can concern the massive challenges associated with urban growth, particularly in the [[Global South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, the term [[sustainable development]] has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum of all planning goals.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Stephen (2004). "Planning Sustainable and Livable Cities", Routledge; 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blueprint planning ==

Following the rise of empiricism during the industrial revolution, the rational planning movement (1890–1960) emphasized the improvement of the built environment based on key spatial factors. Examples of these factors include: exposure to direct sunlight, movement of vehicular traffic, standardized housing units, and proximity to green-space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=13–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify and design for these spatial factors, rational planning relied on a small group of highly specialized technicians, including architects, urban designers, and engineers. Other, less common, but nonetheless influential groups included governmental officials, private developers, and landscape architects. Through the strategies associated with these professions, the rational planning movement developed a collection of techniques for quantitative assessment, predictive modeling, and design. Due to the high level of training required to grasp these methods, however, rational planning fails to provide an avenue for public participation. In both theory and practice, this shortcoming opened rational planning to claims of elitism and social insensitivity.

Although it can be seen as an extension of the sort of civic pragmatism seen in Oglethorpe's plan for Savannah or William Penn's plan for Philadelphia, the roots of the rational planning movement lie in Britain's Sanitary Movement (1800-1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=13–47, 87–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, advocates such as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] and [[Ebenezer Howard]] argued for central organized, top-down solutions to the problems of industrializing cities. In keeping with the rising power of industry, the source of planning authority in the Sanitary Movement included both traditional governmental offices and private development corporations.  In London and its surrounding suburbs, cooperation between these two entities created a network of new communities clustered around the expanding rail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=48–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best examples of these communities are [[Letchworth]] in Hertfordshire and [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] in Greater London. In both communities, architects [[Raymond Unwin]] and [[Richard Barry Parker]] exemplify the elite, top-down approach associated with the rational planning movement by using the planning process to establish a uniform landscape and architectural style based on an idealized medieval village.

From Britain, the rational planning movement spread out across the world. In areas undergoing industrialization themselves, British influences combined with local movements to create unique reinterpretations of the rational planning process. In Paris, architect [[Le Corbusier]] adopted rational planning's centralized approach and added to it a dedication to quantitative assessment and a love for the automobile. Together, these two factors yielded the influential planning aesthetic known as "Tower in the Park".  In the United States, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] similarly identified vehicular mobility as a principal planning metric. However, where Le Corbusier emphasized design through quantitative assessment of spatial processes, Wright identified the insights of local public technicians as the key design criteria. Wright's [[Broadacre City]] provides a vivid expression of what this landscape might look like.

Throughout both the United States and Europe, the rational planning movement declined in the later half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning Futures: New Directions for Planning Theory|first=Philip|last=Allmendinger|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the movement's decline was also its strength. By focusing so much on design by technical elites, rational planning lost touch with the public it hoped to serve. Key events in this decline in the United States include the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis and the national backlash against urban renewal projects, particularly urban expressway projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transportation: A Geographical Analysis|last=Black|first=William R.|page=29|publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synoptic planning ==
After the “fall” of blueprint planning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the synoptic model began to emerge as a dominant force in planning. Lane (2005) describes synoptic planning as having four central elements:

:"(1) an enhanced emphasis on the specification of goals and targets; (2) an emphasis on quantitative analysis and predication of the environment; (3) a concern to identify and evaluate alternative policy options; and (4) the evaluation of means against ends (page 289)."&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Lane, M. B. (2005). Public Participation in Planning: An Intellectual History. [[Australian Geographer]] , 36 (3), 283–299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public participation]] was first introduced into this model and it was generally integrated into the system process described above. However, the problem was that the idea of a single public interest still dominated attitudes, effectively devaluing the importance of participation because it suggests the idea that the public interest is relatively easy to find and only requires the most minimal form of participation.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Blueprint and synoptic planning both employ what is called the rational paradigm of planning. The rational model is perhaps the most widely accepted model among planning practitioners and scholars, and is considered by many to be the orthodox view of planning. As its name clearly suggests, the goal of the rational model is to make planning as rational and systematic as possible. Proponents of this paradigm would generally come up with a list of steps that the planning process can be at least relatively neatly sorted out into and that planning practitioners should go through in order when setting out to plan in virtually any area. As noted above, this paradigm has clear implications for public involvement in planning decisions.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Participatory planning ==
[[File:Keskustelutilaisuus Helsingin yleiskaavasta.jpg|thumb|A public consultation event about urban planning in Helsinki]]
'''Participatory planning''' is an urban planning [[paradigm]] that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of [[community development]].&lt;ref name="REFALPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/bsf/cppe/cppe.pdf|title= Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation|publisher=IFAD|accessdate=2008-10-21| format=PDF| date=December 2000| last=Lefevre | first=Pierre|last2=Kolsteren|first2=Patrick| last3=De Wael| first3=Marie-Paule | last4=Byekwaso| first4=Francis | last5= Beghin|first5=Ivan|location=Antwerp, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, marginalized groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.&lt;ref&gt;[McTague, C. &amp; Jakubowski, S. Marching to the beat of a silent drum: Wasted consensus-building and failed neighborhood participatory planning. Applied Geography 44, 182–191 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incrementalism ==

Beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critiques of the rational paradigm began to emerge and formed into several different schools of planning thought. The first of these schools is Lindblom’s [[incrementalism]]. Lindblom describes planning as “muddling through” and thought that practical planning required decisions to be made incrementally. This incremental approach meant choosing from small number of policy approaches that can only have a small number consequences and are firmly bounded by reality, constantly adjusting the objectives of the planning process and using multiple analyses and evaluations.&lt;ref name="Linblom"&gt;Lindblom, C. E. (1959). The science of "muddling through". Public Administration Review, 19 (2), 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane (2005) explains the public involvement implications of this philosophy. Though this perspective of planning could be considered a large step forward in that it recognizes that there are number of “public interests” and because it provides room for the planning process to be less centralized and incorporate the voices other than those of planners, it in practice would only allow for the public to be involved in a minimal, more reactive rather than proactive way.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Mixed scanning model ==
The mixed scanning model, developed by Etzioni, takes a similar, but slightly different approach. Etzioni (1968) suggested that organizations plan on two different levels: the tactical and the strategic. He posited that organizations could accomplish this by essentially scanning the environment on multiple levels and then choose different strategies and tactics to address what they found there. While Lindblom’s approach only operated on the functional level Etzioni argued, the mixed scanning approach would allow planning organizations to work on both the functional and more big-picture oriented levels.&lt;ref name="Etzioni"&gt;Etzioni, A. (1968). The active society: a theory of societal and political rocesses. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane explains though, that this model does not do much more at improving public involvement since the planner or planning organization is still at its focus and since its goal is not necessarily to achieve consensus or reconcile differing points of view on a particular subject.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, planners began to look for new approaches because as happened nearly a decade before, it was realized that the current models were not necessarily sufficient. As had happened before, a number of different models emerged. Lane (2005) notes that it is most useful to think of these model as emerging from a social transformation planning tradition as opposed to a social guidance one, so the emphasis is more bottom-up in nature than it is top-down.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Transactive planning ==

Transactive planning was a radical break from previous models. Instead of considering public participation as method that would be used in addition to the normal training planning process, participation was a central goal. For the first time, the public was encouraged to take on an active role in the policy setting process, while the planner took on the role of a distributor of information and a feedback source.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Transactive planning focuses on interpersonal dialogue that develops ideas, which will be turned into action. One of the central goals is mutual learning where the planner gets more information on the community and citizens become more educated about planning issues.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, J. (1973). Retracking America: A Theory of Transactive Planning. Garden City, NJ: Anchor Press/Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy planning ==
Formulated in the 1960s by lawyer and planning scholar [[Paul Davidoff]], the advocacy planning model takes the perspective that there are large inequalities in the political system and in the bargaining process between groups that result in large numbers of people unorganized and unrepresented in the process. It concerns itself with ensuring that all people are equally represented in the planning process by advocating for the interests of the underprivileged and seeking social change.&lt;ref name="Davidoff"&gt;Davidoff, P. (1965). Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning. Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 31 (4), 331–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maziotti"&gt;Mazziotti, D. F. (1982). The underlying assumptions of advocacy planning: pluralism and reform. In C. Paris (Ed.), Critical readings in planning theory (pp. 207–227) New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, public participation is a central tenet of this model. A plurality of public interests is assumed, and the role of planner is essentially the one as a facilitator who either advocates directly for underrepresented groups directly or encourages them to become part of the process.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

==Radical Planning==
Radical planning is a stream of [[urban planning]] which seeks to manage development in an [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] and [[community]]-based manner. The seminal text to the radical planning movement is ''Foundations for a Radical Concept in Planning'' (1973), by [[Stephen Grabow]] and [[Allen Heskin]].  Grabow and Heskin provided a critique of planning as elitist, centralizing and change-resistant, and proposed a new paradigm based upon systems change, decentralization, communal society, facilitation of human development and a consideration of ecology.  Grab ow and He-skin were joined by ''Head of Department of Town Planning'' from the [[Polytechnic of the South Bank]] [[Shean McConnell]], and his 1981 work ''Theories for Planning''.

In 1987 [[John Friedman]] entered the fray with ''Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action'', promoting a radical planning model based on “decolonization”, “democratization”, “self-empowerment” and “reaching out”.  Friedman described this model as an “agropolitan development” paradigm, emphasising the re-localisation of [[primary production]] and [[manufacture]].  In “Toward a Non-[[Euclidean zoning|Euclidian]] Mode of Planning" (1993) Friedman further promoted the urgency of decentralizing planning, advocating a planning paradigm that is normative, innovative, political, transactive and based on a [[Social learning (planning theory)|Social learning]] approach to knowledge and policy.

== Bargaining model ==
The bargaining model views planning as the result of give and take on the part of a number of interests who are all involved in the process. It argues that this bargaining is the best way to conduct planning within the bounds of legal and political institutions.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, G. T. (1989). Rural Land Use Planning Decisions by Bargaining. Journal of Rural Studies, 5 (4), 325–335.&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting part of this theory of planning is that makes public participation the central dynamic in the decision-making process. Decisions are made first and foremost by the public, and the planner plays a more minor role.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Communicative approach ==
{{Main article|Communicative planning}}
The communicative approach to planning is perhaps the most difficult to explain. It focuses on using communication to help different interests in the process understand each other. The idea is that each individual will approach a conversation with his or her own subjective experience in mind and that from that conservation shared goals and possibilities will emerge. Again, participation plays a central role under this model. The model seeks to include as a broad range of voice to enhance the debate and negotiation that is supposed to form the core of actual plan making. In this model, participation is actually fundamental to the planning process happening. Without the involvement of concerned interests there is no planning.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; [[Bent Flyvbjerg]] and Tim Richardson have developed a critique of the communicative approach and an alternative theory based on an understanding of power and how it works in planning.&lt;ref&gt;Flyvbjerg, Bent, 1996, “The Dark Side of Planning: Rationality and ''Realrationalität''”, in Seymour J. Mandelbaum, Luigi Mazza, and Robert W. Burchell, eds., ''Explorations in Planning Theory''. New Brunswick, NJ: Center for Urban Policy Research Press, pp. 383-394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flyvbjerg, Bent and Tim Richardson, 2002, "Planning and Foucault: In Search of the Dark Side of Planning Theory." In Philip Allmendinger and Mark Tewdwr-Jones, eds., ''Planning Futures: New Directions for Planning Theory.'' London and New York: Routledge, pp. 44-62.&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at each of these models it becomes clear that participation is not only shaped by the public in a given area or by the attitude of the planning organization or planners that work for it. In fact, public participation is largely influenced by how planning is defined, how planning problems are defined, the kinds of knowledge that planners choose to employ and how the planning context is set.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Though some might argue that is too difficult to involve the public through transactive, advocacy, bargaining and communicative models because [[transportation]] is some ways more technical than other fields, it is important to note that transportation is perhaps unique among planning fields in that its systems depend on the interaction of a number of individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name="Wachs 2004"&gt;Wachs, M. (2004). Reflections on the planning process. In S. Hansen, &amp; G. Guliano (Eds.), The Geography of Urban Transportation (3rd Edition ed., pp. 141–161). The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ToysRUs.jpg|thumb|[[Blight (urban)|Blight]] may sometimes cause communities to consider redeveloping and urban planning.]]

Prior to 1950, Urban Planning was seldom considered a unique profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Gerald and Gordon, David ''Planning Canadian Communities'' (fifth edition), Nelson College Indigenous, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, and are, of course, differences from country to country. For example, the UK's [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] was created as a professional organisation in 1914 and given a Royal Charter in 1959. Town planning focused on top-down processes by which the [[urban planner]] created the plans. The planner would know architecture, surveying, or engineering, bringing to the town planning process ideals based on these disciplines. They typically worked for national or local governments. Urban planners were seen as generalists, capable of integrating the work of other disciplines into a coherent plan for whole cities or parts of cities. A good example of this kind of planner was [[Lewis Keeble]] and his standard textbook, ''Principles and Practice of Town and Country Planning'', published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Keeble, Lewis B. (1951) ''Principles and Practice of Town and Country Planning'', Estates Gazette, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to the planning process ===

[[Strategic Urban Planning]] over past decades have witnessed the metamorphosis of the role of the urban planner in the planning process. More citizens calling for [[democracy|democratic]] planning &amp; development processes have played a huge role in allowing the [[General public|public]] to make important decisions as part of the planning process. [[Community organizers]] and [[social workers]] are now very involved in planning from the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Forester John. "Planning in the Face of Conflict", 1987, {{ISBN|0-415-27173-8}}, Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term advocacy planning was coined by [[Paul Davidoff]] in his influential 1965 paper, "Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning" which acknowledged the political nature of planning and urged planners to acknowledge that their actions are not value-neutral and encouraged minority and under represented voices to be part of planning decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2007_spring/angotti.htm |title=Advocacy and Community Planning: Past, Present and Future |publisher=Planners Network |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Benveniste|Benveniste]] argued that planners had a political role to play and had to bend some truth to power if their plans were to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniste|first=Guy|title=Mastering the Politics of Planning|year=1994|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Real estate developer|Developers]] have also played huge roles in development, particularly by planning projects. Many recent developments were results of large and small-scale developers who purchased land, designed the district and constructed the development from scratch. The [[Melbourne Docklands]], for example, was largely an initiative pushed by private developers to redevelop the waterfront into a high-end residential and commercial district.

Recent theories of urban planning, espoused, for example by [[Nikos Salingaros|Salingaros]] see the city as an [[adaptive system]] that grows according to process similar to those of [[Plant morphology|plants]]. They say that urban planning should thus take its cues from such natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/lifeandthegeometry.pdf |title="Life and the geometry of the environment", Nikos Salingaros, November 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such theories also advocate participation by inhabitants in the design of the urban environment, as opposed to simply leaving all development to large-scale construction firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/P2PURBANISM.pdf "P2P Urbanism", collection of articles by Nikos Salingaros and others]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of creating an urban plan or [[urban design]], carrier-infill is one mechanism of spatial organization in which the city's figure and ground components are considered separately.  The urban figure, namely buildings, are represented as total possible building volumes, which are left to be designed by architects in following stages.  The urban ground, namely in-between spaces and open areas, are designed to a higher level of detail.  The carrier-infill approach is defined by an urban design performing as the carrying structure that creates the shape and scale of the spaces, including future building volumes that are then infilled by architects' designs.  The contents of the carrier structure may include street pattern, [[landscape architecture]], open space, waterways, and other [[infrastructure]].  The infill structure may contain [[zoning]], [[building code]]s, quality guidelines, and [[Solar Access]] based upon a [[Solar Access#Solar envelope|solar envelope]].&lt;ref&gt;Capeluto, I. G. and Shaviv, E. On the Use of 'Solar Volume' for Determining the Urban Fabric. Solar Energy Vol. 70, No. 3, pp. 275–280, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Nels O. [http://www.nelsonelson.com/DSA-Nelson-renewable-city-report.pdf Planning the Productive City], 2009, accessed December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier-Infill urban design is differentiated from complete urban design, such as in the monumental axis of [[Brasília]], in which the urban design and architecture were created together.

In carrier-infill [[urban design]] or urban planning, the negative space of the city, including landscape, open space, and infrastructure is designed in detail.  The positive space, typically building site for future construction, are only represented as unresolved volumes.  The volumes are representative of the total possible building envelope, which can then be infilled by individual architects.

'''Thermal desorption''' is an [[environmental remediation]] technology that utilizes heat to increase the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of contaminants such that they can be removed (separated) from the solid matrix (typically soil, sludge or filter cake). The volatilized contaminants are then either collected or thermally destroyed. A thermal desorption system therefore has two major components; the desorber itself and the offgas treatment system.
Thermal desorption is not [[incineration]].

==History== 

Thermal desorption first appeared as an environmental treatment technology in 1985 when it was specified in the [[Record of Decision]] for the McKin Company [[Superfund]] site within the [[Royal River]] watershed in Maine.&lt;ref name="McKin"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Site Information McKin Company Superfund Site Gray Maine
  | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency
  | date = 1985-07-22
  | url = http://www.clu-in.org/products/costperf/THRMDESP/Mckin.htm#SITEINFO
  | accessdate = 2009-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently referred to as "low temp" thermal desorption to differentiate it from high temperature incineration. An early direct fired thermal desorption project was the treatment of 8000 tons of toxaphene (a chlorinated pesticide) contaminated sandy soil at the S&amp;S Flying Services site in Marianna Florida in 1990, with later projects exceeding 170,000 tons at the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear]] coal tar site in 1999. A status report from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] shows that thermal desorption has been used at 69 [[Superfund]] sites through FY2000. In addition, hundreds of remediation projects have been completed using thermal desorption at non-Superfund sites.

For [[In situ thermal desorption|in-situ on-site treatment]] options, only [[incinerator|incineration]] and stabilization have been used at more Superfund sites. Incineration suffers from poor public acceptance. Stabilization does not provide a permanent remedy, since the contaminants are still on site. Thermal desorption is a widely accepted technology that provides a permanent solution at an economically competitive cost.

The world’s first large-scale thermal desorption for treatment of mercury containing wastes was erected in Wölsau, for the remediation of the Chemical Factory Marktredwitz (founded in 1788) was considered to be the oldest in Germany. Operation commenced in October 1993 including the first optimising phase. 50,000 tons of mercury-contaminated solid wastes were treated successfully between August 1993 and June 1996. 25 metric tons of mercury had been recovered from soil and rubble. Unfortunately the Marktredwitz plant is often misunderstood in the literature as a pilot-scale plant only.

==Desorbers==
Numerous desorber types are available today. Some of the more common types are listed below.

* Indirect gired rotary
* Direct fired rotary
* Heated screw (hot oil, molten salt, electric)
* Infrared
* Microwave

Most indirect fired rotary systems use an inclined rotating metallic cylinder to heat the feed material. The heat transfer mechanism is usually conduction through the cylinder wall. In this type of system neither the flame nor the products of combustion can contact the feed solids or the offgas. Think of it as a rotating pipe inside a furnace with both ends sticking outside of the furnace. The cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically five to eight feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. With a carbon steel shell, the maximum solids temperature is around 1,000 °F, while temperatures of 1,800 °F with special alloy cylinders are attainable. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 2 to 30 tons per hour for transportable units.

Direct-fired rotary desorbers have been used extensively over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] [[hazardous wastes]] as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 rotary dryer systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing chlorinated organics such as [[solvents]] and [[pesticides]]. The desorbing cylinder for full-scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.

Heated screw systems are also an indirect heated system. Typically they use a jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the heating medium to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter for full-scale systems, with lengths up to 20 feet. The auger/trough assemblies can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.

In the early days, there was a continuous infrared system that is no longer in common use. In theory, microwaves would be an excellent technical choice since uniform and accurately controlled heating can be achieved with no heat transfer surface fouling problems. One can only guess that capital and/or energy costs have prevented the development of a microwave thermal desorber at the commercial scale.

==Offgas treatment==
There are only three basic options for offgas treatment available. The volatilized contaminants in the offgas can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed. In some cases, both a collection and destruction system are employed. In addition to managing the volatilized components, the particulate solids (dust) that exit the desorber must also be removed from the offgas.

When a collection system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense the bulk of the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350–900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense the bulk of the volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.

The condensed liquid from cooling the offgas is separated into organic and aqueous fractions.  The water is either disposed of or used to cool the treated solids and prevent dusting. The condensed liquid organic is removed from the site.  Depending on its composition, the liquid is either recycled as a supplemental fuel or destroyed in a fixed base incinerator.  A thermal desorber removing 500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of organic contaminants from 20,000 tons of soil will produce less than {{Convert|3000|usgal|L}} of liquid organic.  In essence 20,000 tons of contaminated soil could be reduced to less than one tank truck of extracted liquid residue for off-site disposal.

Desorbers using offgas destruction systems use combustion to thermally destroy the volatilized organics components forming [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[NOx]], SOx and [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]. The destruction unit may be called an afterburner, secondary combustion chamber, or thermal oxidizer. Catalytic oxidizers may also be used if the organic halide content of the contaminated media is low enough. Regardless of the name, the destruction unit is used to thermally destroy the hazardous organic constituents that were removed (volatilized) from the soil or waste.

''' Tzippori Synagogue''' ('''Sepphoris Synagogue''') is an ancient synagogue discovered in [[Tzippori]], a Roman-era Jewish city in the [[Galilee]], now an archaeological site and a national park in [[Israel]]. 

==History==
Based on numismatic evidence, the synagogue appears to have been built in the first half of the fifth century. It was located on the northern side of the city, not far from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/Zippori/mosaic.htm The Mosaic Pavements of Roman and Byzantine Zippori]&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring 20.7 meters long and 8 meters wide, it is the narrowest ancient synagogue uncovered in the [[Land of Israel]]. The [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was located in the western wall, not oriented towards Jerusalem as in other synagogues of that era.&lt;ref name=aviam&gt;Mordechai Aviam, ''Ancient Synagogues in the Land of Israel'', Israel Nature and Parks Authority, 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mishna]] describes Tzippori as having had 18 synagogues at the time of the funeral of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] in the late second century CE.&lt;ref name=aviam/&gt;

==Discovery==
The mosaic floor of the ancient synagogue was discovered in 1993 by a crew building a parking lot at the edge of the national archaeological park of Tzippori.&lt;ref name=art&gt;Steven Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a handful of illustrated synagogue mosaics uncovered in Israel. Archaeologist [[Zeev Weiss]], then a graduate student at the Hebrew University, and his teacher, archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] were called to the scene, and Weiss uncovered the floor and its environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23883856/The-Sepphoris-Synagogue-Deciphering-an-Ancient-Message-through-Its-Archaeological-and-SocioHistorical-Contexts|title=The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|date= May 2006|author=Steven Fine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaics==
The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting [[Sarah]]. The next section shows the binding of [[Isaac]]. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. Next, there is a row of three panels depicting the offerings in the [[Temple at Jerusalem]], including the [[Kodashim|"tamid" sacrifice]], the [[showbread]] and the basket of [[first fruits]]. Above this is a depiction of [[Aaron]] offering sacrifices in the [[Tabernacle]]. Above that is another row of three panels, a [[Torah Ark]], depicted as a pedimented building, and an incense shovel representing the incense shovels used in the Temple, flanked by two panels each displaying the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] from the Temple at Jerusalem surrounded by symbols of the Jewish holidays including the [[Lulav]] and [[Shofar]]. The top, or front of the building section of the floor, another row of three panels, shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Weiss, ''The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts''.Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society; Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The largest panel or central sections of the mosaic is laid out as a large square containing a circle within a circle. This shows the Zodiac with Helios driving his chariot. As with the [[Hammat Tiberias Synagogue]] and the [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]], the Zodiac panel at Tzippori features [[Spandrels]] depicting the four seasons.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

{{For|the railroad device|water crane}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|Deep sea water column]]

A '''water column''' is a conceptual column of water from the surface of a sea, river or lake to the bottom sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B.H., Axler, R., Hagley C., Host G., Merrick G., Richards C. (2004). "[http://waterontheweb.org/resources/glossary.html#W Glossary]". ''Water on the Web''. University of Minnesota-Duluth. Retrieved 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptively, the deep sea water column is divided into five parts—''[[pelagic zone]]s'' (from Greek πέλαγος (pélagos), 'open sea')—from the surface to below the floor, as follows: ''[[epipelagic]]'', from the surface to 200 meters below the surface; ''[[mesopelagic]]'', from 200 to 1000 meters below the surface; ''[[bathypelagic]]'', from 1000 to 4000 meters below the surface; ''[[abyssopelagic]]'', from 4000 meters below the surface to the level sea floor; ''[[hadopelagic]]'', depressions and crevices below the level sea floor.

The concept of water column is useful since many aquatic phenomena are explained by the incomplete vertical mixing of chemical, physical or biological parameters.  For example, when studying the metabolism of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]], it is the specific bottom layer concentration of available [[chemical]]s in the water column that is meaningful, rather than the average value of those chemicals throughout the water column. 

Water columns are used chiefly for [[environmental science|environmental studies]] evaluating the [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] or mixing of the thermal or chemically stratified layers in a lake, stream or ocean: for example, by wind-induced currents. Some of the common parameters analyzed in the water column are [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[temperature]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], [[salinity]], [[total dissolved solids]], various [[pesticide]]s, [[pathogen]]s and a wide variety of chemicals and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

The term ''water column'' is also commonly used in [[scuba diving]] to describe the vertical space through which divers ascend and descend.

Physicists often uses various lattices to apply their favorite models in them. For instance, the most favorite lattice is perhaps the square lattice. There are 14 Bravais space lattice where every cell has exactly the same number of nearest, next nearest, nearest of next nearest etc neighbors and hence they are called regular lattice. Often physicists and mathematicians studies phenomena which requires disordered lattice where each cell do not have exactly the same number of neighbors rather the number of neighbors can vary wildly. For instance, if one want to study spread of disease, viruses, rumors etc then the last thing one would look for is the square lattice. In such cases a disordered lattice is necessary. One way of constructing a disordered lattice is by doing the following.

Starting with a square, say of unit area, and dividing randomly at each step only one block, after
picking it preferentially with respect to ares, into four smaller blocks creates '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)'''. Essentially it is a disordered planar lattice as its block size and their coordination number are random.

==Description==
In applied mathematics, a '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)''' is a structure that has properties in common with those of [[lattice (group)|lattices]] and those of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. In general, space-filling planar cellular structures can be useful in a wide variety of seemingly disparate physical and biological systems.
Examples include grain in [[polycrystalline]] structures, cell texture and tissues in biology, acicular texture in [[martensite]] growth, [[tessellated pavement]] on ocean shores, soap froths
and agricultural land division according to ownership etc.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rao, S. Sengupta and H. K. Sahu Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75}, 2164 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ben-Naim and P. L. Krapivsky,
Phys. Rev. Lett. '''76,''' 3234 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The question of how these structures appear and the understanding of their topological and geometrical properties have always been an interesting proposition among scientists in general and physicists in particular.
Several models prescribe how to generate cellular structures. Often these
structures can mimic directly the structures found in nature and they are able to capture the essential properties that we find in natural structures. 
In general, cellular structures appear through random [[tessellation]], tiling, or 
subdivision of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping cells. For instance, [[Voronoi diagram]] and [[Apollonian]] packing are 
formed by partitioning or tiling of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping convex polygons and disks respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Delaney, S. Hutzler and T. Aste,  Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101} 120602 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular planar lattices like square lattices, triangular lattices, honeycomb lattices, etc., are the simplest example of the cellular structure in which every cell has exactly the same size and the same coordination number. The planar [[Voronoi diagram]], on the other hand, has neither a fixed cell size nor a fixed coordination number. Its coordination number distribution is rather [[Poisson distribution|Poissonian]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. de Oliveira, S. G. Alves, S. C. Ferreira, and R. Dickman, "Contact process on a Voronoi triangulation", Phys. Rev. E '''78''' 031133 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the distribution is peaked about the mean where it is almost impossible to find cells which have significantly higher or fewer coordination number than the mean. Recently, Hassan ''et al'' proposed a lattice, namely the weighted planar stochastic lattice. For instance, unlike a network or a graph, it has properties of lattices as its sites are spatially embedded. On the other hand, unlike lattices, its dual (obtained by considering the center of each block of the lattice as node and the common border between blocks as links) display the property of networks as its degree distribution follows a [[power law]]. Besides, unlike regular lattices, the sizes of its cells are not equal; rather, the distribution of the area size of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; whose coordination number distribution follows a power-law.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, “Scale-free network topology and multifractality in a weighted planar stochastic lattice” New Journal of Physics '''12''' 093045 ( 2010) http://doi:10.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093045&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf.

== Construction of WPSLs ==

The construction process of the WPSL can be described as follows. It starts with a square of unit area which we regard as an initiator. The generator then divides the initiator, in the first step, randomly with uniform probability into four smaller blocks. In the second step and thereafter, the generator is applied to only one of the blocks. The question is: How do we pick that block when there is more than one block? The most generic choice would be to pick preferentially according to their areas so that the higher the area the higher the probability to be picked. For instance, in step one, the generator divides the initiator randomly into four smaller blocks. Let us label their areas starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise as &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_4&lt;/math&gt;. But of course the way we label is totally arbitrary and will bear no consequence to the final results of any observable quantities. Note that &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block which can be well regarded as the probability of picking the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block. These probabilities are naturally normalized &lt;math&gt;\sum_i a_i=1&lt;/math&gt; since we choose the area of the initiator equal to one. In step two, we pick one of the four blocks preferentially with respect to their areas. Consider that we pick the block &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and apply the generator onto it to divide it randomly into four smaller blocks. Thus the label &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is now redundant and hence we recycle it to label the top left corner while the rest of three new blocks are labelled  &lt;math&gt;a_5, a_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_7&lt;/math&gt; in a clockwise fashion. In general, in the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th step, we pick one out of &lt;math&gt;3j-2&lt;/math&gt; blocks preferentially with respect to area and divide randomly into four blocks. The detailed algorithm can be found in Dayeen and Hassan&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hassan, Hassan, and Pavel.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of lattice generation can also be described as follows. Consider that the substrate is a square of unit area and at each time step a seed is nucleated from which two orthogonal partitioning lines parallel to the sides of the substrate are grown until intercepted by existing lines. It results in partitioning the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks. Note that the higher the area of a block, the higher is the probability that the seed will be nucleated in it to divide that into four smaller blocks since seeds are sown at random on the substrate. It can also describes kinetics of fragmentation of two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, E. Ben-Naim, "Scaling and multiscaling in models of fragmentation", Phys. Rev. E '''50''' 3502 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, S. Redner and E. Ben_naim, ''A kinetic View of Statistical Physics'' (Cambridge University Press, New York, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inset the same data is plotted on the self-similar coordinates and the data collapse of all the data taken at different times collapse into one universal curve. It reveals that the area size distribution function obeys dynamic scaling.]]

== Properties of WPSLs ==

* The dynamics of the growth of this lattice is governed by infinitely many conservation laws, one of which is the trivial conservation of total area.
* Each of the non-trivial conservation laws can be used as a multifractal measure and hence it is also a multi-multifractal ([[multifractal system]]).
* The area size distribution function of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]].
* It can be mapped as a network if we consider the center of each block as a node and the common border between block as the link between the center of the corresponding nodes. The [[degree distribution]] of the resulting network exhibits power-law ([[scale-free network]]). In 1999 Barabasi and Albert argued that growth and preferential attachment (PA) rule are the two basic ingredients behind power-law degree distribution. In the case of WPSL, presence of one of the ingredients is obvious. What about the PA rule. A closer look at the growth process of the WPSL suggest that a block gain new neighbor only if one of its neighbor is picked and divided. Thus the higher the number of neighbors a block has, the higher is the chances that it will gain more neighbors. In fact, the ([[Mediation-driven attachment model]]) embodies exactly this idea. In this model too PA rule is present but in disguise!
* It exhibits multiscaling.

Before 2000 [[epidemic models]], for instance, were studying by applying them on regular lattices like square lattice assuming that everyone can infect everyone else in the same way.
The emergence of a network-based framework has brought a fundamental change, offering a much much better pragmatic skeleton than any time before. Today epidemic models is one of the most active applications of network science, being used to foresee the spread of influenza or to contain Ebola. The WPSL can be a good candidate for applying epidemic like models since it has the properties 
of graph or network and the properties of traditional lattice as well.

'''World Book Day'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.worldbookday.com/about/| title = What is World Book Day?|publisher =Worldbookday.com| accessdate = 16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''World Book and Copyright Day''' (also known as '''International Day of the Book''' or '''World Book Days''') is a yearly event on April 23rd, organized by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.

==Date selection==
The original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/bookday/ |title=World Book and Copyright Day, 23 April |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same ''date'' — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same ''day'', as at the time, Spain used the [[Gregorian calendar]] and England used the [[Julian calendar]]; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)

Book Day is 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes death, ''[[Don Quixote]]'' is read during a two-day "readathon" and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] is presented by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]] in [[Alcalá de Henares]]. 

In Catalonia, Spain, [[St. George's Day]] has been 'The Day of the Rose' since 1436, and involves the exchange of gifts between loved ones and respected people—it is analogous to [[Valentine's Day]].  Although World Book and Copyright Day has been celebrated since 1995 internationally, books were exchanged on 'The Day of the Rose' in Catalonia since 1929, in memory of Cervantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Sant Jordi et le jour du livre |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |work=Generalitat de Catalunya |date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220195057/http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bcdaef2126896210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall2&amp;contentid=a503ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |archive-date=20 December 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
