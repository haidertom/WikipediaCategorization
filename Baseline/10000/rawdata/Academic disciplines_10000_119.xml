      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">'''Astronomy Visualization Metadata (AVM)''' is a standard for tagging digital astronomical images stored in formats such as [[JPEG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]].&lt;ref name="avm"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php  Astronomy Visualization Metadata Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; The AVM standard extends the concept of [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) headers to include useful astronomical information about the subject of the image as well as the telescope used to take the image. This ensures that relevant information is transferred with the image when it is shared with others. AVM could be considered analogous to the [[FITS]] headers associated with raw astronomical data files. 

The standard was proposed by the Virtual Astronomy Multimedia Project, part of the [[IAU]] Commission 55 and the [[International Virtual Observatory Alliance]]. It reached version 1.1 on May 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_1.1_final_draft.pdf  AVM 1.1 Final Candidate]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is currently used to tag images from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], [[Herschel Space Observatory]], [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], [http://www.spacetelescope.org ESA/Hubble] and the [[European Southern Observatory]].&lt;ref name="usage"&gt;[http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12018/ ESO Images in a Universal Context - Astronomical metadata to provide better access to space images]&lt;/ref&gt; Software packages such as PinpointWCS,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~akapadia/pinpointwcs/   PinpointWCS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811054855/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~akapadia/pinpointwcs/ |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FITS Liberator]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/  FITS Liberator]&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft [[WorldWide Telescope]] have implemented the standard.

The metadata include information about the creator of the image, the content (including description and subject category), the method of observation (including facility, instrument and spectral information), the World Coordinate System (WCS) position in the sky, and the publisher of the image.

AVM was conceived by Robert Hurt, [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]], and Adrienne Gauthier.

==Metadata Categories==
The Astronomy Visualization Metadata standard defines a taxonomy for astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="taxonomy"&gt;[http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_1.1_final_draft.pdf  AVM 1.1 Final Candidate Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt; The main categories are:

# Planet

The '''Blackstone Canal''' was a waterway linking [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] (and Narragansett Bay) through the Blackstone Valley via a series of locks and [[canal]]s during the early 19th century.

==History==

The initiative for the canal came from Providence, where a merchant community wished to profit from trade with the farming country of the Blackstone Valley and Worcester County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachushistory.org/detocqueville-visit-united-states/articles/blackstone-canal-artery-heart-commonwealth| Teachushistory.org|Blackstone Canal-artery-heart of the Commonwealth]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Worcester and the Blackstone Valley, eager for transport that would enable them to get better prices for their produce, welcomed the plan.  However, since the trade of central Massachusetts was at that time going overland through the port of Boston, Massachusetts commercial interests succeeded in stalling the project for several years.  Finally, in 1823, the  Blackstone Canal Company was organized through an act of the Massachusetts legislature, with a Rhode Island company soon following.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112"&gt;Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  The canal's construction may have been motivated by competition among rival industrialists to curtail "[[water rights]]".&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanely Woolen Mill, The Story |publisher=Deaneredevelopment.com |url=http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720070524/http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1825 and cost $750,000 (twice its initial estimate). The canal opened on October 7, 1828 when the [[packet boat]] ''Lady Carrington'' arrived in Worcester, the first vessel to make the trip. The canal brought immediate prosperity to Worcester and the Valley; farmers' profits increased and mills were built, especially in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112" /&gt; Using water to transport goods was a great improvement over the rough roads of the era. At the time of its construction, it represented the best available transportation technology.

It was a two-day trip for the canal boats from Worcester to Providence and another two-day trip to return to Worcester. The overnight stopping point was in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]]. Boston merchants moved to recapture the trade moving down the canal to Providence, opening a rail line to Worcester in 1835.  (Boston merchants opened three railroads in 1835, one to Lowell, one to Worcester, and one to Providence, RI. These were very new technology.) In 1847 the parallel [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] began operation, and the canal closed in 1848.

The canal was 35 feet or more in width. It ascended 451 feet, passing through an original 49 locks. The canal used "slack-water" to bypass narrow valley areas and intersected the Blackstone River 16 times over its 45-mile course. It ran in the river itself for 10% of its length. These portions proved troublesome since in summer, water was sometimes too low for navigation. In other periods, flooding was the problem. Winter added ice to the issues.

Each lock was 70 feet long by 10 feet wide and apparently 4–4.5 feet deep. All, except the wooden tide lock at Providence, were built of granite on a wooden foundation. The average lift of each lock was 9.2 feet, but there were variations.

The canal was engineered by [[Benjamin Wright]] (chief engineer of the [[Erie Canal]]) and Holmes Hutchinson (later Chief Engineer of New York's canals) as they were concluding work on the original Erie Canal. Its locks are therefore similar, although smaller, than the original Erie's.

The canal followed the course of Mill Creek from the center of Worcester, MA to the southern part of that community. It then followed the Blackstone River downstream to Ashton, RI. At Ashton, it paralleled the river's west bank, maintaining elevation until it entered Cranberry and Scotts Ponds on the divide of the watershed with the Moshassuck River. It then locked down into the Moshassuck Valley and followed that stream into Providence, RI.

==The canal today==
Since the canal's closure, parts of its watercourse were filled and other segments are now heavily overgrown with brush and trees. Other sections were converted to hydraulic canals for textile mills. Much of the lock masonry was sold for other purposes. Its remains, however, are still visible in many locations. About 85% of the canal remains. Two long sections of the canal exist in the [[Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park]] in Massachusetts and the [[Blackstone River State Park]] in Rhode Island. Other sections are also publicly owned.

The canal is the subject of several listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The southernmost portion of the canal, between Providence and the Ashton Dam in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island]], was listed in 1971; this list was expanded in 1991 to include the entire Rhode Island section.  A {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} section of the canal in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] and [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]] was listed in 1973; this listing was expanded in 1995 to encompass the entire historic footprint of the canal in Massachusetts.

== Significance ==
The Blackstone Canal is historically significant as a transportation network arising from a canal-building frenzy of the early 19th-century. The canal played a key role in stimulating the industry between Providence and Worcester and the towns and villages along the Moshassuck
and Blackstone Rivers. Though its useful service life was just twenty years long, the canal and the parks incorporating the canal are "visible and tangible parts of the city's and the state's history of growth, planning, commercial ambition and prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/lincoln/linc_blackstone-canal_ronci-park.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places - Blackstone Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7646">'''The chase''' is a simple [[fixed-point iteration|fixed-point algorithm]] testing and enforcing implication of data dependencies in [[database|database systems]]. It plays important roles in [[database theory]] as well as in practice.
It is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered.

The chase has its origins in two seminal papers of 1979, one by [[Alfred V. Aho]], [[Catriel Beeri]], and [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred V. Aho]], [[Catriel Beeri]], and [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]]: "The Theory of Joins in Relational Databases", ACM Trans. Datab. Syst. 4(3):297-314, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other by [[David Maier]], [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], and [[Yehoshua Sagiv]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[David Maier]], [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], and [[Yehoshua Sagiv]]: "Testing Implications of Data Dependencies". ACM Trans. Datab. Syst. 4(4):455-469, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest application the chase is used for testing whether the [[projection (relational algebra)|projection]] of a [[relation schema]] constrained by some [[functional dependency|functional dependencies]] onto a given decomposition can be [[join dependency|recovered by rejoining the projections]]. Let ''t'' be a tuple in &lt;math&gt;\pi_{S_1}(R) \bowtie \pi_{S_2}(R) \bowtie ... \bowtie \pi_{S_k}(R)&lt;/math&gt; where ''R'' is a [[relation (database)|relation]] and ''F'' is a set of functional dependencies (FD). If tuples in ''R'' are represented as ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', the join of the projections of each ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' should agree with ''t'' on &lt;math&gt;\pi_{S_i}(R)&lt;/math&gt; where ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''. If ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not on &lt;math&gt;\pi_{S_i}(R)&lt;/math&gt;, the value is unknown.

The chase can be done by drawing a tableau (which is the same formalism used in [[tableau query]]). Suppose ''R'' has [[attribute (computing)|attributes]] ''A, B, ...'' and components of ''t'' are ''a, b, ...''. For ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' use the same letter as ''t'' in the components that are in S&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; but subscript the letter with ''i'' if the component is not in ''i''. Then, ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will agree with ''t'' if it is in S&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and will have a unique value otherwise.

The chase process is [[confluence (rewriting system)|confluent]].

==Example==
Let ''R''(''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'') be a relation schema known to obey the set of functional dependencies ''F'' = {''A''→''B'', ''B''→''C'', ''CD→A''}. Suppose ''R'' is decomposed into three relation schemas S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {''A'', ''D''}, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {''A'', ''C''} and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {''B'', ''C'', ''D''}. Determining whether this decomposition is lossless can be done by performing a chase as show below.

The initial tableau for this decomposition is:
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''d''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''
|-
| ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|} 
The first row represents S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The components for attributes ''A'' and ''D'' are unsubscripted and those for attributes ''B'' and ''C'' are subscripted with ''i'' = 1. The second and third rows are filled in the same manner with S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.
The goal for this test is to use the given ''F'' to prove that ''t'' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') is really in ''R''. To do so, the tableau can be chased by applying the FD’s in ''F'' to equate symbols in the tableau. Final tableau with a row that is the same as ''t'' implies that any tuple ''t'' in the join of the projections is actually a tuple of ''R''.
&lt;br /&gt;
To perform the chase test, first decompose all FD’s in ''F'' so each FD has a single attribute on the right hand side of the "arrow". ''F'' remains unchanged because all of its FD's already has a single attribute on the right hand side. ''F'' = {''A''→''B'', ''B''→''C'', ''CD''→''A''}.
When equating two symbols, if one of them is unsubscripted, make the other be the same so that the final tableau can have a row that is exactly the same as ''t'' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''). Also, if both have their own subscript, change either to be the other. However, to avoid confusion, all of the occurrences should be changed.
&lt;br&gt;
First, apply ''A''→''B'' to the tableau.
The first row is (''a'', ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d'') where ''a'' is unsubscripted and ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is subscripted with 1. Comparing the first row with the second one, change ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since the third row has ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''b'' in the third row stays the same. The resulting tableau is:
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''d''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''
|-
| ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|}

Then consider ''B''→''C''. Both first and second rows have ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and notice that the second row has an unsubscripted ''c''. Therefore, the first row changes to (''a'', ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''c'', ''d''). Then the resulting tableau is:
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''
|-
| ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|}

Now consider ''CD''→''A''. The first row has an unsubscripted ''c'' and an unsubscripted ''d'', which is the same as in third row. This means that the A value for row one and three must be the same as well. Hence, change ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the third row to ''a''. The resulting tableau is:
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
! ''A'' !! ''B'' !! ''C'' !! ''D''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' || ''c'' || ''d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''
|-
| ''a'' || ''b'' || ''c'' || ''d''
|} 
At this point, notice that the third row is (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') which is the same as ''t''. Therefore, this is the final tableau for the chase test with given ''R'' and ''F''. Hence, whenever ''R'' is projected onto S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and rejoined, the result is in ''R''. Particularly, the resulting tuple is the same as the tuple of ''R'' that is projected onto {''B'', ''C'', ''D''}.

According to the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC's]] 2014 [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|assessment report]], "Mitigation is a public good; climate change is a case of the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. Effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent (individual, institution or country) acts independently in its own selfish interest (see [[International cooperation]] and [[Emissions trading]]), suggesting the need for collective action. Some [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] actions, on the other hand, have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals, regions, or countries that undertake them, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, financing such adaptive activities remains an issue, particularly for poor individuals and countries."&lt;ref name="AR5-WG3-Chap3"&gt;

One of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective of [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|preventing "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human) interference of the climate system]]. As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.

In fact, stabilizing emissions at current levels would result in the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continuing to rise over the 21st century and beyond (see the graphs opposite).

The reason for this is that human activities are adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]] for a complete explanation).&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt; This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere, and how fast the GHGs are removed. Stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on [[#Non-CO2 greenhouse gases|non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; GHGs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2018 an international team of scientist published research saying that the current mitigation policy in [[Paris Agreement]] is insufficient to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees. They say that even if all the current pledges will be accomplished there is a chance for a 4.5 degree temperature rise in decades.  To preventing that, restoration of natural [[Carbon sink]]s, [[Carbon dioxide removal]], changes in society and values will be necessary.&lt;ref name="Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Rockström |first2=Johan |last3=Richardson |first3=Katherine |last4=M.

[[File:Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Production IEA.PNG|right|thumb|"Hydropower-Internalised Costs and Externalised Benefits"; Frans H. Koch; [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA)-Implementing Agreement for Hydropower Technologies and Programmes; 2000.]]

To create lasting climate change mitigation, the replacement of high carbon [[emission intensity]] power sources, such as conventional [[fossil fuel]]s—[[oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]—with [[low-carbon power]] sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf World energy outlook 2012 (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[hydroelectricity]] and [[nuclear power]] together provide the majority of the generated [[low-carbon power]] fraction of global total power consumption.

In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact.

:1. [[Human overpopulation|Not having]] an additional child (58.6 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent emission reductions per year)

:2. Living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

:3. Avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes)

:4. Eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes)

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for “greening” one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the “low-impact” category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc.&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

The researchers added that “Our recommended high-impact actions are more effective than many more commonly discussed options (e.g. eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs). More significantly, a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.”&lt;ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05/&gt;&lt;ref name="PimmJenkins"/&gt;

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction.

====Energy efficiency and conservation====
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|A 230-volt LED light bulb, with an [[Edison screw|E27]] base (10 [[watt]]s, 806 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s).]]

Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called "energy efficiency", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use only 33% of the energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled. As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter, driving less, or working in a less brightly lit room. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand-side switching sources====
Fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 – European Commission |accessdate= 2015-04-29 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511100639/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/roadmap/index_en.htm |archive-date= 2015-05-11 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014038 |issn= 1748-9326 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |page= 014038 |last1= Wei |first1= Max |last2= Nelson |first2= James H |last3= Greenblatt |first3= Jeffery B |last4= Mileva |first4= Ana |last5= Johnston |first5= Josiah |last6= Ting |first6= Michael |last7= Yang |first7= Christopher |last8= Jones |first8= Chris |last9= McMahon |first9= James E |last10= Kammen |first10= Daniel M |title= Deep carbon reductions in California require electrification and integration across economic sectors |journal= Environmental Research Letters |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2013-03-01 |url= http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=1/a=014038?key=crossref.37ef0d9dff3c11bf4c176aa87e4f5831|bibcode= 2013ERL.....8a4038W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Williams |first= James H. |title= The technology path to deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2050: The pivotal role of electricity |journal= Science |volume= 335 |issue= 6064 |pages= 53–9 |accessdate= 2015-03-21 |date= 2012 |url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mz2472z.pdf |bibcode= 2012Sci...335...53W |doi= 10.1126/science.1208365|pmid= 22116030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning [[coal]].&lt;ref name=gasdotorg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |title=Natural Gas and the Environment |publisher=Naturalgas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.

At the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.

The economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/ |title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015 – Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.

Alternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]]. A 2015 study by Energy+Environmental Economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas, electrification, and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= E3 Decarbonizing Pipeline 01-27-2015.pdf |accessdate= 2015-04-14 |url= https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717182053/https://ethree.com/documents/E3_Decarbonizing_Pipeline_01-27-2015.pdf |archive-date= 2015-07-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demand side grid management====
Expanding intermittent electrical sources such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. The [[vehicle-to-grid]] suggestion would use a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

A [[Yale University]] review published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]](LCA) emissions from nuclear power([[light water reactor]]s) determined that: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"/&gt;
While some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future GHG emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the [[enriched uranium|efficiency of enrichment methods]]. In a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development, as it could be effected by a decreasing global [[uranium market]] of average ore grade, the analysis determined that depending on conditions, median life cycle nuclear power GHG emissions could be between 9 and 110&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050, with the latter high figure being derived from a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust" by the authors of the paper, as the "ore grade" in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Warner |first1= E.

Although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present [[Generation II reactor]] technology, the same paper also summarizes the literature on "FBRs"/[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s, of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the [[BN-800 reactor|BN-800]], for these reactors it states that the "median life cycle GHG emissions&amp;nbsp;...

In their 2014 report, the IPCC [[Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions|comparison of energy sources global warming potential per unit of electricity generated]], which notably included [[albedo]] effects, mirror the [[median]] emission value derived from the Warner and Heath Yale [[meta-analysis]] for the more common non-breeding [[light water reactor]]s, a [[carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}-equivalent]] value of 12&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh, which is the lowest global warming forcing of all [[baseload]] power sources, with comparable low carbon power baseload sources, such as hydropower and biomass, producing substantially more global warming forcing 24 and 230&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh respectively.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology – specific cost and performance parameters|url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=1 August 2014|page=10|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616215117/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf|archivedate=16 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases (i.e. {{CO2}} and methane—CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal when burned at power plants, but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain.

A study performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of [[methane emissions]] from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.

A 2011 study&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102222215/http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/report-coal-to-gas-the-influence-of-methane-leakage |archive-date=2015-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by noted climate research scientist, Tom Wigley,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wigley]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that while carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy, it also found that additional methane (CH4) from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in {{CO2}} forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. The study looked at methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced {{CO2}} emissions. When gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0%, and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10%. The overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century, however, are small. Petron et al.

These studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a "cleaner" fuel is questionable.

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction—releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.

It has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain ''et al.'' |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |first1= |display-authors= 1 |last2= et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= ''Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems''.

With significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinks and negative emissions===
{{Main|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. A [[negative carbon dioxide emission]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Almost 20 percent (8{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year) of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from deforestation in 2007. It is estimated that avoided deforestation reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at a rate of 1{{nbsp}}tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per $1–5 in [[opportunity costs]] from lost agriculture. [[Reforestation]] could save at least another 1{{nbsp}}GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year, at an estimated cost of $5–15/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; [[Afforestation]] is where there was previously no forest - such plantations are estimated to have to be prohibitively massive to be reduce emissions by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lena R.

With increased [[intensive agriculture]] and [[urbanization]], there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland. By some estimates, for every half a hectare of original [[old-growth forest]] cut down, more than 20 hectares of new [[secondary forest]]s are growing, even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60% more carbon than these new secondary forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html?pagewanted=all|title=New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=18 July 2016|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, E.

Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth. However, grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and the dying plant would stay in place.&lt;ref name=Tlovell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day a two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130625040133/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|archivedate=June 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when part of leaf matter is consumed by a herding animal, a corresponding amount of root matter is sloughed off too as it would not be able to sustain the previous amount of root matter and while most of the lost root matter would rot and enter the atmosphere, part of the carbon is sequestered into the soil.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt; It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world's 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1% would offset nearly 12 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt; [[Allan Savory]], as part of [[holistic management]], claims that while large herds are often blamed for [[desertification]], prehistoric lands supported large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying.&lt;ref name=ASavory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/|title=How cows could repair the world|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon capture and storage====
[[File:Carbon sequestration-2009-10-07.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic showing both terrestrial and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired plant]]
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The IPCC estimates that the costs of halting global warming would double without CCS.&lt;ref name=guardian0916&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/co2-turned-into-stone-in-iceland-in-climate-change-breakthrough|title=CO2 turned into stone in Iceland in climate change breakthrough|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Energy Agency says CCS is "the most important single new technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; savings" in power generation and industry.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1954176_1954175,00.html |title=How to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Capture and Store it? |publisher=[[Time.com]] |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it requires up to 40% more energy to run a CCS coal power plant than a regular coal plant, CCS could potentially capture about 90% of all the carbon emitted by the plant.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; Norway's [[Sleipner gas field]], beginning in 1996, stores almost a million tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year to avoid penalties in producing natural gas with unusually high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/sleipner.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit/&gt; As of late 2011, the total planned {{CO2}} storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year.

====Enhanced weathering====
Enhanced weathering is the removal of carbon from the air into the earth, enhancing the natural carbon cycle where carbon is mineralized into rock. The [[CarbFix]] project couples with carbon capture and storage in power plants to turn carbon dioxide into stone in a relatively short period of two years, addressing the common concern of leakage in CCS projects. While this project used [[basalt]] rocks, [[olivine]] has also shown promise.&lt;ref name=guardian0916/&gt;

===Geoengineering===
{{Main|Climate engineering}}

Geoengineering is seen by Olivier Sterck as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00635487/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatecentral.org/news/harvard-scientists-taking-geoengineering-into-the-field-21362&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[scientific literature|literature]] assessment, Barker ''et al.'' (2007) described geoengineering as a type of mitigation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Chapter 28 of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] report ''Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'' (1992) defined geoengineering as "options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry."&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1605&amp;page=433 Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base] (1992), [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP)&lt;/ref&gt; They evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions: can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost. They also sought to encourage discussion of a third question&amp;nbsp;— what adverse side effects might there be. The following types of option were examined: reforestation, increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration) and screening out some sunlight. NAS also argued "Engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks.".&lt;ref name="nas_policy_implications"/&gt; In July 2011 a report by the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] on geoengineering found that "[c]limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change."&lt;ref&gt;GAO (2011). Technical status, future directions, and potential responses. July 2011. [http://gao.gov/products/GAO-11-71 GAO-11-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon dioxide removal====
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}
{{See also|Carbon air capture}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&amp;nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly. However, captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to force more [[crude oil]] out of [[oil field]]s, as [[Statoil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] have made plans to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212213143/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2006/03/08/afx2578203.html Statoil, Shell in plan to raise oil output by injecting {{CO2}} – report], [[AFX News]] via [[Forbes]], March 8, 2006, checked 2009-01-15&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can also be used in commercial [[greenhouse]]s, giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology. Some attempts have been made to use [[algae]] to capture [[smokestack]] emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/erc/spotlights/alg-all.html |title=MIT Energy Research Council: Research Spotlight |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the [[GreenFuel Technologies Corporation]], who have now shut down operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/greenfuel-technologies-closing-down-4670/ |title=GreenFuel Technologies Closing Down: Greentech Media |publisher=Greentechmedia.com |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar radiation management====
{{Main|Solar radiation management}}
{{See also|Stratospheric aerosol injection (climate engineering)}}
The main purpose of solar radiation management seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. The ability of stratospheric [[sulfate aerosols]] to create a [[global dimming]] effect has made them a possible candidate for use in [[climate engineering]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/84j11614488142u8/ |journal=Phil.

===Non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not the only GHG relevant to mitigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shindell |first=Drew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/183 |title=Simultaneously Mitigating Near-Term Climate Change and Improving Human Health and Food Security &amp;#124; Science |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other GHGs emitted by human activities ([[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] GHGs). The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These gases are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the [[halocarbon|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic GHGs requires an understanding of their different physical properties. Stabilization depends both on how quickly GHGs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed. The rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG in question (see the [[greenhouse gas#Global warming potential|main GHG article]] for a list). Here, the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the GHG in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37% of its initial amount.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O's lifetime is about 110 years. For methane, a reduction of about 30% below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration, while for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, an emissions reduction of more than 50% would be required.&lt;ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/&gt;

[[Methane]] is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than [[carbon dioxide]] in the amount of heat it can trap, especially in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Methane vs. Carbon Dioxide: A Greenhouse Gas Showdown|url= http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/|website= One Green Planet|accessdate= 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide, indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source.&lt;ref name="usclimatenetwork.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact, as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane. In terms of prevention, vaccines are being developed in Australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from [[methane]] released by livestock via [[flatulence]] and [[eructation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6431 Burp vaccine cuts greenhouse gas emissions] ''Rachel Nowak'' for NewScientist September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical property of the anthropogenic GHGs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat (in the form of [[infrared radiation]]). Some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others, e.g., SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 22,200 times more effective a GHG than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a per-kilogram basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Transport===
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide, and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in North America and Australia. Many citizens of countries like the United States and Canada who drive personal cars often, see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars. Modes of mass transportation such as bus, light rail (metro, subway, etc.), and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers, able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile. Modern [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient technologies]], such as [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline &amp; Jet fuel]] may also help to reduce the consumption of [[petroleum]], land use changes and emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. Utilizing [[rail transport]], especially electric rail, over the far less efficient [[environmental impact of aviation|air transport]] and [[road transport|truck transport]]
significantly reduces emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Urban planning===
{{Main|Urban planning}}

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1982 and 1997, the amount of land consumed for [[urban development]] in the United States increased by 47 percent while the nation's population grew by only 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.&lt;!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.--&gt;

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

For institutions of higher learning in the United States, greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fetcher|first=Ned|title=Effects of climate and institution size on greenhouse gas emissions from colleges and universities in the United States|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=December 2009|volume=2|issue=6|pages=362–67|doi=10.1089/SUS.2009.9820}}&lt;/ref&gt; If climate is not taken into account, annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula, ''E=aS''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' =0.001621 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent/square meter and ''b''= 1.1354.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Colleges and Universities|url=http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|accessdate=2 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106105803/http://www.wilkes.edu/pages/4243.asp|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[hot water heater]]s and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
According to the [[EPA]], agricultural [[soil management]] practices can lead to production and emission of [[nitrous oxide]] (N2O), a major [[greenhouse gas]] and air pollutant. Activities that can contribute to {{chem|N|2|O}} emissions include [[fertilizer]] usage, [[irrigation]], and [[tillage]]. The management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the Agriculture sector. Cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions, through methane emissions. Manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html|title=Agriculture: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions|year=2015|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods that significantly enhance carbon sequestration in soil include [[no-till farming]], residue mulching, [[cover crop]]ping, and [[crop rotation]], all of which are more widely used in [[organic farming]] than in conventional farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/organic.farm.vs.other.ssl.html |title=Organic farming produces same corn and soybean yields as conventional farms, but consumes less energy and no pesticides, study finds |author=Susan S.

A 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life; however, the study also showed that [[conservation farming]] can protect carbon in soils, and repair damage over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eos.org/research-spotlights/conservation-farming-shown-to-protect-carbon-in-soil|title=Conservation Farming Shown to Protect Carbon in Soil|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|authors=A.

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

====Population====

==Costs and benefits==
{{Main|Economics of climate change mitigation}}

===Costs===
The [[Stern Review]] proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e by 2050. The Review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels. The Review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range −1.0 to +3.5% of World [[GDP]], (i.e. [[Gross world product|GWP]]), with an average estimate of approximately 1%.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt; Stern has since revised his estimate to 2% of GWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/26/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Cost of tackling global climate change has doubled, warns Stern |first= Juliette |last=Jowit |first2= Patrick |last2=Wintour |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the Gross World Product (GWP) at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= CIA World Factbook |publisher= US [[CIA]] |date= 18 Oct 2011
|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html
|accessdate= 21 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus 2% is approximately $1.5 trillion. The Review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies. Mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;Stern, N. (2006). ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change: Part III: The Economics of Stabilisation.'' HM Treasury, London: http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.&lt;ref name="stern"/&gt;

===Benefits===

This was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation. By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant [[effects of global warming]]. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced [[adaptive capacity]].

===Sharing===
One of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies. There is no scientific consensus over how to share these costs and benefits (Toth ''et al.'', 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[heating]] to stay tolerably warm. In richer countries, emissions tend to be associated with things like [[car]]s, [[central heating]], etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–105):&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt;
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book
|year=1996

|isbn=978-0-521-56854-8
|doi=10.2277/0521568544|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit from reducing their emissions.
**''Carbon inheritance'':&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the notion that we have inherited the (technological) benefits of past emissions, and those who benefit most from them should pay the most. An energy levy has been suggested as a proxy for technological development. Rather than allocating blame for historical emissions, an energy levy pays back the benefits these technologies have brought&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;106),&lt;ref name=banuri/&gt; for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of renewable energy, and increased energy efficiency. It is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations, where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons. Countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling, if their gas taxes are high, if they do not subsidize the fishing industry, if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita, and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber.

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. On the 11th of December 1997 it was implemented by the 3rd conference of parties, which was coming together in kyoto, which came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that have ratified this protocol]] have committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. For Kyoto reporting, governments are obliged to be told on the present state of the countries forests and the related ongoing processes.

Actions to mitigate climate change are sometimes based on the goal of achieving a particular temperature target. One of the targets that has been suggested is to limit the future increase in global mean temperature (global warming) to below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, relative to the pre-industrial level.&lt;ref name="Jaeger, C.C., and J.

; Views in the literature
There is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2&amp;nbsp;°C target can be met.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, M., ''et al.'', Section 19.7.2: Limits to Mitigation, in: [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FGDall.pdf Chapter 19: Emergent risks and key vulnerabilities] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701114626/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap19_FGDall.pdf July 8 2014]), pp. 49–50, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden/Silke Beck: [http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n9/full/nclimate2309.html ''Renegotiating the global climate stabilization target''.] In: Nature Climate Change, 4, 2014, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Anderson and Bows (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K. &amp; Bows, A., 2011.

Royal Society A.&lt;/ref&gt; "there is little to no chance" of meeting the target. On the other hand, according to Alcamo ''et al.'' (2013):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Policies adopted by parties to the UNFCCC are too weak to meet a 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C target. However, these targets might still be achievable if more stringent mitigation policies are adopted immediately.
*Cost-effective 2&amp;nbsp;°C scenarios project annual global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before the year 2020, with deep cuts in emissions thereafter, leading to a reduction in 2050 of 41% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alcamo|others|2013|pp=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Discussion on other targets
Scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies, such as reducing GHG emissions. However, deciding what policies are best requires value judgements.&lt;ref name="wg 2 ch19 dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, limiting global warming to 1&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"Implication for Carbon Emissions Target," in: {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2013|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1&amp;nbsp;°C limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C limit.&lt;ref&gt;"4.

According to some analysts, the 2&amp;nbsp;°C "guardrail" is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation.&lt;ref name="existing policies inadequate"&gt;*[http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/radical-emission-reduction-conference The Radical Emissions Reduction Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119103001/http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/radical-emission-reduction-conference |date=2017-01-19 }}, 2013.

; Official long-term target of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C
In 2015, two official UNFCCC scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that, "in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5°C".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Encouraging use changes===

====Emissions tax====
{{See also|carbon tax|energy tax|fee and dividend}}

An emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee, charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2010-03-18|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions directly.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

Emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity, and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt; Emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes. In developing countries, institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources.&lt;ref name="gupta emissions tax"/&gt;

====Subsidies====
According to [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100% renewable power by 2030.&lt;ref name="wws-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jacobson |first1= M.Z. |year= 2009 |title= Review of solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy security |url= http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424234910/http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2010-04-24 |format= PDF |journal= Energy and Environmental Science |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–73 |doi= 10.1039/b809990c|citeseerx= 10.1.1.180.4676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson, and his colleague Mark Delucchi, suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour (in 2007 dollars) for wind, about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric, from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal, and 8 cents per kWh for solar, fossil, and nuclear power.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal|last1= [[Mark Z.

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''StoryOfStuff.com'' (2009) [http://storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ "The Story of Cap and Trade"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722034154/http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/ |date=2010-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&amp;nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&amp;nbsp;billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]). A total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged through projects in 2004, a 38% increase relative to 2003 (78 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e).&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/docs/CarbonMarketStudy2005.pdf State and Trends of the Carbon Market] International Emissions Trading Association 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; A lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat. P, Klostermann.J.E.M (unpublished) Institutional governance barriers for the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies, Working paper for the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP) conference "Earth System Governance: People, Places, and the Planet", December 2–4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt; The issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation, such as [[emissions trading|cap and trade]], could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as opposed to one overall enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |title=A Polycentric Approach for Coping with Climate Change |publisher=World Bank |date=October 2009 |author=Elinor Ostrom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164212/http://www10.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/pe/2009/04268.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |series=Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about metal requirement and/or availability for essential decarbonization technoloqies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[nuclear power]], and (plug-in hybrid) [[electric vehicle]]s have also been expressed as obstacles.&lt;ref name="Tokimatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokimatsu|first1=Koji|last2=Wachtmeister|first2=Henrik|last3=McLellan|first3=Benjamin|last4=Davidsson|first4=Simon|last5=Murakami|first5=Shinsuke|last6=Höök|first6=Mikael|last7=Yasuoka|first7=Rieko|last8=Nishio|first8=Masahiro|title=Energy modeling approach to the global energy-mineral nexus: A first look at metal requirements and the 2 °C target|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2017|volume=207|pages=494–509|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence, evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.&lt;ref name="EMJ"&gt;Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E. Y (2004) Climate adaptation planning in practice: an evaluation of adaptation plans from three developed nations, European Management Journal, 22(3) 304–314&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of many of these is supported by GEF agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Report on the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; Many developed countries are implementing 'first generation' institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale.&lt;ref name="EMJ"/&gt; There has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the UNFCCC as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2011) Annual report of the Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States]] include [[energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] which encourage efficiency through programs like [[Energy Star]], [[Commercial Building Integration]], and the [[Industrial Technologies Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/index.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: BestPractices |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 1998, Vice President [[Al Gore]] symbolically signed the Kyoto Protocol, but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ |date=1997-12-11 |title=Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact|work= All Politics|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Transportation Secretary [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], with White House approval, urged governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/25/4099/ "How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law"], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Climate Change Science Program|US Climate Change Science Program]] is a group of about twenty federal agencies and US Cabinet Departments, all working together to address global warming.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming, according to the testimony of the Union of Concerned Scientists to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the US House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012017/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by US scientists pursuant to US law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web |url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-31 |df=}} last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some US scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

In the absence of substantial federal action, state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] in the Northeast and the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/science/earth/in-california-a-grand-experiment-to-rein-in-climate-change.html |work=The New York Times |first=Felicity |last=Barringer |title=In California, a Grand Experiment to Rein in Climate Change |date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&amp;Cr=trade&amp;Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Air travel and shipment====
In 2008, climate scientist [[Kevin Anderson (scientist)|Kevin Anderson]] raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|quote= (esp. slide 24 onward)}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions.

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.&lt;ref name="gossling"&gt;Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009). Hypermobile travellers. and Implications for Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reduction. In: Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions, London. The chapter: ''[https://alicante.academia.edu/documents/0076/1866/chap06_copy.pdf Chapter 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619151427/http://alicante.academia.edu/documents/0076/1866/chap06_copy.pdf |date=2010-06-19}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

On 9 May 2005 [[Jeff Immelt]], the [[chief executive]] of [[General Electric]] (GE), announced plans to reduce GE's global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012. "GE said that given its projected growth, those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7791657/ |title=Green Electric? GE unveils eco-strategy |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2005 a group of leading [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[aerospace]] [[manufacturer]]s pledged to work together to reduce the negative [[environmental impact of aviation]], including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving [[fuel efficiency]] and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels. The group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005, and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union]]'s carbon emission trading scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/747d20ea-e1ff-11d9-bf18-00000e2511c8.html |title=Aviation groups set targets to limit their environmental impact |publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. SRI ([[Socially responsible investing]]) Funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal action===
{{See also|Duty to rescue}}

In some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers. Attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as Palau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/video-paradise-lost/14421/|title=Video: Paradise lost? – Need to Know |publisher=PBS|quote=Palau suing the industrialized countries over global warming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Inuit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ Inuit suing the US in regards to global warming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825135526/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ |date=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as non-governmental organizations such as the Sierra Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|title=Environmental Integrity Project, Sierra Club Announce Plans to Sue EPA Unless It Revises Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Standard, Curbs Nitrous Oxide Pollution Linked to Global Warming – NewsOn6.com – Tulsa, OK – News, Weather, Video and Sports – KOTV.com -|publisher=|access-date=2013-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111204839/http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|archive-date=2016-01-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lorenz (1982): "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"&lt;/ref&gt; methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, 2 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&amp;method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] Ongoing Cases&lt;/ref&gt; and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as [[Urgenda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 January 2004). [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed]. Friends of the Earth Trust. Retrieved May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Exxon]] received a subpoena. According to the ''Washington Post'' and confirmed by the company, the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/exxonmobil-under-investigation-for-misleading-the-public-about-climate-change/ |title=New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consumer-led response to climate change===

Low carbon investment and [[ethical banking]] has been suggested as a tactic to allow consumers to drive a low-carbon transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roughly 5% of OECD disposable income is saved[https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-savings.htm], and could alternately be saved in low-carbon investment funds to substantially increase overall low-carbon investment. 

Voluntarily funded, low-carbon investment funds have been suggested as a way to provide revenue for adaptation costs in the post-fossil fuel era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that voluntary donations can be invested, rather than spent, and long-term returns used to pay for adaptation costs.

A '''codebook''' is a type of document used for gathering and storing codes. Originally codebooks were often literally [[books|&lt;span lang="en-us" dir="ltr"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;]], but today codebook is a byword for the complete record of a series of codes, regardless of physical format.

==Cryptography==
In [[cryptography]], a codebook is a document used for implementing a [[code (cryptography)|code]]. A codebook contains a [[lookup table]] for coding and decoding; each word or phrase has one or more strings which replace it. To decipher messages written in code, corresponding copies of the codebook must be available at either end. The distribution and [[physical security]] of codebooks presents a special difficulty in the use of codes, compared to the secret information used in [[cipher]]s, the [[cryptographic key|key]], which is typically much shorter.

The United States [[National Security Agency]] documents sometimes use ''codebook'' to refer to [[block cipher]]s; compare their use of ''combiner-type algorithm'' to refer to [[stream cipher]]s.

A codebook is usually made in two parts, one part being for converting plaintext to ciphertext, the other for the opposite purpose. Both are usually organized similar to a standard dictionary, with plaintext words (in the first part) and ciphertext words (in the second part) presented like dictionary headwords.

The book used in a [[book cipher]] or the book used in a [[running key cipher]] is generally not a cryptographic codebook.

==Social sciences==
In social sciences, a codebook is a document containing list of codes used in research.

==Data compression==
Codebooks were also used in 19th- and 20th-century [[Commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] for the non-cryptographic purpose of data compression.

'''Cognitive psychology''' is the study of [[mental process]]es such as "[[attention]], language use, [[memory]], [[perception]], problem solving, [[creativity]], and [[thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx |title=American Psychological Association (2013). Glossary of psychological terms |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines such as Cognitive Science and of psychological study, including [[educational psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks. In 387 BCE, [[Plato]] is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=Mangels, J. History of neuroscience |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;Malone, J.C. (2009). ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]). Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M.W. (1990). ''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]].

From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was [[behaviorism]]. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.&lt;ref name="AboutPiaget"&gt;Smith, L. (2000). About Piaget. Retrieved from http://piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. This encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; and it opened an important doorway for [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"&gt;Chomsky, N. A. (1959), ''A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]". Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow &amp; G. A. Austin wrote "a study of thinking" in 1956. In 1960, G. A. Miller, E. Galanter and K. Pribram wrote their famous "Plans and the Structure of Behavior". The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive science.
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences&lt;ref name=Mandler&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Neisser}}[[Ulric Neisser]] put the term "cognitive psychology" into common use through his book ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1967.&lt;ref name=Neisser&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). ''Cognitive Psychology''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]. ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. [[Psychodynamics|Dynamic psychology]], which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.&lt;ref name=Neisser/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mental processes==
{{see also|Cognitive control}}
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Attention===
{{main|Attention}}
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"? |url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key function of [[attention]] is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[Touch|tactile]] information. The brain is able to handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027|pmid=23000534|title=Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=237|pages=107–123|year=2013|last1=Chica|first1=Ana B.|last2=Bartolomeo|first2=Paolo|last3=Lupiáñez|first3=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous control works from bottom-up and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt; Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt;

One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g., participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the [[cocktail party effect]].

Other major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1907229|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|year=1953|last1=Cherry|first1=E. Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while deep processing doesn't occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

===Memory===
The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]].

====[[Working memory]]====
Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to remember information in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|7 plus or minus 2]] is a combination of both memory in working memory and long term memory.

One of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the [[serial position effect]] where information from the beginning and end of list of random words were better recalled than those in the center.&lt;ref name="Eb"&gt;Ebbinghaus, Hermann (1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology. New York: Teachers College.&lt;/ref&gt; This primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list length.&lt;ref name="Eb" /&gt; Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the [[Von Restorff effect]].
[[File:Working-memory-en.svg|thumbnail|The Baddeley &amp; Hitch Model of Working Memory]]
Many models of working memory have been made. One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.

A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]].

====[[Long-term memory]]====
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.&lt;ref name="Balota"&gt;Balota, D.A. &amp; Marsh, E.J. (2004). ''Cognitive Psychology: Key Readings''. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364–365)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly "automatically" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process.&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt; An example is driving a car.
* [[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;
* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception] and the perceptual process]&lt;/ref&gt; Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]] began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness," as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml |title=Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717212235/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eintell/titchener.shtml# |archive-date=2014-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412101520/http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-04-12 |title=University of Connecticut (N.D.). Center for the ecological study of perception |publisher=Ione.psy.uconn.edu |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with [[language]] that dates back to the 1870s, when [[Carl Wernicke]] proposed a model for the mental processing of language.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Christine M. (1990). "Developments and applications of cognitive neuropsychology." In M. W. Eysenck (Ed.)''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Current work on [[language]] within the field of cognitive psychology varies widely. Cognitive psychologists may study [[language acquisition]],&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z|pmid=22707315|title=Language Development and Assessment in the Preschool Period|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=384–401|year=2012|last1=Conti-Ramsden|first1=Gina|last2=Durkin|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual components of [[language]] formation (like [[phoneme]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.4000/cognitextes.211|title=The phoneme in cognitive phonology: Episodic memories of both meaningful and meaningless units?|journal=Cognitextes|issue=2|year=2009|last1=Välimaa-Blum|first1=Riitta}}&lt;/ref&gt; how language use is involved in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpi.nl/departments/other-research/research-projects/language-in-action/subprojects/Mood-and-language-comprehension |title=Berkum, J. Language in action - Mood and language comprehension |publisher=Mpi.nl |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or numerous other related areas.
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumbnail|Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the brain, which are critical in language]]

Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of [[language acquisition]] and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a [[learning disability]]. A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.&lt;ref name="Ramsden" /&gt;

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like:
* How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).
* A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.
* The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=M. E. |year=2006 |title=What is metacognition |journal=The Phi Delta Kappan |volume=87 |issue=9 |pages=696–699 |jstor=20442131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ |title=Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying |publisher=Blog.brainscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html |title=Lovett, M. (2008). Teaching metacognition |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common phenomena related to metacognition include:
*'''[[Déjà Vu]]:''' feeling of a repeated experience
*'''Cryptomnesia:''' generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience, aka unconscious plagiarism.
*'''False Fame Effect:''' non-famous names can be made to be famous
*'''[[illusory truth effect|Validity effect]]:''' statements seem more valid upon repeated exposure
*'''[[Imagination inflation]]:''' imagining an event that did not occur and having increased confidence that it did occur

==Modern==
Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a [[dual process theory]], expounded upon by [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Kahneman&gt;Kahneman D. (2003) "A perspective on judgement and choice." ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.&lt;ref name=Kahneman /&gt;

==Applications==

===Abnormal psychology===
Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |title=University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D |publisher=Med.upenn.edu |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094322/http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |archive-date=2017-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John M. |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ |title=Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.&lt;br&gt;3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T. (1987). ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''. New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social psychology===
Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology.{{Citation needed|reason=The reverse is also true, and the page linked in the next sentence also has a citation needed tag related to the link between social cognition and cognitive psychology.|date=November 2017}} [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as "... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world".&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). ''Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others''. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of multiple [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) models  has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, R.G. (2012). ''The Mind of the Criminal: The Role of Developmental Social Cognition in Criminal Defense Law''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental psychology===
Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W. &amp; Edward, M.J. (2010). The development of theory of mind in early childhood. Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1–6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd, C.J. (1996). "Piaget: A centennial celebration." ''Psychological Science'', 7(4), 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:
* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;Reif, F. (2008). ''Applying Cognitive Science to Education: Thinking and Learning in Scientific and Other Complex Domains''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283–84, b pp. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;
* [[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;

===Personality psychology===
Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., &amp; Davis, D.D. (2004). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==
The line between cognitive psychology and [[cognitive science]] can be blurry. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. &amp; Bernses, O.A. (1989). ''Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European Perspectives'', Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology.

Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through research. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ |title=Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.

==Criticisms==
In the early years of cognitive psychology, [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Changing Minds |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-1-4221-0329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', for example, John Malone writes: "Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with "cognitive psychology", "human cognition", "cognitive science" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain."&amp;#8201;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as [[Naturalistic decision-making|Decision Making]] and [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|Behavioral Science]].

'''''Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament''''' was edited by [[G. K. Beale]] and [[D. A. Carson]], and published by [[Baker Books]] in 2007.

It is a comprehensive [[Bible commentary]] on [[Old Testament]] references within the [[New Testament]]. The editors headed a team of scholars to identify, explain and comment on both the direct quotations within the text of the New Testament and its many other probable allusions to the Old.

In a 2008 interview, Beale explained that the writers [[Eclecticism|eclectically]] extended the [[historical-grammatical method]] of exegesis, seeking a "biblical-theological perspective that really goes beyond the traditional understanding of grammatical-historical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Testaments, One Story|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/februaryweb-only/106-52.0.html?paging=off|accessdate=June 25, 2012|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=February 8, 2008|author=Collin Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The commentary won the 2008 [[Christianity Today]] Award of Merit in Biblical Studies, was finalist in the 2008 Christian Book Award in the Bible and Reference Category, and was named Academic Book of the Year (2008) by the Association of Theological Booksellers.&lt;ref name="wts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wts.edu/stayinformed/view.html?id=395|title=Dr. G.K. Beale, Visiting Professor of NT|date=March 7, 2009|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was the work of a team of Protestant scholars, Catholic apologist [[Scott Hahn]] welcomed the Commentary as "a momentous accomplishment" and "invaluable resource" for Protestants and Catholics alike.

==Availability==
As well as a 1,152-page print edition, the Commentary is available in digital form as an e-book for [[Amazon Kindle]], and as a [[Bible software]] add-on for products including  [[Accordance]], [[Logos Bible Software|Logos]], [[QuickVerse]] and [[WORDsearch]].

'''Computer-mediated communication''' ('''CMC''') is defined as any human communication that occurs through the use of two or more [[Consumer electronics|electronic]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, Denis. (2005). ''Mcquail's Mass Communication Theory''. 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the term has [[traditionally]] referred to those communications that occur via computer-mediated formats (e.g., [[instant messaging]], [[email]], [[chat room]]s, [[online forums]], [[social network service]]s), it has also been applied to  other forms of text-based interaction such as [[text messaging]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, C., Lengel, L. &amp; Tomic, A. (2004). Computer mediated communication: Social interaction and the internet. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on CMC focuses largely on the social effects of different computer-supported communication technologies. Many recent studies involve Internet-based [[social networking]] supported by [[social software]].

== Forms ==

Computer-mediated communication can be broken down into two forms: synchronous and asynchronous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newtechnocomm.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-computer-mediated-communication-in-the-context-of-unimas-students-and-staff/|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Computer Mediated Communication in the Context of UNIMAS Students and Staff|last=Chin|first=Leonora|date=March 5, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication which occurs in real time. All parties are engaged in the communication simultaneously; however, they are not necessarily all in the same location.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Synchronous_vs._Asynchronous|title=Designing Social Interfaces|last=Malone|first=Erin|last2=Gulati|first2=Harjeet S.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of synchronous communication are video chats and FaceTime audio calls. On the contrary, asynchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication which takes place when the parties engaged are not communicating in unison. In other words, the sender does not receive an immediate response from the receiver. Most forms of computer mediated technology are asynchronous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of asynchronous communication are [[Text messaging|text messages]] and [[Email|emails]].

== Scope ==
Scholars from a variety of fields study phenomena that can be described under the umbrella term of computer mediated communication (CMC) (see also [[Internet studies]]). For example, many take a [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociopsychological]] approach to CMC by examining how humans use "computers" (or [[digital media]]) to manage interpersonal interaction, form impressions and  form and maintain relationships.&lt;ref name="Walther96"&gt;Walther, J. B. (1996). Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal interaction. Communication Research, 23, 3-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. B., &amp; [[Burgoon, J. K.]] (1992). Relational communication in computer-mediated interaction. Human Communication Research, 19, 50-88.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have often focused on the differences between online and offline interactions, though contemporary research is moving towards the view that CMC should be studied as embedded in everyday life .&lt;ref&gt;Haythornthwaite, C. and Wellman, B. (2002). The Internet in everyday life: An introduction. In  B. Wellman and C. Haythornthwaite (Eds.), The Internet in Everyday Life (pp. 3-41). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Another branch of CMC research examines the use of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic]] features such as [[emoticon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Skovholt, K., Grønning, A. and Kankaanranta, A. (2014), The Communicative Functions of Emoticons in Workplace E-Mails: :-). Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19: 780–797. {{doi|10.1111/jcc4.12063}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] rules such as [[turn-taking]]&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, A. C., &amp; Jacobs, J. B. (1999). The eyes of the beholder: Understanding the turn-taking system in quasi-synchronous computer-mediated communication. Research on Language &amp; Social Interaction, 32, 337-367.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sequential analysis]] and organization of talk,&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. (1999). Interactional coherence in CMC. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 4(4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. M. (2006). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00106.x/full Computer-mediated conversation: The organization of talk in chat-based virtual team meetings.] Dissertation Abstracts International, 67 (12A), 4388. (UMI No. 3244348)&lt;/ref&gt; and the various [[sociolect]]s, [[Stylistics (linguistics)|styles]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] or sets of terminology specific to these environments (see [[Leet]]). The study of language in these contexts is typically based on text-based forms of CMC, and is sometimes referred to as "computer-mediated discourse analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. C. (2004). Computer-mediated discourse analysis: An approach to researching online behavior. In: S. A. Barab, R. Kling, and J. H. Gray (Eds.), Designing for Virtual Communities in the Service of Learning (pp. 338-376). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way humans communicate in professional, social, and educational settings varies widely, depending upon not only the environment but also the method of communication in which the communication occurs, which in this case is through computers or other information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technology|ICTs]]). The study of communication to achieve [[collaboration]]&amp;mdash;common work products&amp;mdash;is termed [[computer-supported collaboration]] and includes only some of the concerns of other forms of CMC research.

Popular forms of CMC include [[e-mail]], [[Video teleconference|video]], [[voice over IP|audio]] or [[text chat]] (text conferencing including "instant messaging"), [[bulletin board system]]s, [[mailing list|list-servs]] and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]]. These settings are changing rapidly with the development of new technologies.  [[Weblog]]s (blogs) have also become popular, and the exchange of [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] data has better enabled users to each "become their own publisher".

== Characteristics ==
Communication occurring within a computer-mediated format has an effect on many different aspects of an interaction.  Some of those that have received attention in the scholarly literature include impression formation, deception, group dynamics, disclosure reciprocity, disinhibition and especially relationship formation.

CMC is examined and compared to other communication media through a number of aspects thought to be universal to all forms of communication, including (but not limited to) [[synchronicity]], [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]] or "recordability", and [[anonymity]].  The association of these aspects with different forms of communication varies widely. For example, [[instant messaging]] is intrinsically synchronous but not persistent, since one loses all the content when one closes the dialog box unless one has a message log set up or has manually copy-pasted the conversation. E-mail and message boards, on the other hand, are low in synchronicity since response time varies, but high in persistence since messages sent and received are saved. Properties that separate CMC from other media also include transience, its multimodal nature, and its relative lack of governing codes of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, Denis. (2005). Mcquail's Mass Communication Theory. 5th ed. London: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; CMC is able to overcome physical and social limitations of other forms of communication and therefore allow the interaction of people who are not physically sharing the same space.

The medium in which people choose to communicate influences the extent to which people disclose personal information. CMC is marked by higher levels of self-disclosure in conversation as opposed to face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref name="Jiang, C. 2011"&gt;Jiang, C., Bazarova, N., &amp; Hancock, J. (2011). From perception to behavior: Disclosure reciprocity and the intensification of intimacy in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 40, 125-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Self disclosure is any verbal communication of personally relevant information, thought, and feeling which establishes and maintains interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="Jiang, C. 2011"/&gt; This is due in part to visual anonymity and the absence of nonverbal cues which reduce concern for losing positive [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]. According to Walther’s (1996) [[Hyperpersonal model|hyperpersonal communication model]], computer-mediated communication is valuable in providing a better communication and better first impressions.&lt;ref name=Walther96 /&gt; Moreover, Ramirez and Zhang (2007) indicate that computer-mediated communication allows more closeness and attraction between two individuals than a face-to-face communication.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn., R., 2013. Identity Theories and Technology. p.30. East Tennessee State University, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Online impression management, self-disclosure, attentiveness, expressivity, composure and other skills contribute to competence in computer mediated communication.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzberg, B. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00030.x/full "Preliminary Development of a Model and Measure of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) Competence"].&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is a considerable correspondence of skills in computer-mediated and face-to-face interaction &lt;ref&gt;Bubas, G. &amp; Spitzberg, B. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306165733_The_relations_of_communication_skills_in_face-to-face_and_computer-mediated_communication "The relations of communication skills in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication"].&lt;/ref&gt; even though there is great diversity of online communication tools.

Anonymity and in part privacy and security depends more on the context and particular program being used or web page being visited. However, most researchers in the field acknowledge the importance of considering the psychological and social implications of these factors alongside the technical "limitations".

== Language learning ==
{{main|Language learning software}}
CMC is widely discussed in language learning because CMC provides opportunities for language learners to practice their language.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Z. (2006). From Theory to Practice: [[Intracultural]] CMC in the L2 Classroom. book chapter, forthcoming in Ducate, Lara &amp; Nike Arnold (Eds.) Calling on CALL: From Theory and Research to New Directions in Foreign Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Warschauer&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1998). Electronic literacies: Language, culture and power in online education. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted several case studies on using email or discussion boards in different language classes. Warschauer&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2006). Laptops and literacy: learning in the wireless classroom: Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that information and communications technology “bridge the historic divide between speech...and writing”. Thus, considerable concern has arisen over the reading and writing research in [[Second language|L2]] due to the booming of the Internet.

== Benefits ==
The nature of CMC means that it is easy for individuals to engage in communication with others regardless of time or location. CMC allows for individuals to collaborate on projects that would otherwise be impossible due to such factors as geography.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, [http://denvertechnology.blogspot.com/2012/11/advantages-and-disadvantages-of.html "Advantages and Disadvantages of Computer Mediated Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CMC can also be useful for allowing individuals who might be intimidated due to factors like character or disabilities to participate in communication. By allowing an individual to communicate in a location of their choosing, CMC call allow a person to engage in communication with minimal stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, [http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/techno/cmcasset.htm "Computer-Mediated Communication in the Classroom: Asset or Liability?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Making an individual comfortable through CMC also plays a role in self-disclosure, which allows a communicative partner to open up more easily and be more expressive. When communicating through an electronic medium, individuals are less likely to engage in stereotyping and are less self-conscious about physical characteristics. The role that anonymity plays in online communication can also encourage some users to be less defensive and form relationships with others more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, Valkenburg &amp; Peter, [http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111601&amp;article=3 "An Experimental Test of Processes Underlying Self-Disclosure in Computer-Mediated Communication"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
While computer-mediated communication can be beneficial, technological mediation can also inhibit the communication process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/disadvantage-for-communication-in-computer-technology.|title=Disadvantage for Communication in Computer Technology|last=Fennel|first=Zachary|date=|website=Techwalla|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike face-to-face communication, nonverbal cues such as tone and physical gestures, which assist in conveying the message, are lost through computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the message being communicated is more vulnerable to being misunderstood due to a wrong interpretation of tone or word meaning. Moreover, according to Dr. Sobel-Lojeski of Stony Brook University and Professor Westwell of Flinders University, the virtual distance that is fundamental to computer-mediated communication can create a psychological and emotional sense of detachment, which can contribute to sentiments of societal isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/virtual-distance-technology-is-rewriting-the-rulebook-for-human-interaction-38693|title=Virtual distance: technology is rewriting the rulebook for human interaction|last=Sobel-Lojeski|first=Karen|last2=Westwell|first2=Martin|date=May 27, 2016|website=The Conversation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eukaryotic transcription''' is the elaborate process that [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells use to copy genetic information stored in [[DNA]] into units of [[RNA]] replica. Gene transcription occurs in both eukaryotic and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA, RNA polymerase in eukaryotes (including humans) comes in three variations, each encoding a different type of gene. A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus that separates the processes of transcription and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into [[nucleosomes]] and higher order [[chromatin]] structures. The complexity of the eukaryotic genome necessitates a great variety and complexity of gene expression control.

==Overview==
Transcription is the process of copying genetic information stored in a DNA strand into a transportable [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand of RNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=James|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-321-76243-6|edition=7th|author2=Tania A. Baker |author3=Stephen P. Bell |author4=Alexander Gann |author5=Michael Levine |author6=Richard Losik |author7=Stephen C. Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcriptional machinery that catalyzes this complex reaction has at its core three multi-subunit RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcribing RNA that codes for genes that become structural components of the ribosome.
&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

Protein coding genes are transcribed into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that carry the information from DNA to the site of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Although mRNAs possess great diversity, they are not the most abundant RNA species made in the cell. The so-called non-coding RNAs account for the large majority of the transcriptional output of a cell.&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattick|first=J. S.|title=Non-coding RNAs: the architects of eukaryotic complexity|journal=EMBO Reports|date=1 November 2001|volume=2|issue=11|pages=986–991|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve230|pmid=11713189|pmc=1084129}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-coding RNAs perform a variety of important cellular functions.&lt;ref name=Mattick /&gt;

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) catalyses the transcription of all rRNA genes except 5S.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer /&gt; These rRNA genes are organised into a single transcriptional unit and are transcribed into a continuous transcript. This precursor is then processed into three rRNAs: 18S, 5.8S, and 28S. The transcription of rRNA genes takes place in a specialised structure of the nucleus called the nucleolus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sirri|first=Valentina|author2=Silvio Urcuqui-Inchima |author3=Pascal Roussel |author4=Danièle Hernandez-Verdun |title=Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body|journal=Histochem Cell Biol.|year=2008|volume=129|issue=1|pages=13–31|doi=10.1007/s00418-007-0359-6|pmc=2137947|pmid=18046571}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the transcribed rRNAs are combined with proteins to form [[ribosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fromont-Racine|first=Micheline|author2=Senger, Bruno |author3=Saveanu, Cosmin |author4= Fasiolo, Franco |title=Ribosome assembly in eukaryotes|journal=Gene|date=August 2003|volume=313|pages=17–42|doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(03)00629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is responsible for the transcription of all mRNAs, some snRNAs, siRNAs, and all miRNAs.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cramer /&gt; Many Pol II transcripts exist transiently as single strand precursor RNAs (pre-RNAs) that are further processed to generate mature RNAs.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; For example, [[precursor mRNA]]s (pre-mRNAs) are extensively processed before exiting into the [[cytoplasm]] through the [[nuclear pore]] for protein translation.

An identical ω-like subunit (RBP6) is used by all three eukaryotic polymerases, while the same α-like subunits are used by Pol I and III. The three eukaryotic polymerases share four other common subunits among themselves. The remaining subunits are unique to each RNA polymerase.

The [[C-terminus|carboxyl terminal]] domain (CTD) of [[POLR2A|RPB1]], the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, plays an important role in bringing together the machinery necessary for the synthesis and processing of Pol II transcripts.&lt;ref name=corden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corden|first=Jeffry L.|title=RNA Polymerase II C-Terminal Domain: Tethering Transcription to Transcript and Template|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=13 November 2013|volume=113|issue=11|pages=8423–8455|doi=10.1021/cr400158h|pmid=24040939|pmc=3988834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long and structurally disordered, the CTD contains multiple repeats of heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS that are subject to [[phosphorylation]] and other [[posttranslational modification]]s during the transcription cycle. These modifications and their regulation constitute the operational code for the CTD to control transcription initiation, elongation and termination and to couple transcription and RNA processing.&lt;ref name=corden /&gt;

==Initiation==

The initiation of gene transcription in eukaryotes occurs in specific steps.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  First, an RNA polymerase along with general [[transcription factor]]s binds to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the gene to form a closed complex called the [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]]. The subsequent transition of the complex from the closed state to the open state results in the melting or separation of the two DNA strands and the positioning of the template strand to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Without the need of a primer, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of a new RNA chain using the template DNA strand to guide ribonucleotide selection and polymerization chemistry.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; However, many of the initiated syntheses are aborted before the transcripts reach a significant length (~10 nucleotides). During these abortive cycles, the polymerase keeps making and releasing short transcripts until it is able to produce a transcript that surpasses ten nucleotides in length. Once this threshold is attained, RNA polymerase passes the promoter and transcription proceeds to the elongation phase.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Eukaryotic promoters and general transcription factors===
Pol II-transcribed genes contain a region in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) that binds and positions the preinitiation complex. This region is called the core promoter because of its essential role in transcription initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Jennifer|author2=James T. Kadonaga|title=The RNA polymerase II core promoter: a key component in the regulation of gene expression|journal=Genes Dev.|year=2002|volume=16|issue=20|pages=2583–2592|doi=10.1101/gad.1026202|pmid=12381658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhard|first=Boris|author2=Sandelin, Albin |author3=Carninci, Piero |title=Metazoan promoters: emerging characteristics and insights into transcriptional regulation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=6 March 2012|doi=10.1038/nrg3163|pmid=22392219|volume=13|pages=233–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different classes of sequence elements are found in the promoters. For example, the [[TATA box]] is the highly conserved DNA recognition sequence for the TATA box binding protein, [[TATA Binding Protein|TBP]], whose binding initiates transcription complex assembly at many genes.

Eukaryotic genes also contain regulatory sequences beyond the core promoter. These [[Cis-regulatory element|cis-acting control elements]] bind transcriptional activators or repressors to increase or decrease transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized regulatory elements include [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], [[Silencer (DNA)|silencers]], and [[Insulator (genetics)|insulators]]. These regulatory sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

General transcription factors are a group of proteins involved in transcription initiation and regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These factors typically have DNA-binding domains that bind specific sequence elements of the core promoter and help recruit RNA polymerase to the transcriptional start site.
General transcription factors for RNA polymerase II include [[Transcription factor II D|TFIID]], [[Transcription factor II A|TFIIA]], [[Transcription factor II B|TFIIB]], [[Transcription factor II F|TFIIF]], [[Transcription factor II E|TFIIE]], and [[Transcription factor II H|TFIIH]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orphanides|first=G|author2=Lagrange, T |author3=Reinberg, D |title=The general transcription factors of RNA polymerase II.|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 November 1996|volume=10|issue=21|pages=2657–2683|doi=10.1101/gad.10.21.2657|pmid=8946909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROEDER|first=R|title=The role of general initiation factors in transcription by RNA polymerase II|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=327–335|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly of preinitiation complex===
To prepare for transcription, a complete set of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase need to be assembled at the core promoter to form the ~2 million dalton preinitiation complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yuan|author2=Jie Fang |author3=Dylan J. Taatjes |author4=Eva Nogales |title=Structural visualization of key steps in human transcription initiation|journal=Nature|date=28 March 2013|volume=495|pages=481–486|doi=10.1038/nature11991 |pmid=23446344 |pmc=3612373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, for promoters that contain a TATA box near the TSS, the recognition of TATA box by the TBP subunit of TFIID initiates the assembly of a transcription complex. The next proteins to enter are TFIIA and TFIIB, which stabilize the DNA-TFIID complex and recruit Pol II in association with TFIIF and additional transcription factors. TFIIF serves as the bridge between the TATA-bound TBP and polymerase. One of the last transcription factors to be recruited to the preinitiation complex is TFIIH, which plays an important role in promoter melting and escape.&lt;ref name=holstege /&gt;

[[Image:Preinitiation complex.png|thumb|right|200px|The diagram describes the eukaryotic preinitiation complex which includes the general transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II. Credit: [[commons:User:ArneLH|ArneLH]].]]

===Promoter melting and open complex formation===
For pol II-transcribed genes, and unlike bacterial RNA polymerase, promoter melting requires hydrolysis of ATP and is mediated by TFIIH.&lt;ref name=holstege&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holstege|first=F. C.P.|title=Three transitions in the RNA polymerase II transcription complex during initiation|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=15 December 1997|volume=16|issue=24|pages=7468–7480|doi=10.1093/emboj/16.24.7468|pmid=9405375|pmc=1170346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFIIH is a ten-subunit protein, including both [[ATPase]] and [[protein kinase]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SVEJSTRUP|first=J|author2=VICHI, P |author3=EGLY, J |title=The multiple roles of transcription/repair factor TFIIH|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1996|volume=21|issue=9|pages=346–350|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(96)10046-3|pmid=8870499}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the upstream promoter DNA is held in a fixed position by TFIID, TFIIH pulls downstream double-stranded DNA into the cleft of the polymerase, driving the separation of DNA strands and the transition of the preinitiation complex from the closed to open state. TFIIB aids in open complex formation by binding the melted DNA and stabilizing the [[transcription bubble
]].

===Abortive initiation===
{{Main|Abortive initiation}}
Once the initiation complex is open, the first ribonucleotide is brought into the active site to initiate the polymerization reaction in the absence of a primer.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This generates a nascent RNA chain that forms a hetero-duplex with the template DNA strand. However, before entering the elongation phase, polymerase may terminate prematurely and release a short, truncated transcript. This process is called abortive initiation.&lt;ref name=revyakin /&gt; Many cycles of abortive initiation may occur before the transcript grows to sufficient length to promote polymerase escape from the promoter. Throughout abortive initiation cycles, RNA polymerase remains bound to the promoter and pulls downstream DNA into its catalytic cleft in a scrunching-kind of motion.&lt;ref name=revyakin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR |title=Abortive Initiation and Productive Initiation by RNA Polymerase Involve DNA Scrunching|journal=Science|date=17 November 2006|volume=314|issue=5802|pages=1139–1143|doi=10.1126/science.1131398|pmid=17110577|pmc=2754787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoter escape===
When a transcript attains the threshold length of ten nucleotides, it enters the RNA exit channel.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The polymerase breaks its interactions with the promoter elements and any regulatory proteins associated with the initiation complex that it no longer needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Arik|title=Promoter escape by RNA polymerase II|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression|date=September 2002|volume=1577|issue=2|pages=208–223|doi=10.1016/S0167-4781(02)00453-0|pmid=12213653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter escape in eukaryotes requires ATP hydrolysis and, in the case of Pol II-phosphorylation of the CTD. Meanwhile, the transcription bubble collapses down to 12-14 nucleotides, providing kinetic energy required for the escape.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Elongation==
After escaping the promoter and shedding most of the transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for the next phase of transcription: elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pokholok|first=Dmitry K|author2=Hannett, Nancy M |author3=Young, Richard A |title=Exchange of RNA Polymerase II Initiation and Elongation Factors during Gene Expression In Vivo|journal=Molecular Cell|date=April 2002|volume=9|issue=4|pages=799–809|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wade|first=Joseph T|author2=Struhl, Kevin|title=The transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=130–136|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.12.008|pmc=2563432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcription elongation is a [[Processivity|processive]] process. Double stranded DNA that enters from the front of the enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for RNA synthesis. For every DNA [[base pair]] separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the trailing end of the transcription bubble while the single strand RNA emerges alone.

===Elongation factors===
Among the proteins recruited to polymerase are elongation factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Abbie|author2=Core, Leighton J. |author3=Lis, John T. |title=Breaking barriers to transcription elongation|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=August 2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=557–567|doi=10.1038/nrm1981|pmid=16936696}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different classes of elongation factors. Some factors can increase the overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arndt|first=Karen|author2=Caroline Kane|title=Running with RNA polymerase: eukaryotic transcript elongation|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=1 October 2003|volume=19|issue=10|pages=543–550|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2003.08.008|pmid=14550628}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elongation factors, [[P-TEFb]], is particularly important.&lt;ref name=bres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brès|first=Vanessa|author2=Yoh, Sunnie M |author3=Jones, Katherine A |title=The multi-tasking P-TEFb complex|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=June 2008|volume=20|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.04.008|pmc=2628440}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit [[Five prime cap|5'-capping]] enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.&lt;ref name=bres /&gt;

===Transcription fidelity===
Transcription fidelity is achieved through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct [[nucleoside triphosphate]] (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding base in the DNA is admitted to the active center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westover|first=Kenneth D.|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription|journal=Cell|date=November 2004|volume=119|issue=4|pages=481–489|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dong|author2=Bushnell, David A. |author3=Westover, Kenneth D. |author4=Kaplan, Craig D. |author5= Kornberg, Roger D. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription: Role of the Trigger Loop in Substrate Specificity and Catalysis|journal=Cell|date=December 2006|volume=127|issue=5|pages=941–954|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.023 |pmid=17129781 |pmc=1876690}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The former removes the incorrectly inserted ribonucleotide by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=D.|author2=Bushnell, D.

===Pausing, poising, and backtracking===
Transcription elongation is not a smooth ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes for long periods of time before resuming transcription.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter.&lt;ref name=Adelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelman|first=Karen|author2=Lis, John T.|title=Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=18 September 2012|volume=13|issue=10|pages=720–731|doi=10.1038/nrg3293|pmc=3552498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Missra|first=A.|author2=Gilmour, D. S.|title=Interactions between DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor), NELF (negative elongation factor), and the Drosophila RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=4 June 2010|volume=107|issue=25|pages=11301–11306|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000681107|pmid=20534440|pmc=2895096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===RNA processing===
Elongating polymerase is associated with a set of protein factors required for various types of RNA processing.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the RNA splicing machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for [[Polyadenylation|3’-polyadenylation]], the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

==Termination==
The last stage of transcription is termination, which leads to the dissociation of the complete transcript and the release of RNA polymerase from the template DNA.The process differs for each of the three RNA polymerases.&lt;ref name="Richard_rnap"/&gt; 
The mechanism of termination is the least understood of the three transcription stages.

===Factor-dependent===
The termination of transcription of pre-rRNA genes by polymerase Pol I is performed by a system that needs a specific transcription termination factor.&lt;ref name="Lodish 7th" /&gt; The mechanism used bears some resemblance to the rho-dependent termination in prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancey|first=Suzanne|title=DNA transcription|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=41|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-transcription-426|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of ribosomal DNA repeats, sometimes distributed over multiple chromosomes. Termination of transcription occurs in the ribosomal intergenic spacer region that contains several transcription termination sites upstream of a Pol I pausing site. Through a yet unknown mechanism, the 3’-end of the transcript is cleaved, generating a large primary rRNA molecule that is further processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs.

As Pol II reaches the end of a gene, two protein complexes carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.&lt;br /&gt;
 
In the process of terminating transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richard|first=P.|author2=Manley, J. L.|title=Transcription termination by nuclear RNA polymerases|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 June 2009|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1247–1269|doi=10.1101/gad.1792809|pmc=2763537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex.&lt;ref name=Suz-nature /&gt;&lt;ref name=RNAPII&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosonina|first=E.|title=Terminating the transcript: breaking up is hard to do|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=1 May 2006|volume=20|issue=9|pages=1050–1056|doi=10.1101/gad.1431606|pmid=16651651}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.&lt;ref name=RNAPII /&gt;

===Factor-independent===
RNA polymerase III can terminate transcription efficiently without the involvement of additional factors. The Pol III termination signal consists of a stretch of [[thymine]]s (on the nontemplate strand) located within 40bp downstream from the 3' end of mature RNAs.&lt;ref name=Richard_rnap /&gt; The poly-T termination signal pauses Pol III and causes it to backtrack to the nearest [[Hairpin loop|RNA hairpin]] to become a “dead-end” complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=S.|author2=Yuzenkova, Y. |author3=Zenkin, N. |title=Mechanism of Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase III Transcription Termination|journal=Science|date=27 June 2013|volume=340|issue=6140|pages=1577–1580|doi=10.1126/science.1237934|pmc=3760304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of termination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epshtein|first=Vitaly|author2=Cardinale, Christopher J. |author3=Ruckenstein, Andrei E. |author4=Borukhov, Sergei |author5= Nudler, Evgeny |title=An Allosteric Path to Transcription Termination|journal=Molecular Cell|date=December 2007|volume=28|issue=6|pages=991–1001|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RNA hairpin allosterically opens Pol III and causes the elongation complex to disintegrate. The extensive structure embedded in the Pol III-transcript thus is responsible for the factor-independent release of Pol III at the end of a gene. RNA-duplex-dependent termination is an ancient mechanism that dates back to the last universal common ancestor.

==Eukaryotic transcriptional control==
The [[regulation of gene expression]] in eukaryotes is achieved through the interaction of several levels of control that acts both locally to turn on or off individual genes in response to a specific cellular need and globally to maintain a chromatin-wide gene expression pattern that shapes cell identity.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shandilya|first=J|author2=Robert SG|title=The transcription cycle in eukaryotes: from productive initiation to RNA polymerase II recycling|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta|year=2012|volume=1819|issue=5|pages=391–400|doi=10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.01.010|pmid=22306664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because eukaryotic genome is wrapped around [[histone]]s to form nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structures, the substrates for transcriptional machinery are in general partially concealed.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Without regulatory proteins, many genes are expressed at low level or not expressed at all. Transcription requires displacement of the positioned nucleosomes to enable the transcriptional machinery to gain access of the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulaeva|first=Olga|author2=Daria Gaykalova |author3=Vasily M. Studitsky |title=Transcription Through Chromatin by RNA polymerase II: Histone Displacement and Exchange|journal=Mutat. Res.|year=2007|volume=618|issue=1–2|pages=116–129|doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.05.040|pmc=1924643|pmid=17313961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All steps in the transcription are subject to some degree of regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Transcription initiation in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for the cell. Transcription initiation is regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific [[trans-acting factor]]s that act as activators or repressors.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Gene transcription can also be regulated post-initiation by targeting the movement of the elongating polymerase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterlin|first=BM|author2=DH Price|title=Controlling the elongation phase of transcription with P-TEFb|journal=Molecular Cell|year=2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=297–305|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2006.06.014|pmid=16885020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global control and epigenetic regulation===
{{main|Epigenetic regulation}}

The eukaryotic genome is organized into a compact chromatin structure that allows only regulated access to DNA. The chromatin structure can be globally "open" and more transcriptionally permissive, or globally "condensed" and transcriptionally inactive. The former ([[euchromatin]]) is lightly packed and rich in genes under active transcription. The latter ([[heterochromatin]]) includes gene-poor regions such as [[telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s but also regions  with normal gene density but transcriptionally silenced. Transcription can be silenced by [[histone modification]] ([[Histone deacetylase|deaceltylation]] and [[Histone methylation|methylation]]), [[RNA interference]], and/or [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bannister|first=Andrew J. |author2=Kouzarides, Tony |title=Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications |journal=Cell Research |date=15 February 2011 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=381–395 |doi=10.1038/cr.2011.22 |pmid=21321607 |pmc=3193420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gene expression patterns that define cell identity are inherited through cell division.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; This process is called [[epigenetic regulation]]. DNA methylation is reliably inherited through the action of maintenance methylases that modify the nascent DNA strand generated by replication.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is the primary marker of transcriptionally silenced regions. Specialized proteins can recognize the marker and recruit [[histone deacetylases]] and methylases to re-establish the silencing. Nucleosome histone modifications could also be inherited during cell division, however, it is not clear whether it can work independently without the direction by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

===Gene-specific activation===
The two main tasks of transcription initiation are to provide RNA polymerase with an access to the promoter and to assemble general transcription factors with polymerase into a transcription initiation complex. Diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter have been identified.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Eukaryotic genes have acquired extensive regulatory sequences that encompass a large number of regulator-binding sites and spread overall kilobases (sometimes hundreds of kilobases) from the promoter–-both upstream and downstream.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The regulator binding sites are often clustered together into units called enhancers. Enhancers can facilitate highly cooperative action of several transcription factors (which constitute [[enhanceosome]]s). Remote enhancers allow transcription regulation at a distance. Insulators situated between enhancers and promoters help define the genes that an enhancer can or cannot influence.

Eukaryotic transcriptional activators have separate DNA-binding and activating functions.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors needed by the transcriptional machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin in the vicinity of the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the transcriptional machinery, or by helping each other bind to their DNA sites.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate transcriptional responses to address cellular needs.

===Gene-specific repression ===
Eukaryotic transcription repressors share some of the mechanisms used by their prokaryotic counterparts. For example, by binding to a site on DNA that overlaps with the binding site of an activator, a repressor can inhibit binding of the activator. But more frequently, eukaryotic repressors inhibit the function of an activator by masking its activating domain, preventing its nuclear localization, promoting its degradation, or inactivating it through chemical modifications.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressors can directly inhibit transcription initiation by binding to a site upstream of a promoter and interacting with the transcriptional machinery. Repressors can indirectly repress transcription by recruiting histone modifiers (deacetylases and methylases) or nucleosome remodeling enzymes that affect the accessibility of the DNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Repressing histone and DNA modifications are also the basis of transcriptional silencing that can spread along the chromatin and switch off multiple genes.&lt;ref name=Brownbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Terrance A.|title=Genomes|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Liss.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-25046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elongation and termination control===
The elongation phase starts once assembly of the elongation complex has been completed, and progresses until a termination sequence is encountered.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The post-initiation movement of RNA polymerase is the target of another class of important regulatory mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional activator [[Tat (HIV)|Tat]] affects elongation rather than initiation during its regulation of [[HIV]] transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kao|first=Shaw-Yi|author2=Andrew Calman |author3=Paul Luciw |author4=Matija Peterlin |title=Anti-termination of transcription within the long terminal repeat of HIV-1 by tat gene product|journal=Nature|date=3 December 1987|volume=330|pages=489–493|doi=10.1038/330489a0|issue=6147 |pmid=2825027}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many eukaryotic genes are regulated by releasing a block to transcription elongation called promoter-proximal pausing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lis|first=J|title=Promoter-associated Pausing in Promoter Architecture and Postinitiation Transcriptional Regulation|journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol|year=1998|volume=63|pages=347–56|doi=10.1101/sqb.1998.63.347|pmid=10384299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausing can influence chromatin structure at promoters to facilitate gene activity and lead to rapid or synchronous transcriptional responses when cells are exposed to an activation signal.&lt;ref name=Adelman /&gt; Pausing is associated with the binding of two negative elongation factors, DSIF (SPT4/SPT5) and NELF, to the elongation complex. Other factors can also influence the stability and duration of the paused polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cheng B, Li T, Rahl PB, Adamson TE, Loudas NB, Guo J, Varzavand K, Cooper JJ, Hu X, Gnatt A, Young RA, Price DH |title=Functional Association of Gdown1 with RNA Polymerase II Poised on Human Genes|journal=Molecular Cell|date=January 2012|volume=45|issue=1|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2011.10.022|pmid=22244331|pmc=3259526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pause release is triggered by the recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase.&lt;ref name=Peterlin /&gt;

Transcription termination has also emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation. Termination is coupled with the efficient recycling of polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feige|first=MJ|author2=LM Hendershot|title=Disulfide bonds in ER protein folding and homeostasis|journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=167–75|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.10.012|pmid=21144725|pmc=3078216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation.

==Transcription-coupled DNA repair==
When transcription is arrested by the presence of a [[Molecular lesion|lesion]] in the transcribed strand of a gene, [[DNA repair]] proteins are recruited to the stalled RNA polymerase to initiate a process called transcription-coupled repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MELLON|first=I|title=Selective removal of transcription-blocking DNA damage from the transcribed strand of the mammalian DHFR gene|journal=Cell|date=October 1987|volume=51|issue=2|pages=241–249|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90151-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this process is the general transcription factor TFIIH that has ATPase activity. TFIIH causes a conformational change in the polymerase, to expose the transcription bubble trapped inside, in order for the DNA repair enzymes to gain access to the lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarker|first=Altaf H.|author2=Tsutakawa, Susan E. |author3=Kostek, Seth |author4=Ng, Cliff |author5=Shin, David S. |author6=Peris, Marian |author7=Campeau, Eric |author8=Tainer, John A. |author9=Nogales, Eva |author10= Cooper, Priscilla K. |title=Recognition of RNA Polymerase II and Transcription Bubbles by XPG, CSB, and TFIIH: Insights for Transcription-Coupled Repair and Cockayne Syndrome|journal=Molecular Cell|date=October 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=187–198|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2005.09.022|pmid=16246722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, RNA polymerase serves as damage-sensing protein in the cell to target repair enzymes to genes that are being actively transcribed.

==Comparisons between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription==
Eukaryotic transcription is more complex than [[Bacterial transcription|prokaryotic transcription]]. For instance, in eukaryotes the genetic material (DNA), and therefore transcription, is primarily localized to the nucleus, where it is separated from the cytoplasm (in which translation occurs) by the nuclear membrane. This allows for the temporal regulation of gene expression through the sequestration of the RNA in the nucleus, and allows for selective transport of mature RNAs to the cytoplasm. Bacteria do not have a distinct nucleus that separates DNA from ribosome and mRNA is translated into protein as soon as it is transcribed. The coupling between the two processes provides an important mechanism for prokaryotic gene regulation.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

At the level of initiation, RNA polymerase in prokaryotes (bacteria in particular) binds strongly to the promoter region and initiates a high basal rate of transcription. No ATP hydrolysis is needed for the close-to-open transition, promoter melting is driven by binding reactions that favor the melted conformation. Chromatin greatly impedes transcription in eukaryotes. Assembly of large multi-protein preinitiation complex is required for promoter-specific initiation. Promoter melting in eukaryotes requires hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, eukaryotic RNA polymerases exhibit a low basal rate of transcription initiation.&lt;ref name=Brownbook /&gt;

==Regulation of transcription in cancer==
{{main|Regulation of transcription in cancer}}

In vertebrates, the majority of gene [[Promoter (genetics)#CpG islands in promoters|promoters]] contain a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]] with numerous [[CpG site]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16432200"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saxonov S, Berg P, Brutlag DL |title=A genome-wide analysis of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome distinguishes two distinct classes of promoters |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=1412–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16432200 |pmc=1345710 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510310103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When many of a gene's promoter CpG sites are [[DNA methylation|methylated]] the gene becomes silenced.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 [[Somatic evolution in cancer#Glossary|driver]] mutations and 33 to 66 [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] or passenger mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23539594"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW |title=Cancer genome landscapes |journal=Science |volume=339 |issue=6127 |pages=1546–58 |year=2013 |pmid=23539594 |pmc=3749880 |doi=10.1126/science.1235122 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer.  For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms, such as altered expression of [[MicroRNA#DNA repair and cancer|microRNAs]].&lt;ref name="pmid24616890"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tessitore A, Cicciarelli G, Del Vecchio F, Gaggiano A, Verzella D, Fischietti M, Vecchiotti D, Capece D, Zazzeroni F, Alesse E |title=MicroRNAs in the DNA Damage/Repair Network and Cancer |journal=Int J Genom |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=820248 |year=2014 |pmid=24616890 |pmc=3926391 |doi=10.1155/2014/820248 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of [[BRCA1]] may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see [[BRCA1#Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers|Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers]]).

The '''Fisheries Research and Development Corporation''' (FRDC) is a statutory authority that manages research and development investment by the [[Australian Government]] and the Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Investing for tomorrow's fish: the FRDC's research, development and extension plan 2010–2015 | year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9808007-1-5 | publisher=FRDC |url = http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/RDE_plan_2010-2015_final.pdf |location=Canberra |p=i }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

The FRDC is one of fifteen Australian rural research and development corporations managing investment by the [[Australian Government]] and primary industries that during the past 25 years has been crucial to the doubling of the productivity of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rural R&amp;D corporations |url=http://www.ruralrdc.com.au/Page/Home.aspx |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception in 1992, the Corporation's major focus was on research concerning the management of commercial wild-catch fisheries and, to a lesser extent, aquaculture. Since then, the scope has widened greatly to encompass economic, environmental and social aspects of the entire fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors – that is, the recreational and indigenous customary sectors in addition to the commercial wild-catch and aquaculture sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=4}} The Corporation’s strategic investments in research, development and extension activities benefit all its stakeholders (listed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Fisheries Research and Development Corporation annual report 2012–2013 | date=2013| url = http://frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Annual_Report/FRDC_Annual_Report_2013.pdf | publisher=FRDC |location=Canberra |p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FRDC is unique among the corporations in balancing its investment between natural resource management and industry productivity and development. Therefore, a significant proportion of funding is directed at research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=17}}

In fulfilling its role of planning, investing in and managing fisheries research, development and extension (RD&amp;E) activities in Australia, the FRDC provides leadership and coordination of the monitoring, evaluating and reporting on RD&amp;E activities and facilitates the dissemination, extension and commercialisation of research results to end-users. The FRDC achieves this through coordinating investment by government and industry, and involving stakeholders to set and address RD&amp;E priorities. The FRDC also monitors and evaluates the adoption of RD&amp;E outputs to inform future decisions.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=ix}}

== Governance ==

Formed as a statutory corporation on 2 July 1991 under the provisions of the ''Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989'' (the PIERD Act), the FRDC is responsible to the [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)]].

A Chairman and a board of directors govern the FRDC; the Executive Director leads the corporation’s business activities on a day-to-day basis. The board oversees corporate governance, sets strategic direction and monitors the ongoing performance of the Corporation and the Executive Director. The board and the Executive Director are responsible for managing and evaluating the Corporation and its investments, and for reporting to government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors. During 2012-13 the focus for the FRDC Board was on:
* implementing the National Framework for Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension
* developing strategic investment options to ensure delivery of outcomes against the FRDC RD&amp;E Plan
* responding to findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the rural research and development corporations and the Rural Research and Development Council’s National Strategic Investment Plan
* developing a plan to improve the perception of the fishing and aquaculture through making research results more publicly available and addressing factually incorrect media (and similar) reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= FRDC annual operational plan 2012–13 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/AOP-2012-13.pdf |location=Canberra |p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRDC supports a network of Research Advisory Committees (RACs) located in each state and the Northern Territory. The RACs have an extremely important role in maximising the efficiency of the FRDC's planning and funding process.
== Investment ==

=== Revenue sources ===

[[File:Entrance to Fisheries Research House, Canberra, Australia.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Canberra, Australia]]
The primary revenue for the FRDC comes from the Australian Government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, based on:

* the Australian Government providing unmatched funds equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of Australian fisheries production (AGVP);
* fishers and [[aquaculturist]]s providing contributions of at least 0.25 per cent of AGVP; and
* the Australian Government matching contributions by fishers and aquaculturists up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of AGVP.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

The Corporation also manages significant contributions by stakeholders in FRDC-funded projects. 
The FRDC’s strategic investments in RD&amp;E activities benefit the three sectors of fishing: commercial (wild catch and aquaculture), recreational and indigenous customary.
The FRDC has a significant responsibility in ensuring, on behalf of the Australian Government, that research is undertaken to assist in the management of the fisheries and aquaculture resource for ongoing sustainability. A significant proportion of funding is therefore directed to research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

===Investment strategy===
The FRDC invests in RD&amp;E across the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, and for the benefit of both recreational and indigenous customary fishers. The FRDC seeks to achieve maximum leverage from its investment by providing research administration and services using a value-adding model in which research projects are tailored to deliver a specific outcome and are actively managed and monitored. 
The FRDC commissions RD&amp;E through a variety of flexible investment approaches, including an open call for project applications; formal partnership agreements with industry sectors; subprograms and coordination programs that are tailored to a specific industry sector or activity; short-term tactical research investment; and specifically targeted commissioned RD&amp;E, especially where there is market failure by private investment.
The focus for FRDC investment aligns with the following 14 themes, as outlined in the Corporation’s 2010-2015 Strategic RD&amp;E Plan.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=8}} The investment balance between themes, which may vary depending on strategic needs, is reported in each annual report.{{sfn| FRDC annual report 2012–2013 | p=9}}

== Relationships with stakeholders ==
In developing projects addressing the Corporation’s five programs, strategic directions are established in association with the FRDC’s stakeholders, which are:
* the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors
* the federal, state and territory governments (including their fisheries managers and other natural resource managers)
* research partners (including universities, fisheries research organisations, industry and private sector research providers, and investors)
* the people of Australia (on whose behalf aquatic natural resources are managed, and as consumers).{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=5}}

The FRDC works with its partners to undertake program management effectively, to disseminate the results, and to assist with their adoption and, when appropriate, commercialisation.

=== Stakeholder research priorities ===

One of the primary challenges for the FRDC is to gain a solid understanding of the needs and priorities of its stakeholders, many of whom come from a diverse range of sectors and operations. There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&amp;E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&amp;E Strategy and the Corporation’s RD&amp;E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs. Where possible, industry and fisheries management are directly engaged and integrated into the delivery of each project.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Australian Government priorities===
The federal [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]], the [[Abbott Ministry|Parliamentary Secretary]] and the [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]] set priorities that the Corporation is required to address. In 2009 the Australian Primary Industries Ministerial Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mincos.gov.au/pages/background.aspx Primary Industries Ministerial Council]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a “statement of intent” to implement a ''National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework''  through 14 primary industry sectors and 7 cross-industry sectors. Within the framework, each industry sector and cross-sectoral issue was to be assessed for its RD&amp;E capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework|url=http://www.npirdef.org/strategies|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As its contribution to the framework, the FRDC and its stakeholders developed a landmark document setting out future directions for fishing and aquaculture RD&amp;E: the ''National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010 |url=http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/National_RDandE_Strategy_for_Fishing_and_Aquaculture.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultation and collaboration==

===Australian Fisheries Management Forum===
The Australian Fisheries Management Forum comprises the heads of the federal, state and territory government agencies responsible for management of fisheries, who discuss strategic issues relating to fisheries and aquaculture management. The FRDC works with the forum, sitting as an invited representative to meetings, providing advice and ensuring forum priorities are incorporated into the Corporation’s RD&amp;E planning processes.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Representative organisations===

Four representative organisations have been appointed under the PIERD Act, with which the FRDC consults and reports formally at their annual general meetings:
* Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Industry Confederation Inc. (trading as Recfish Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[http://recfishaustralia.org.au Recfish Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Aquaculture Council Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.org.au National Aquaculture Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonwealth Fisheries Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comfish.com.au Commonwealth Fisheries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Levy organisation: Australian Prawn Farmers Association===

The FRDC administers a research and development levy on behalf of the Australian Prawn Farmers Association (APFA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; a levy organisation, which has a leading role with FRDC in ensuring its priorities are met. FRDC investments in prawn farming research and development is driven by the APFA’s RD&amp;E Plan. The two entities enjoy a very close working relationship. The APFA has nominated that the majority of its investment is to be through co-investment with the Australian Seafood CRC.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=15}}

===Industry sector bodies===
The FRDC also has a close relationship with the National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance represents the commercial fishing, pearling and aquaculture industries through state industry councils and peak sector associations to build on the partnerships established with individual industry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

The FRDC also invests in, and partners, entities such as Southern Rocklobster Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernrocklobster.com Southern Rocklobster Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbtia.com.au Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsga.com.au Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Pearl Producers Association, Australian Prawn Farmers’ Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abfa.org.au/index.html Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Other rural research and development corporations===
The FRDC joins with other rural research and development corporations – at the project level and more broadly in functional areas – on a range of activities to enhance joint strategic outcomes. Most significant are climate change projects, evaluation of RD&amp;E, and the “Appetite for Excellence” primary producers tour – a competition for chefs, waiters and restaurateurs. The FRDC is a member of the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations, participating in meetings of R&amp;D corporations' executive directors, business managers and communications managers. The FRDC also provides advice and services in project management and the FRDC-developed project management software, OmniFish.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Industry development===
The FRDC works with various entities to develop the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors in such matters as market development; strengthening trade and market access; developing standards, e.g. for responsible fishing; standardising names for Australian fish; developing quality management systems; and reaching agreement on sustainability. To that end, in 2001 the Corporation and a now defunct peak body of the commercial sector incorporated a not-for-profit company, Seafood Services Australia Ltd, with the mission “to enhance the profitability, international competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of the Australian seafood industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Evolution of the FRDC to 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/Evolution_of_the_FRDC_Sep_2012.pdf |location=Canberra |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry development activities suffered a setback in 2013, when the company ceased trading after "a significant reduction in the availability of funding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seafood Services Australia closes its doors|url=https://seafood.net.au|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre===
The FRDC initiated, and is a core participant in, the Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodcrc.com Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's research program aims to increase the profitability and value of the Australian seafood industry, increase access to premium markets and increase demand for Australian seafood – priorities aligned with the FRDC’s RD&amp;E programs, in particular Program 2: Industry.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

==Research partners==
In any given year, the Corporation has under management about 300 active projects. Investment in research is the FRDC’s core business. As a result, it is vital to the FRDC’s success that it has excellent relationships with its research partners. The key research partners are:
* [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]]
* [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]]
* state fisheries research centres
* [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]
* universities
* [[Cooperative Research Centre]]s
* other rural research and development corporations and companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruralrdc.com.au Rural research and development corporations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* industry groups
* co-investors from the private sector.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

== The Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors ==

The fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors is one of the most complex of Australia’s primary industries in terms of both its structure and the natural resources on which it depends. Most of the industry’s business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:
* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers
* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors
* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&amp;E plan, 2010|p=13}}
Legislatively, the "fishing industry" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as "any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products".

The commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008–09. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.
In 2009–10, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008–09, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009–10.
Demand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood’s prominent role in a healthy diet. In Asian markets consumption is also increasing with the growth of the middle class, especially in China and India. This will place demands on the supply of the limited resource, leading to increases in price.
Currently Australia’s commercial seafood production only provides about 28 per cent of domestic demand. In part because of the rising value of the Australian dollar, the commercial sector is now re-orienting towards better serving the Australian market. Increasingly, value chains will encompass both domestic and imported product. Other factors, such as further improvements in fisheries management and better utilisation of catch, will also be important in meeting domestic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=ABARES | title= Australian fisheries statistics 2010 | date=2011| url =http://data.daff.gov.au/brs/data/warehouse/pe_abares20110830.01/AustFishStats_2010.pdf | publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences |location=Canberra |pp=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not only seafood for consumption that the Australian industry produces. Pearls are a high value consumer item that is produced at the highest level of quality through advanced technology and environmental credentials, making it one of Australia’s most valuable and sustainable fishing sectors.

A '''frame story''' (also known as a '''frame tale''' or '''frame narrative''') is a [[literary technique]] that sometimes serves as a companion piece to a [[story within a story]], whereby an introductory or main narrative is presented, at least in part, for the purpose of setting the stage either for a more emphasized second narrative or for a set of shorter stories. The frame story leads readers from a first story into another, smaller one (or several ones) within it. The frame story may also be used to allow readers to understand a part of the story, then jump to another part that can now be understood. This is not however, to be mixed up with a narrative structure or character personality change.

== Origins ==
Some of the earliest known frame stories are those from ancient Egypt, including one found in the [[Papyrus Westcar]], the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]'', and ''[[The Eloquent Peasant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orality and Literacy in the Demotic Tales|page=27-32, 211-212|last1=Jay|first1=Jacqueline E.|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004323070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples are from [[Indian literature]], including the [[Indian epic poetry|Sanskrit epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Panchatantra]]'', [[Syntipas]]'s ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Wise Masters]]'', and the [[fable]] collections ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael E. J. Witzel |first=Michael E. J. |last=Witzel |chapter=On the origin of the literary device of the 'Frame Story' in Old Indian literature |title=Hinduismus und Buddhismus, Festschrift für U. Schneider |editor-first=H. |editor-last=Falk |location=Freiburg |year=1987 |pages=380–414 |isbn=3-925270-01-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form gradually spread west through the centuries and became popular, giving rise to such classic frame tale collections as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), ''[[The Decameron]]'', and ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.  This format had flexibility in that various narrators could retain the stories they liked or understood, while dropping ones they didn't and adding new ones they heard from other places.  This occurred particularly with ''One Thousand and One Nights'', where different versions over the centuries have included different stories.

The use of a frame story in which a single narrative is set in the context of the telling of a story is also a technique with a long history, dating back at least to the beginning section of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the narrator [[Odysseus]] tells of his wandering in the court of King [[Alcinous]].

== A set of stories ==

This [[literary device]] acts as a convenient [[conceit]] for the organization of a set of smaller narratives, which are either of the devising of the author or taken from a previous stock of popular tales, slightly altered by the author for the purpose of the longer narrative. Sometimes a story within the main narrative can be used to sum up or encapsulate some aspect of the framing story, in which case it is referred to in literary criticism by the French term ''[[mise en abyme]]''.

A typical example of a frame story is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which the character [[Shahrazad]] narrates a set of [[fairy tale]]s to the Sultan [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahriyar]] over many nights. Many of Shahrazad's tales are also frame stories, such as ''[[Sindbad the Sailor|Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman]]'', a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

Extensive use of this device is found in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', where the stories nest several deep, to allow the inclusion of many different tales in one work. [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' uses this literary device to tell the story of Heathcliff and Catherine, along with the subplots. Her sister [[Anne Brontë|Anne]] also uses this device in her [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]''. The main heroine's diary is framed by the narrator's story and letters.

[[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is another good example of a book with multiple framed narratives. In the book, Robert Walton writes letters to his sister describing the story told to him by [[Victor Frankenstein]]; Frankenstein's story contains the creature's story; the [[Frankenstein's monster|creature's]] story even briefly contains the story of a family among whom it had been living.

Frame stories have also appeared in other media, such as [[comic book]]s. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' featured a story arc called ''Worlds End'' which consisted of frame stories, and sometimes even featured stories within stories within stories.

Frame stories are often organized as a gathering of people in one place for the exchange of stories. Each character tells his or her tale, and the frame tale progresses in that manner. Historically famous frame stories include [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', about a group of pilgrims who tell stories on their journey to Canterbury; and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' about a group of young aristocrats escaping the Black Death in the countryside and spending the time telling stories.

[[File:QuidorRipVanWinkle.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''The Return of [[Rip Van Winkle]]'', painting by [[John Quidor]], 1849]]
Sometimes only one storyteller exists, and in this case there might be different levels of distance between the reader and author. In this mode, the frame tale can become more fuzzy. In [[Washington Irving]]'s ''Sketch Book'', which contains "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" and "[[Rip Van Winkle]]" among others, the conceit is that the author of the book is not Irving, but a certain gentleman named Crayon. Here the frame includes the world of the imagined Crayon, his stories, and the possible{{clarify|date=June 2016}} reader who is assumed to play along and "know" who Crayon is.

[[Donald Westlake]]'s short story "No Story" is a parody of frame stories, in which a series of narrators start to tell stories, each of which contains a narrator who starts to tell a story, culminating in a narrator who announces that there will be no story. Essentially, it is a frame story without a story to be framed.

== Single story ==

When there is a single story, the frame story is used for other purposes&amp;nbsp;– chiefly to position the reader's attitude toward the tale.  One common one is to draw attention to the [[Unreliable narrator|narrator's unreliability]].  By explicitly making the narrator a character within the frame story, the writer distances him or herself from the narrator; she or he may also characterize the narrator to cast doubt on the narrator's truthfulness. In [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s stories of [[Mr Mulliner]],  Mulliner is made a [[Fly fishing|fly fisherman]] in order to cast doubt on the outrageous stories he tells.  The movie ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' is framed as a story an old [[Antonio Salieri]] tells to a young priest, because the movie is based more on stories Salieri told about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] than on historical fact. 

Another use is a form of [[procatalepsis]], where the writer puts the readers' possible reactions to the story in the characters listening to it.  In  ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' the frame of a grandfather reading the story to his reluctant grandson puts the cynical reaction a viewer might have to the romantic fairytale into the story in the grandson's persona, and helps defuse it.  This is the use when the frame tells a story that lacks a strong [[narrative hook]] in its opening; the narrator can engage the reader's interest by telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand later actions, thereby identifying the reader's wondering whether the story is worth reading to the listeners'. Such an approach was used by Edith Wharton in her novella [[Ethan Frome]], in which a nameless narrator hears from many characters in the town of Starkfield about the main character Ethan's story.

A specialized form of the frame is a [[dream vision]], where the narrator claims to have gone to sleep, dreamed the events of the story, and then awoken to tell the tale.  In medieval Europe, this was a common device, used to indicate that the events included are fictional; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used it in ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'' (the last also containing a multi-story frame story within the dream).  In modern usage, it is sometimes used in works of [[fantasy]] as a means toward [[suspension of disbelief]] about the marvels depicted in the story.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" complained of such devices as unwillingness to treat the genre seriously.  [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' stories (''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'') includes such a frame, but unlike most usages, the stories themselves use dream-like logic and sequences; most dream frames frame stories that appear exactly as if occurring in real life. The writer [[John Bunyan]] used a dream device in the Christian allegory [[Pilgrim's Progress]] and its sequel, explaining that they were dreams he had while he was in prison and felt God wanted him to write down. This worked because it made what might have been seen as a fantasy something more realistic and meaningful to others who believed as he did.

Still, even when the story proceeds realistically, the dream frame casts doubt on the events.  In the book, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the events really occur; the dream frame added for [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|the movie]] detracts from the validity of the fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven Swann |last=Jones |title=The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-8057-0950-9 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=qkfYAAAAMAAJ |pages=94 }} |page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
As with all [[conceit|literary conceits]], the frame tale has many variations, some clearly within the confines of the conceit, some on the border, and some pushing the boundaries of understanding.  The main goal of a frame tale is as a conceit which can adequately collect otherwise disparate tales. It has been mostly replaced, in modern literature, by the short story collection or anthology absent of any authorial conceit and other rhetorical devices.

To be a frame narrative, the story must act primarily as an occasion for the telling of other stories.  If the framing narrative has primary or equal interest, then it is not usually a frame narrative.  For example, [[Odysseus]] narrates much of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' to the [[Scheria|Phaeacians]], but, even though this recollection forms a great part of the poem, the events after and before the interpolated recollection are of greater interest than the memory.

Another notable example that plays with frame narrative is the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.  Most of the film is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the park bench.  However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest gets up and leaves the bench, and we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son.  This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny's dialogues.

This approach is also demonstrated in the 2008 film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (adapted from the 2005 novel ''[[Q &amp; A (novel)|Q &amp; A]]''), about a poor street kid Jamal coming close to winning ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'' (the [[India]]n version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'') and then being suspected of cheating. Most of the story is narrated at a police station by Jamal, who narrates how he knew the answers to the questions as the show is played back on video. The show itself then serves as another [[framing device]], as Jamal sees [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of his past as each question is asked. The last portion of the film then unfolds without any narrator.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' demonstrates a narrator telling a story, while the protagonist is quoted so as to give the framed appearance that he is telling the story. The narrator provides the transition to the one speaking the story.

A famous literary example is Emily Brontë's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', whereby we learn events through a visitor to the house of the title, who in turn has been told these events by the housekeeper of the Linton family. None of the main characters ever directly narrates.

Another example is [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] 2004 novel [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]], which is a frame story inside a frame story inside a frame story – and so on.  There are six stories in all, each framed inside the other, forming a [[chiastic structure]] to a [[Catharsis|semi-cathartic]] tale spanning centuries of narrative.

Frame stories are found in many [[role-playing video game]]s, such as the early ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]'', released in 1990. This literary device can also be sparingly used to achieve secondary ends. For instance, the ''[[Shining Force]]'' series of role playing games use narrators within frame stories to implement things like starting, saving and exiting the game without breaking the [[fourth wall]] entirely, or rather by constructing a second fourth wall to shield the player from having to suspend his/her disbelief as much. A similar approach was used in the [[open world]] video game ''[[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven]]'', where the game's missions are presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by Tommy Angelo, as he confesses his involvement with an [[American Mafia]] family. Another example of frame stories in video games is the game [[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]. Catherine's first scene is a frame story.

In the game ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'', the Kid's actions are narrated by one of the other characters, Rucks, as he tells the Kid's story to another character while the Kid is in the final area. Because Rucks never learns about the Kid's actions explicitly, the narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to keep the fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.

Another example is ''[[Persona 5]]'', which begins ''[[in medias res]]'' and is largely framed around Sae Niijima's interrogation of the protagonist, henceforth referred to by his [[code name]] "Joker" since the character's proper name is player-defined. During the story, Niijima introduces the audience to antagonists the Phantom Thieves have targeted, and whenever a Confidant besides Niijima (who cuts a deal with Joker during the interrogation) or the Velvet Room residents is unlocked, she will press Joker for information on accomplices and skills. Whenever a new party member is introduced, Niijima will press Joker on how he knew them, reacting with horror at the point in the game when her younger sister Makoto becomes a Phantom Thief. Should the player fail to complete a Palace by its deadline, the resulting [[game over]] is framed as a [[truth serum]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] Joker is suffering from preventing him from recalling events correctly and a mysterious man - heavily implied and later confirmed to be a traitor to the Phantom Thieves - murdering him in cold blood while Niijima leaves to allow him to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Persona 5]]|developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]], [[Deep Silver]] |date= April 4, 2017|platform= [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]]|level = Police Station|quote = '''Sae Niijima''': ...Is that the entirety of your testimony? *sigh* Do you have no intention of saying anything more? Or is the overdose affecting your memory...? In any case, it seems it'd be a waste of time to speak to you any longer. It's unfortunate. ''[Soon after Niijima has left, a mysterious man holds Joker at gunpoint]''/'''Mysterious Man''': ...Allow me to enlighten you. That trivial righteousness that you've paraded around...? This is how such idiocy ends. ''[shoots Joker in the head, killing him instantly]'' ...Farewell.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a more minor memory problem caused by the truth serum overdose is used to avoid revealing the traitor's identity too early. The device is dropped once the in-game calendar reaches the day of the interrogation, as the prologue leads into the interrogation and the main conflict is still far from resolved by this date.

== Compared to reprise ==
{{See also|Reprise}}

In musical [[sonata form]] or [[rondo]], a theme occurs at the beginning and end of the work, or returns periodically. This could most simply be a recurrence or restatement of a melody or song. For example, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]" works as a framing device for their [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], appearing at the beginning and end of the album. Other albums with similar devices include Paul McCartney &amp; [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' ''[[Band on the Run]]'', the recurring heartbeats in [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''   and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' ("[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]"), [[Supertramp]]'s ''[[Crime of the Century (album)|Crime of the Century]]'' (the harmonica riff at the beginning of "School" is reprised at the end of the title track), and [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]]'s ''[[Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]]'' ("You have the world at your fingertips/No one can make it better than you"). Another is Junior Senior's 'D-D-D-Don't Stop The Beat' album which ends with a reprise of the first notes from the opening track. The closing track of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' is a reprise of the opening track "[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight]]."

A reprise may be expressed in narrative: at the beginning and the end of the movie ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character shoots the noose to save his partner from hanging.

At the beginning of the 1992 movie ''[[Far and Away]]'', the father "dies" and then returns to life briefly. The same thing happens in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' where Tom Cruise's character "dies" and then comes back to life.

Framing devices may also take the form of a recurrent element that appears at the beginning and the end of the narrative. For example, a story may begin with a character visiting a park under one set of circumstances, then returning at the end to the same park under a different set of circumstances, having undergone a change that allows him or her to see the park in a new light.
 
A framing device might also simply be a defining image of the narrative or art that is used at the beginning and end of the work. 

An example of this is in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' which begins and ends with the characters running along a beach, accompanied at both times by the movie’s famous theme music. This scene, although chronologically occurring in the middle of the film and unimportant to the straightforward plot, serves to convey a defining emotion and tone that sets the context for the main story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7651">A '''fuzzy set operation''' is an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] on [[fuzzy sets]].  These operations are generalization of [[crisp set]] operations. There is more than one possible generalization.  The most widely used operations are called ''standard fuzzy set operations''.  There are three operations:  [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy complements|fuzzy complement]]s, [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy intersections|fuzzy intersection]]s, and [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy unions|fuzzy union]]s.

==Standard fuzzy set operations==
Let A and B be fuzzy sets that A,B ⊆ U, u is any element (e.g. value) in the U universe: u ∈ U.

;Standard complement
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\lnot{A}}(u) = 1 - \mu_A(u)&lt;/math&gt;
The complement is sometimes denoted by '''∁'''A or A&lt;sup&gt;'''∁'''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of '''¬'''A.

;Standard intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cap B}(u) = \min\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Standard union
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cup B}(u) = \max\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the triple (i,u,n) is called '''[[t-norm#Non-standard negators|De Morgan Triplet]]''' [[iff]]
* i is a [[t-norm#Definition|t-norm]],
* u is a [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]] (aka s-norm),
* n is a [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]],
so that for all ''x'',''y'' ∈ [0, 1] the following holds true: 
:''u''(''x'',''y'') = ''n''(''i''(''n''(''x''), ''n''(''y'')) 
(generalized De Morgan relation).&lt;ref&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the axioms provided below in detail.

==Fuzzy complements==
''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is defined as the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''A''. Let ''∁A'' denote a fuzzy complement of ''A'' of type ''c''. Then ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''∁A'', and the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''A''. (''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is therefore the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''∁A''.) Let a complement '''''∁'''A'' be defined by a function

:''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1]

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''c''(''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''))

===Axioms for fuzzy complements===
;Axiom c1. ''Boundary condition''
:''c''(0) = 1 and ''c''(1) = 0

;Axiom c2. ''Monotonicity''
:For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ [0, 1], if ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then ''c''(''a'') &gt; ''c''(''b'')

;Axiom c3. ''Continuity''
:''c'' is continuous function.

;Axiom c4. ''Involutions'' 
:''c'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], which means that ''c''(''c''(''a'')) = ''a'' for each ''a'' ∈ [0,1]
''c'' is a ''strong [[T-norm#Non-standard negators|negator]]'' (aka ''fuzzy complement'').

A function c satisfying axioms c1 and c2 has at least one fixpoint a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with c(a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
and if axiom c3 is fulfilled as well there is exactly one such fixpoint. For the standard negator c(x) = 1-x the unique fixpoint is a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 .&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010"&gt;Günther Rudolph: [https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/rudolph/teaching/lectures/CI/WS2009-10/lec06.pps Computational Intelligence (PPS)], TU Dortmund, Algorithm Engineering LS11, Winter Term 2009/10. Note that this power point sheet may have some problems with special character rendering&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuzzy intersections==
{{main|T-norm}}
The intersection of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval, a function of the form      
  
:''i'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∩ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''i''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy intersection===
;Axiom i1. ''Boundary condition''
:''i''(''a'', 1) = ''a''

;Axiom i2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''i''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''i''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom i3. ''Commutativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''b'') = ''i''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom i4. ''Associativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''i''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''i''(''i''(''a'', ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom i5. ''Continuity''
:''i'' is a continuous function

;Axiom i6. ''Subidempotency''
:''i''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''a''

;Axiom i7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Axioms i1 up to i4 define a '''t-norm''' (aka '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-norm min is the only idempotent t-norm (that is, ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a'' for all ''a'' ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

FUZZY UNION
The union of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval function of the form

:''u'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∪ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''u''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy union===
;Axiom u1.  ''Boundary condition''
:''u''(''a'', 0) =''u''(0 ,''a'') = ''a''

;Axiom u2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''u''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''u''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom u3. ''Commutativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''b'') = ''u''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom u4. ''Associativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''u''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''u''(''u''(''a, ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom u5. ''Continuity''
:''u'' is a continuous function

;Axiom u6. ''Superidempotency''
:''u''(''a'', ''a'') ≥ ''a''

;Axiom u7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  implies ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

Axioms u1 up to u4 define a '''t-conorm''' (aka '''s-norm''' or '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-conorm max is the only idempotent t-conorm (i. e. u (a1, a1) = a for all a ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

==Aggregation operations==
Aggregation operations on fuzzy sets are operations by which several fuzzy sets are combined in a desirable way to produce a single fuzzy set.

Aggregation operation on ''n'' fuzzy set (2 ≤ ''n'') is defined by a function

:''h'':[0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,1]

===Axioms for aggregation operations fuzzy sets===
;Axiom h1. ''Boundary condition''
:''h''(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0  and  ''h''(1, 1, ..., 1) = one

;Axiom h2. ''Monotonicity''
:For any pair &lt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; and &lt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; of ''n''-tuples such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ [0,1] for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''h''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, ''h'' is monotonic increasing in all its arguments.

;Axiom h3. ''Continuity''
:''h'' is a continuous function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17871">'''Genetic purging''' is the reduction of the frequency of a deleterious [[allele]], caused by an increased efficiency of natural selection prompted by [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Dorado |first1=A. |title=On the consequences of ignoring purging on genetic recommendations of MVP rules |journal=Heredity |date=15 April 2015 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2015.28 |volume=115 |pages=185–187|pmc=4814235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purging occurs because many deleterious alleles only express all their harmful effect when [[homozygous]], present in two copies. During inbreeding, as related individuals mate, they produce offspring that are more likely to be homozygous. Deleterious alleles appear more often, making individuals less fit genetically, i.e. they pass fewer copies of their genes to future generations. Put another way, [[natural selection]] purges the deleterious alleles.

Purging reduces both the overall number of recessive deleterious alleles and the decline of mean fitness caused by inbreeding (the [[inbreeding depression]] for fitness).

The term "purge" is sometimes used for selection against deleterious alleles in a general way. It would avoid ambiguity to use "[[purifying selection]]" in that general context, and to reserve purging to its more strict meaning defined above.

== The mechanism ==

Deleterious alleles segregating in populations of [[diploid]] organisms have a remarkable trend to be, at least, partially recessive. This means that, when they occur in homozygosis (double copies), they reduce [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by more than twice than when they occur in heterozygosis (single copy). In other words, part of their potential deleterious effect is hidden in heterozygosis but expressed in homozygosis, so that selection is more efficient against them when they occur in homozygosis. Since inbreeding increases the probability of being homozygous, it increases the fraction of the potential deleterious effect that is expressed and, therefore, exposed to selection. This causes some increase in the selective pressure against (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, which is known as purging. Of course, it also causes some reduction in fitness, which is known as [[inbreeding depression]].

Purging can reduce the average frequency of deleterious alleles across the genome below the value expected in a non-inbred population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glémin|first=S|year=2003|title=How are deleterious mutations purged? Drift versus nonrandom mating|journal=Evolution|volume=57|pages=2678–2687|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01512.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this reduction usually does not compensate for all the negative effects of inbreeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedrick|first1=P. W.|first2=S. T.|last2=Kalinowski|year=2000|title=Inbreeding depression in conservation biology|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=31|pages=139–162|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.139}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has several beneficial consequences for fitness. A consequence is the reduction of the so-called inbreeding load. This means that, after purging, further inbreeding is expected to be less harmful. But the most immediate consequence is the reduction of the actual inbreeding depression of fitness: due to purging, mean fitness declines less than would be expected just from inbreeding and, after some initial decline, it can even rebound up to almost its value before inbreeding.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last=García-Dorado|first=A|year=2012|title=Understanding and predicting the fitness decline of shrunk populations: inbreeding, purging, mutation and standard selection|journal=Genetics|volume=190|pages=1461–1476|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.135541|pmid=22298709|pmc=3316656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The joint effect of inbreeding and purging on fitness ==

Accounting for purging when predicting inbreeding depression is important in evolutionary genetics, because the fitness decline caused by inbreeding can be determinant in the evolution of [[diploidy]], sexual reproduction and other main biological features. It is also important in animal breeding and, of course, in [[conservation genetics]], because inbreeding depression may be a relevant factor determining the extinction risk of endangered populations, and because conservation programs can allow some breeding handling in order to control inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankham|first=R|year=2005|title=Genetics and extinction|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=126|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, Due to purging, inbreeding depression is not proportional to the standard measure of inbreeding (Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), since this measure only applies to [[Neutral evolution|neutral]] alleles. Instead, fitness decline is proportional to "purged inbreeding" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which gives the probability of being homozygous for deleterious alleles due to inbreeding, taking into account how they are being purged.

Purging reduces inbreeding depression in two ways: first, it slows its progress; second, it reduces the overall inbreeding depression expected in the long term. The slower the progress of inbreeding, the more efficient is purging.

=== A more detailed explanation ===

In the absence of natural selection, mean fitness would be expected to decline exponentially as inbreeding increases, where inbreeding is measured using Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crow|first1=J.F.|first2=M.|last2=Kimura|year=1970|title=An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the reason why decline is exponential on {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of linear is just that fitness is usually considered a multiplicative trait). The rate at which fitness declines as {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases (the inbreeding depression rate ''δ'') depends on the frequencies and deleterious effects of the alleles present in the population before inbreeding.

The above coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is the standard measure of inbreeding, and gives the probability that, at any given neutral locus, an individual has inherited two copies of a same gene of a common ancestor (i.e. the probability of being homozygous "by descent"). In simple conditions, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can be easily computed in terms of population size or of genealogical information. {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is often denoted using lowercase ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;f&lt;/VAR&gt;}}), but should not be confused with the coancestry coefficient.

However, the above prediction for the fitness decline rarely applies, since it was derived assuming no selection, and fitness is precisely the target trait of [[natural selection]]. Thus, Wright's inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} for neutral loci does not apply to deleterious alleles, unless inbreeding increases so fast that the change in gene frequency is governed just by random sampling (i.e., by [[genetic drift]]).

Therefore, the decline of fitness should be predicted using, instead of the standard inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, a "purged inbreeding coefficient" ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) that gives the probability of being homozygous by descent for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, taking into account how their frequency is reduced by purging.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Due to purging, fitness declines at the same rate {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/var&gt;}} than in the absence of selection, but as a function of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} instead of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.
 
This purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can also be computed, to a good approximation, using simple expressions in terms of the population size or of the genealogy of individuals (see BOX 1). However this requires some information on the magnitude of the deleterious effects that are hidden in the heterozygous condition but become expressed in homozygosis. The larger this magnitude, denoted purging coefficient ''d'', the more efficient is purging.

An interesting property of purging is that, during inbreeding, while {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}} increases approaching a final value {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} can approach a much smaller final value. Hence, it is not just that purging slows the fitness decline, but also that it reduces the overall fitness loss produced by inbreeding in the long term. This is illustrated in BOX 2 for the extreme case of inbreeding depression caused by recessive lethals, which are alleles that cause death before reproduction but only when they occur in homozygosis. Purging is less effective against mildly deleterious alleles than against lethal ones but, in general, the slower is the increase of inbreeding {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;F&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, the smaller becomes the final value of the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;g&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and, therefore, the final reduction in fitness. This implies that, if inbreeding progresses slowly enough, no relevant inbreeding depression is expected in the long term. This results in the fitness of a small population, that has been a small population for a long time, can be the same as a large population with more genetic diversity. In conservation genetics, it would be very useful to ascertain the maximum rate of increase of inbreeding that allows for such efficient purging.

== Examples ==

=== Predictive equations when inbreeding is due to small population size ===
Consider a large non-inbred population with mean fitness {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}. Then, the size of the population reduces to a new smaller value {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;N&lt;/VAR&gt;}} (in fact, the [[effective population size]] should be used here), leading to a progressive increase of inbreeding.

Then inbreeding depression occurs at a rate {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, due to (partially) recessive deleterious alleles that were present at low frequencies at different loci. This means that, in the absence of selection, the expected value for mean fitness after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding, would be:

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta F_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is the population mean for Wright's inbreeding coefficient after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, since selection operates upon fitness, mean fitness should be predicted taking into acco naveenraj unt both inbreeding and purging, as

&lt;math&gt;W_t = W e^{-\delta g_t}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation, &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; is the average "purged inbreeding coefficient" after {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}} generations of inbreeding.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt; It depends upon the "purging coefficient" {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;d&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, which represents the deleterious effects that are hidden in heterozygosis but exposed in homozygosis.

The average "purged inbreeding coefficient" can be approximated using the recurrent expression

&lt;math&gt;g_t = \left [ \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2N} \right ) g_{t-1} + \frac{1}{2N} \right ] \left [ 1 - 2dF_{t-1} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

There are also predictive equations to be used with genealogical information.

=== The example of inbreeding depression due to recessive lethals ===
[[File:Fitness decline from lethals vs generations of inbreeding.tif|thumb|200px|Average population fitness ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) against number of generations ({{math|&lt;VAR&gt;t&lt;/VAR&gt;}}) of maintenance with population size N=10 when, in the original population, individuals carried on the average one rare recessive lethal. Evolution of {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;W&lt;/VAR&gt;}} expected only from inbreeding (red line) or from inbreeding and purging (blue line).]]
As an example of genetic purging, consider a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles. Although about 63% of the individuals carry at least one of these lethal alleles, almost none carry two copies of the same lethal. Therefore, since lethals are considered completely recessive (i.e., they are harmless in heterozygosis), they cause almost no deaths. Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say ''N''=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them. The figure to the right gives the expected decline of fitness against the number of generations, taking into account just the increase in inbreeding {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}} (red line), or both inbreeding and purging (blue line, computed using the purged inbreeding coefficient {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}). This example shows that purging can be very efficient preventing inbreeding depression. However, for non-lethal deleterious alleles, the efficiency of purging would be smaller, and it can require larger populations to overcome genetic drift.

=== Genome renewal ===
The yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] and [[Saccharomyces paradoxus]] have a life cycle that alternates between long periods of [[asexual reproduction]] as a diploid, ending in [[meiosis]] that is usually immediately followed [[selfing]], with only rare [[outcrossing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsai|first1=I. J.|last2=Bensasson|first2=D.|last3=Burt|first3=A.|last4=Koufopanou|first4=V.|title=Population genomics of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus: Quantifying the life cycle|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=14 March 2008|volume=105|issue=12|pages=4957–4962|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707314105|pmid=18344325|pmc=2290798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during the diploid expansion phase, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed "genome renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mortimer|first1=Robert K.|last2=Romano|first2=Patrizia|last3=Suzzi|first3=Giovanna|last4=Polsinelli|first4=Mario|title=Genome renewal: A new phenomenon revealed from a genetic study of 43 strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae derived from natural fermentation of grape musts|journal=Yeast|date=December 1994|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1543–1552|doi=10.1002/yea.320101203|pmid=7725789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masel|first1=Joanna |author1link=Joanna Masel|last2=Lyttle|first2=David N.|title=The consequences of rare sexual reproduction by means of selfing in an otherwise clonally reproducing species|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2011|volume=80|issue=4|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2011.08.004|pmid=21888925|pmc=3218209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and problems ==
When a previously stable population undergoes inbreeding, if nothing else changes, natural selection should consist mainly of purging. The joint consequences of inbreeding and purging on fitness vary depending on many factors: the previous history of the population, the rate of increase of inbreeding, the harshness of the environment or of the competitive conditions, etc. The effects of purging were first noted by Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C. R.|authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1876|title=The effects of cross and selffertilisation in the vegetable kingdom|location=London|publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; in plants, and have been detected in laboratory experiments and in vertebrate populations undergoing inbreeding in zoos or in the wild, as well as in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crnokrak|first1=P.|last2=Barrett|first2=S. C. H.|year=2002|title=Purging the genetic load: a review of the experimental evidence|journal=Evolution|volume=56|pages=2347–2358|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00160.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of purging is often obscured by many factors, but there is consistent evidence that, in agreement with the predictions explained above, slow inbreeding results in more efficient purging, so that a given inbreeding F leads to less threat to population viability if it has been produced more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leberg|first1=P. L.|last2=Firmin|first2=B. D.|year=2008|title=Role of inbreeding depression and purging in captive breeding and restoration programmes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=334–343|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03433.x|pmid=18173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in practical situations, the genetic change in fitness also depends on many other factors, besides inbreeding and purging. For example, adaptation to changing environmental conditions often causes relevant genetic changes during inbreeding. Furthermore, if inbreeding is due to a reduction in population size, selection against new deleterious [[mutation]]s can become less efficient, and this can induce additional fitness decline in the medium-long term.

In addition, part of the inbreeding depression could not be due to deleterious alleles, but to an intrinsic advantage of being heterozygous compared to being homozygous for any available allele, which is known as overdominance. Inbreeding depression caused by overdominance cannot be purged, but seems to be a minor cause of overall inbreeding depression, although its actual importance is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crow|first=JF|year=2008|title=Mid-century controversies in population genetics|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=42|pages=1–16|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.42.110807.091612|pmid=18652542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, predicting the actual evolution of fitness during inbreeding is highly elusive. However, the component of fitness decline expected from inbreeding and purging on deleterious alleles could be predicted using {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}}.

The study of '''geometric morphometrics in anthropology''' has made a major impact on the field of [[morphometrics]] by aiding in some of the technological and methodological advancements. Geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables. The landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size, position, and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats, especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes, which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelditch2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology, which has more recently been named virtual anthropology. Virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology, the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape (such as geometric morphometrics) and form...&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=Gerhard|title=Virtual Anthropology|journal=Yearbook of Physical Anthropology|date=2015|issue=156|pages=22–42|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22658|pmid=25418603|volume=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with [[Francis Galton]] (1822-1911). Galton was a polymath and the president of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Slice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slice|first1=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2007|issue=1|pages=261–81|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120613|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base-line registration approach for shape comparisons.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitteroecker|first1=Philipp|last2=Gunz|first2=Philipp|title=Advances in Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Evolutionary Biology|date=2009|issue=2|pages=235–247|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; This was later adapted by Fred Bookstein and termed “two-point coordinates” or “Bookstein-shape coordinates”.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

In the 1940s, [[D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (biologist and mathematician, 1860-1948)  looked at ways to quantify that could be attached to biological shape based on developmental and evolutionary theories. This led to the first branch of multivariate morphometrics, which emphasized matrix manipulations involving variables.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohlf|first1=F. James|last2=Bookstein|first2=Fred L.|title=Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop|date=1990|publisher=Special Publication 2, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|location=Ann Arbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Bookstein (currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of Vienna) began using Cartesian transformations and [[David George Kendall]] (statistician, 1918-2007) showed that figures that hold the same shape can be treated as separate points in a geometric space.&lt;ref name=RohlfBookstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bookstein|first1=Fred L.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|title=Anthropology Takes Control of Morphometrics|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|date=2004|volume=2|issue=28|pages=121–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1996, Leslie Marcus (paleontologist, 1930-2002) convinced colleagues to use morphometrics on the famous [[Ötzi|Ötzi skeleton]], which helped expose the importance of the applications of these methods.&lt;ref name=Bookstein2004 /&gt;

==Traditional morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|left|BirdMorpho]] 
Traditional morphometrics is the study of morphological variations between or within groups using multivariate statistical tools. Shape is defined by collecting and analyzing length measurements, counts, ratios, and angles.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Mark|last2=Sheets|first2=David H.|title=A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=2010|volume=16|issue=Quantitative Methods in Paleobiology|pages=163–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Dean C.|last2=Rohlf|first2=F. James|last3=Slice|first3=Dennis E.|title=Geometric Morphometrics: Ten Years of Progress Following the 'Revolution'|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2004|volume=71|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/11250000409356545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The statistical tools are able to quantify the covariation within and between samples. Some of the typical statistical tools used for traditional morphometrics are: [[principal components]], [[factor analysis]], [[canonical analysis|canonical variate]], and [[discriminant function analysis]]. It is also possible to study [[allometry]], which is the observed change in shape when there is change in size. However, there are problems pertaining to size correction since linear distance is highly correlated with size. There have been multiple methods put forth to correct for this correlation, but these methods disagree and can end up with different results using the same dataset. Another problem is linear distances are not always defined by the same landmarks making it difficult to use for comparative purposes.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; For shape analysis itself, which is the goal of morphometrics, the biggest downside to traditional morphometrics is that it does not capture the complete variation of shape in space, which is what the measurements are supposed to be based on.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; For example, if one tried to compare the length and width for an oval and tear drop shape with the same dimensions they would be deemed as the same using traditional morphometrics.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt; Geometric morphometrics tries to correct these problems by capturing more variability in shape.

==Steps in a geometric morphometric study==
There is a basic structure to successfully performing and completing every geometric morphometric study:
# '''Design Study''': what is your objective/hypothesis? what morphology must you capture to explore this? 
# '''[[#Data Collection Methods|Collect Data]]''': choose your landmark set and method of collection
# '''[[#Superimposition|Standardize Data]]''': make your landmarks comparable across all specimens (superimposition) 
# '''[[#Statistical Analysis|Analyze Data]]''': choose a statistical approach depending on your original question and how you designed the study 
# '''[[#Some Applications in Physical Anthropology|Interpret Results]]''': take the outcome of your statistical analysis and reflect it back to the context of your original specimens

==Data collection methods==

===Landmarks===
The first step is to define your landmark set. Landmarks have to be anatomically recognizable and the same for all specimens in the study. Landmarks should be selected to properly capture the shape trying to be observed and capable of being replicated. The sample size should be roughly three times the amount of landmarks chosen and they must be recorded in the same order for every specimen.&lt;ref name=WebsterSheets2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===Semilandmarks===
[[File:3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl.png|thumb|upright=0.5|3D Cleaned Scanned Twirl]]
Semilandmarks, also called sliding landmarks, are used when the location of a landmark along a curvature might not be identifiable or repeatable.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Semilandmarks were created in order to take landmark based geometric morphometrics to the next step by capturing the shape of difficult areas such as smooth curves and surfaces.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; In order to obtain a semilandmark, the curvature still has to start and end on definable landmarks, capture observed morphology, remain homologous across specimens in the same steps seen above for regular landmarks, be equal in number, and equally distant apart.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; When this approach was first proposed, Bookstein suggested gaining semilandmarks by densely sampling landmarks along the surface in a mesh and slowly thinning out the landmarks until the desired curvature was obtained.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Newer landmark programs aid in the process but there are still some steps that must be taken in order for the semilandmarks to be the same across the whole sample. Semilandmarks are not placed on the actual curve or surface but on tangent vectors to the curve or tangent planes to the surface. The sliding of semilandmarks in new programs is performed by either selecting a specimen to be the model specimen for the rest of the specimens or using a computational sample mean from tangent vectors. Semilandmarks are automatically placed in most programs when the observer chooses a starting and ending point on definable landmarks and sliding the semilandmarks between them until the shape is captured. The semilandmarks are then mapped onto the rest of the specimens in the sample.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Since shape will differ between specimens, the observer has to manually go through and make sure the landmarks and semilandmarks are on the surface for the rest of the specimens. If not they must be moved to touch the surface, but this process still maintains the correct location. There is still room for improvement to these methods but this is the most consistent option at the moment. Once mapped on, these semilandmarks can be treated just like landmarks for statistical analysis.

===Deformation grid===
This is a different approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; Bookstein proposed the use of a [[thin-plate spline]] (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt; Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Superimposition==

===[[Generalized Procrustes analysis]] (GPA)===
Landmark and semilandmark coordinates can be recorded on each specimen, but size, orientation, and position can vary for each of those specimens adding in variables that distract from the analysis of shape. This can be fixed by using superimposition, with generalized procrusted analysis (GPA) being the most common application. GPA removes the variation of size, orientation, and position by superimposing the landmarks in a common coordinate system.&lt;ref name=Adams2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The landmarks for all specimens are optimally translated, rotated, and scaled based on a least-squared estimation. The first step is translation and rotation to minimize the squared and summed differences (squared Procrustes distance) between landmarks on each specimen. Then the landmarks are individually scaled to the same unit Centroid size. Centroid size is the square root of the sum of squared distances of the landmarks in configuration to their mean location. The translation, rotation, and scaling bring the landmark configurations for all specimens into a common coordinate system so that the only differing variables are based on shape alone. The new superimposed landmarks can now be analyzed in multivariate statistical analyses.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

==Statistical analysis==

===[[Principal components analysis]] (PCA)===
In general, principal components analysis is used to construct overarching variables that take the place of multiple correlated variables in order to reveal the underlying structure of the dataset. This is helpful in geometric morphometrics where a large set of landmarks can create correlated relationships that might be difficult to differentiate without reducing them in order to look at the overall variability in the data.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Reducing the number of variables is also necessary because the number of variables being observed and analyzed should not exceed sample size.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; Principal component scores are computed through an eigendecomposition of a sample’s covariance matrix and rotates the data to preserve procrustes distances. In other words, a principal components analysis preserves the shape variables that were scaled, rotated, and translated during the generalize procrustes analysis. The resulting principal component scores project the shape variables onto low-dimensional space based on eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt; The scores can be plotted various ways to look at the shape variables, such as scatterplots. It is important to explore what shape variables are being observed to make sure the principal components being analyzed are pertinent to the questions being asked. Although the components might show shape variables not relevant to the question at hand, it is perfectly acceptable to leave those components out any further analysis for a specific project.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt;

===[[Partial least squares regression|Partial least squares]] (PLS)===
Partial least squares is similar the principal components analysis in the fact that it reduces the number of variables being observed so patterns are more easily observed in the data, but it uses a linear regression model. PLS is an approach that looks at two or more sets of variables measured on the same specimens and extracts the linear combinations that best represent the pattern of covariance across the sets.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The linear combinations will optimally describe the covariances and provide a low-dimensional output to compare the different sets. With the highest shape variation covariance, mean shape, and the other shape covariances that exists among the sets, this approach is ideal for looking at the significance of group differences. PLS has been used a lot in studies that look at things such as sexual dimorphism, or other general morphological differences found at the population, subspecies, and species level.&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; It has also been used to look at functional, environmental, or behavioral differences that could influence the found shape covariance between sets&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

===[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate regression]]===
Multiple or multivariate regression is an approach to look at the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a dependent or influential variable. It is best used in geometric morphometrics when analyzing shape variables based on an external influence. For example, it can be used in studies with attached functional or environmental variables like age or the development over time in certain environments.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slice /&gt; The multivariate regression of shape based on the logarithm of centroid size (square root of the sum of squared distances of landmarks) is ideal for [[allometric]] studies. Allometry is the analysis of shape based on the biological parameters of growth and size. This approach is not affected by the number of dependent shape variables or their covariance, so the results of regression coefficients can be seen as a deformation in shape.&lt;ref name=Mitteroecker /&gt;

==Some applications in anthropology==

===Human evolution===

====The human brain====
The human brain is unique from other species based on the size of the [[visual cortex]], [[temporal lobe]], and [[parietal cortex]], and increased [[gyrification]] (folds of the brain). There have been many questions as to why these changes occurred and how they contributed to cognition and behavior, which are important questions in human evolution. Geometric morphometrics has been used to explore some of these questions using virtual [[endocasts]] (casts of the inside of the cranium) to gather information since brain tissue does not preserve in the fossil record. Geometric morphometrics can reveal small shape differences between brains such as differences between modern humans and [[Neanderthals]] whose brains were similar in size.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rein|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Harvati|first2=Katerina|title=Geometric Morphometrics and Virtual Anthropology: Advances in human evolutionary studies|journal=Journal of Biological and Clinical Anthropology|date=2014|volume=71|pages=41–55|doi=10.1127/0003-5548/2014/0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neubauer and colleagues looked at the endocasts of [[chimpanzees]] and modern humans to observe brain growth using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found that there is an early “[[globularization]] phase” in human brain development that shows expansion of the parietal and cerebellar areas, which does not occur in chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neubauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubauer|first1=S.|last2=Gunz|first2=P.|last3=Hublin|first3=J.|title=Endocranial shape changes during growth in chimpanzees and humans: A morphometric analysis of unique and shared aspects|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=555–566|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.011|pmid=20727571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunz and colleagues extended the study further and found that the “globularization phase” does not occur in Neanderthals and instead Neanderthal brain growth is more similar to chimpanzees. This difference could point to some important changes in the human brain that led to different organization and cognitive functions&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Golovanova|first3=L.|last4=Doronichev|first4=V.|last5=Maureille|first5=B.|last6=Hublin|first6=J.|title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development: Insights from a new cranial reconstruction of the Neanderthal newborn from Mezmaiskaya|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|issue=2|pages=300–313|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.11.013|pmid=22221766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunz|first1=P.|last2=Neubauer|first2=S.|last3=Maureille|first3=B.|last4=Hublin|first4=J.|title=Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=21|pages=921–922|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.018|pmid=21056830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pleistocene cranial morphology====
There have been many debates on the relationships between [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] hominin crania from [[Eurasia]] and Africa because they display a mosaic of both primitive and derived traits. Studies on cranial morphology for these specimens have created arguments that Eurasian fossils from the Middle Pleistocene are a transition between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and later hominins like Neanderthals and modern humans. However, there are two sides to the argument with one side saying that the European and African fossils are from a single taxon while others say that the Neanderthal lineage should be included. Harvati and colleagues decided to attempt to quantify the craniofacial features of Neanderthals and European Middle Pleistocene fossils using 3D landmarks to try to add to the debate. They found that some features were more Neanderthal like while others were primitive and likely from the Middle Pleistocene African hominins, so the argument could still go either way.&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvati2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvati|first1=K.|last2=Hublin|first2=J.|last3=Gunz|first3=P.|title=Evolution of middle-late Pleistocene human cranio-facial form: a 3D approach|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2010|volume=59|issue=5|pages=445–464|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.005|pmid=20708775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freidline and colleagues further added to the debate by looking at both adult and subadult crania of modern and Pleistocene hominins using 3D landmarks and semilandmarks. They found similarities in facial morphology between Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa and a divide in facial morphology during the Pleistocene based on time period. The study also found that some characteristics separating Neanderthals from Middle Pleistocene hominins, like the size of the nasal aperture and degree of midfacial prognathism, might be due to allometric differences&lt;ref name=ReinHarvati /&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidline&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freidline|first1=SE|last2=Gunz|first2=G.|last3=Harvati|first3=K.|last4=Hublin|first4=J|title=Middle Pleistocene human facial morphology in an evolutionary and developmental context|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=63|issue=5|pages=723–740|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.08.002|pmid=22981042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern human variation===

====Ancestry and sex estimation of crania====
Crania can be used to classify ancestry and sex to aid in [[forensic]] contexts such as crime scenes and mass fatalities. In 2010, Ross and colleagues were provided federal funds by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] to compile data for population specific classification criteria using geometric morphometrics. Their aim was to create an extensive population database from 3D landmarks on human crania, to develop and validate population specific procedures for classification of unknown individuals, and develop software to use in forensic identification. They placed 3D landmarks on 75 craniofacial landmarks from European, African, and Hispanic populations of about 1000 individuals with a Microscribe digitizer. The software they developed, called [http://www.3d-id.org/ 3D-ID], can classify unknown individuals into probable sex and ancestry, and allows for fragmentary and damaged specimens to be used.&lt;ref name=RossSlice&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ann H.|last2=Slice|first2=Dennis E.|last3=Williams|first3=Shanna E.|title=Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls|date=2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the full manuscript can be found here: [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231195.pdf Geometric Morphometric Tools for the Classification of Human Skulls]

====Sex estimation of os coxae====
Geometric morphometrics can also be used to capture the slight shape variations found in postcranial bones of the human body such as ''[[os coxae]]''. Bierry and colleagues used 3D CT reconstructions of modern adult pelvic bones for 104 individuals to look at the shape of the [[obturator foramen]]. After a normalization technique to take out the factor of size, they outlined the obturator foramen with landmarks and semilandmarks to capture its shape. They chose the obturator foramen because it tends to be oval in males and triangular in females. The results show a classification accuracy of 88.5% for males and 80.8% for females using a [[Fourier Analysis|Discriminant Fourier Analysis]].&lt;ref name=Bierryetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierry|first1=Guillaume|last2=Le Minor|first2=Jean-Marie|last3=Schmittbuhl|first3=Mathieu|title=Oval in Males and Triangular in Females?

They placed landmarks and semilandmarks on 2D photographic images of 121 left pelvic bones from a collection of undocumented skeletons at the Museu Anthropológico de Coimbra in Portugal. Since the pelvic bones were of unknown origin, they used a [[K-means clustering|K-means Cluster Analysis]] to determine a sex category before performing a [[Discriminant function analysis|Discriminant Function analysis]]. The results had a classification accuracy for the [[greater sciatic notch]] of 90.9% and the ischiopubic ramus at 93.4 to 90.1%&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Paula N.|last2=Bernal|first2=Valeria|last3=Perez|first3=Ivan S.|title=Geometric Morphometric Approach to Sex Estimation of Human Pelvis|journal=Forensic Science International|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.012|volume=189|issue=1–3|pages=68–74|pmid=19442464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global resources dividend''' (GRD) is a method of tackling [[global poverty]] advanced by the philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]].&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt; He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas W.|title=Eradicating Systemic Poverty: Brief for a global resources dividend|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1080/14649880120050246|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/global-resources-dividend/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issn=1464-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on  any resources that they use or sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 October 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–327|url=http://www.icrea.cat/Web/GetFile.asmx/Download?idFile=bIujBBG01Ac%3D|accessdate=6 April 2015|doi=10.1163/174552411X591339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Widdows, N. Smith (2011) ''Global Social Justice'', Routlege:  New York, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a sort of "tax on consumption"&lt;ref name = PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate [[economic inequality]]. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.

Implementing some version of the GRD [[logical consequence|entails]] not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it "Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the [[original position]] the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts."&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Rights of the disadvantaged==
{{quotebox|quoted=1|source=Thomas Pogge's hypothetical speech to the global poor; he says we should give that speech if we decide that international cooperation is unrealistic, and not worth attempting.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;|align=right|width=40%|quote= We care deeply about equality, and we would very much like it to be the case that you are not so much worse off than we are. But, unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect that we would actually comply with more egalitarian global institutions. Since no one would benefit from a futile attempt to maintain impracticable institutions, we should all just rest content with the global inequalities of the status quo.}}
Pogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Pogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Rawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject [[totalitarianism]], for instance.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.

Under the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below).&lt;ref&gt;Haubrich. Dirk (2004) Global Distributive Justice and the Taxation of Natural Resources – Who Should Pick Up the Tab?,''Contemporary Political Theory'', 3: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in [[Sierra Leone]]. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Implementing a GRD==
Each nation or "peoples" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a "tax on consumption".&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

The funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a [[world government]] is not ''necessary''. The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide [[basic rights]] to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding [[NGO]]s may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report 2009-1.png|thumb|right|350px|There are different inequalities between, but also (pictured above) within countries. As the system around the GRD becomes more sophisticated, it could accommodate such issues.]]
The lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; (e.g. the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=What We Owe to the Global Poor: Political Philosophy Meets Development Economics|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Harvard University|pages=52|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=1599|accessdate=6 April 2015|ref=risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.

Primary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.

== Criticism ==
Richard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.&lt;ref name=Reichel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichel|first1=Richard|title=Internationaler Handel, Tauschgerechtigkeit und die globale Rohstoffdividende|journal=Analyse und Kritik|date=1997|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses [[Joseph Heath]]'s argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=Thomas Pogge’s Global Resources Dividend: A Critique and an Alternative|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 November 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1740468105058157|url=https://www.academia.edu/7038440/Thomas_Pogges_Global_Resources_Dividend_a_critique_and_an_alternative|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grazing fire''' is a term used in [[military science]] and defined by NATO and the US Department Of Defense as “Fire approximately parallel to the ground where the center of the cone of fire does not rise above one meter from the ground.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html "DOD Dictionary of Military Terms"]&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing fire is often performed by [[machine guns]]. It is tactically advantageous when attempting to cut off an infantry ground assault or counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/23-65/index.html Army Field Manual No. 23-65] "BROWNING MACHINE GUN CALIBER .50 HB, M2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Grazing fire is when the cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave the barrel of the weapon at the axis of bore set from the angle of sight desired to strike the target area. The trajectory of the round should be constant as well as maximum ordinate. Maximum ordinate is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a semi-flat trajectory. With [[7.62×51mm NATO]] ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the [[M240]] machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered [[plunging fire]] due to the arc (axis of bore + angle of sight) needed to impact the target area.

Grazing fire is so named because it cuts the vegetation low as though a herd of cattle had been grazing there. The optimal height of fire should be at knee height. In addition to keeping the enemy pinned down, anybody wounded or going to cover will fall into the line of fire, not out of it.

In comparison, red dwarf stars have too much solar activity and quickly tidally lock the planets in their habitable zones, making them less suitable for life. The odds of intelligent life arising may be better on planets around K-type main-sequence stars than around Sun-like stars, given the extra time available for it to evolve.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Few planets thus far have been found around K-type main-sequence stars, but those that have are potential candidates for extraterrestrial life.&lt;ref name=ShigaDavid /&gt;

==Habitable zone==
A K-type star's [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] approximately ranges between 0.1–0.4 to 0.3–1.3 AU from the star. Here, exoplanets will receive only a relatively small amount of ultraviolet radiation, especially so towards the outer edge. This is favorable to support life, as it means that there is enough radiated energy to allow liquid water to exist on the surface, but not so much radiation as to destroy life.&lt;ref name=MerchantDavid /&gt;

The habitable zone is also very stable, lasting for most of the K-type main-sequence star's [[main sequence]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;"Kepler's Hunt for Earths Shows Progress at Space Conference" Hadhazy, Adam March 9, 2010 12:00 AM&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrodynamic separators''' (HDS) are [[stormwater]] management devices that use [[cyclonic separation]] to control [[water pollution]].  They are designed as flow-through structures with a settling or separation unit to remove [[sediment]] and other pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Hydrodynamic Separators |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1000ZRK.txt |date=September 1999 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 832-F-99-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDS are considered structural [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs), and are used to treat and pre-treat stormwater [[surface runoff|runoff]].

== Design and applications ==
HDS systems use the physics of flowing water to remove a variety of pollutants and are characterized by an internal structure that either creates a swirling [[vortex]] or plunges the water into the main sump.&lt;ref name="Mohseni"&gt;Mohseni, Omid; Saddoris, David A.; McIntire, Kurtis D.; Gulliver, John S. (2010). [http://www.cts.umn.edu/Publications/ResearchReports/reportdetail.html?id=1890 "Hydrodynamic Separator Sediment Retention Testing."] Technical Report No. MN/RC 2010-10. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Along with supplemental features to reduce velocity, an HDS system is designed to separate floatables (trash, debris and oil) and settleable particles, like sediment, from stormwater. HDS systems are not effective for the removal of very fine [[suspended solids|solids]] or dissolved pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; The systems are also subject to scour and sediment washout during large storm events, e.g. a 10-year storm.&lt;ref name="Mohseni" /&gt;{{rp|42}}

== Evaluation ==
A number of factors are relevant in selecting a hydrodynamic separator product for a site.

=== Sizing and treatment performance ===
HDS systems should be sized based on treatment objectives including desired level of pollutant removal, drainage basin characteristics, climate of the region, and particle size to be targeted. Performance is also sensitive to water temperature, i.e. season.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Care must be taken to avoid routing excess flow through the device and compromising performance. Each vendor’s product has different pollutant removal rates that should be evaluated before selecting the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

The TAPE and TARP programs are evaluation programs sponsored by several state agencies in the U.S. These programs include lab and field testing and provide specific sizing criteria for hydrodynamic separation systems.&lt;ref&gt;State of Washington. Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/0210037.pdf Technology Assessment Protocol - Ecology (TAPE): Guidance for Evaluating Emerging Stormwater Treatment Technologies.] January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Trenton, NJ (2007). [http://www.state.nj.us/dep/dsr/bscit/TARPMain.htm "Technology Acceptance and Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) Program."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT). Bordentown, NJ. [http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm "A Comprehensive Approach to Performance Verification for Stormwater Treatment Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010183709/http://www.njcat.org/education/glossary.cfm |date=2008-10-10 }} Accessed 2011-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the EWRI-ASCE and the ASTM International are developing comprehensive verification guidelines and standard test methods for assessing the performance of these devices.

=== Maintenance and inspection requirements ===
HDS systems are not maintenance-intensive, when compared with land-based BMP’s.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; Each manufactured system is different, therefore maintenance and inspection requirements should be looked at closely when purchasing an HDS system. [[Vacuum truck]]s are typically used for maintenance, so unobstructed access to accumulated pollutants for removal is critical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Installation and operating costs ===
Costs for HDS systems depend on site-specific conditions such as land characteristics, amount of runoff to be treated, system depth and performance requirements. Be aware that not all HDS systems are alike in treatment performance, and basing a decision solely on the installation and operating cost of a system may compromise system performance and the environment. Long-term maintenance costs should also be considered with overall costs when purchasing or selecting a stormwater BMP as initial installation and operating costs may not reflect the long-term investment needed to maintain the system.&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt;

=== Land costs ===
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), “Using structural BMPs that can be placed underground and are design to withstand site specific soil, groundwater and traffic loading conditions provide valuable savings in land area compared to conventional volume-based stormwater treatment practices such as ponds, wetlands, and swales.”&lt;ref name="EPA Fact1" /&gt; HDS systems may be ideal for areas where land is not readily available and/or tight retrofits are needed as they are installed underground.

== Regulations ==
As stormwater regulations become increasingly stringent, many states and municipalities have developed criteria to govern the use and sizing of HDS systems, and publish lists that identify acceptable HDS systems.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see NJDEP list of approved [http://www.njstormwater.org/treatment.html "Stormwater Manufactured Treatment Devices."] 2011-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions evaluate the applicability of HDS on a site-specific basis.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Maryland Department of the Environment, [http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/Proprietary%202005.pdf "Maryland’s Stormwater Program &amp; Proprietary Practices."] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly common to use HDS as the first component of a treatment train, a combination of BMPs in series, to remove coarse solids and floatable pollutants that can rapidly clog other BMPs thus prolonging their maintenance cycle.

Contemporary rhetoric focuses on cultural contexts and general structures of rhetoric structures. [[Kenneth Burke]] is one of the most notable contemporary U.S. rhetoricians who made major contributions to the rhetoric of identification. One of his most foundational ideas is as follows, “rhetoric makes human unity possible, that language use is symbolic action, and that rhetoric is symbolic inducement.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction|last=Herrick|first=James A.|publisher=Allyn Bacon|year=2012|isbn=978-0205078585|location=New York|pages=10, 225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branching from this, Herrick states that identification in rhetoric is crucial to persuasion, and thus to cooperation, consensus, compromise, and action. Burke believed that the most serious human problem was to be alienated or separated, and rhetoric was to be that problem’s only solution. Much of his work was based on bringing people back together. “Identification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rhetoric’s goal, in regards to identification, is to bring people together of whom have been separated by estrangement or opposition.

==History==
Kenneth Burke plays an important part in learning and understanding the core values of rhetorical theory in identification. He introduces the notion by taking the Aristotelian approach into a "world of particulars." Burke states that [[Aristotle]] treated rhetoric as purely verbal. But there are also areas of overlap. The flexibility of identification that Burke has created expands into elements beyond language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Keith|date=2006|title=Burke, Frazer, and Ritual: Attitudes toward Attitudes|url=http://kbjournal.org/gibson|journal=KB Journal|volume=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote that “identification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, ‘I was a farm boy myself,’ through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic’s devout identification with the source of all being.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This symbolic interaction is possible because it recognizes the hidden sources of identification among human beings as symbol users. From this, Burke understands symbols as something that is around constantly, and that choosing to accept and learning to read them accurately is what needs to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutton|first=Kris|last2=Soetaert|first2=Ronald|date=2014|title=A Rhetoric of Turns: Signs and Symbols in Education|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9752.12081/full|journal=Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume=48|pages=604–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Burke’s theory of identification has been applied and expanded upon in [[Rhetoric|Krista Ratcliff&lt;nowiki/&gt;e]]’s Rhetorical Listening Framework. Ratcliffe proposes the “blurring of Burke’s and Fuss’s theories of identification, what becomes visible is multiple places for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness|last=Ratcliffe|first=Krista|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=|isbn=0-8093-2669-8|location=|pages=69, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When applying Burke and Fuss’s theories, Ratcliffe proposes non-identification in cross-cultural communication and feminist [[pedagogy]]. Her critique of Western logic is that it is difficult to simultaneously pay attention to both commonalities and differences, but that is where non-identification exists and thus provides a place for rhetorical listening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Burke’s theory is critiqued by Ratcliffe for only focusing on identification; she argues that rhetorical listeners need to be accountable and take into consideration different points of view, which can be done through simultaneous listening to commonalities and differences.

Ratcliffe draws upon Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke’s theory of identification to gear toward examining the differences in identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related to the issue of connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes “impossibly confused and finally untenable.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss further builds the connection between identification and disidentification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fuss defines disidentification as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, while at the same time the identification has receded from the subconscious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] and Fuss’s (dis)identification. Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of [[metonymy]] is an attention to both commonalities and differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Practical applications of Burke’s “identification” can be seen in the scholarly effort to reframe identifications. Assembling essays from the fifth Biennial Rhetoric Society of America Conference, Michelle Ballif addresses Ratcliffe’s call for rethinking Burke’s notion of identification “as a place of perpetual reframing that affects who, how, and what can be thought, spoken, written, and imagined.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re/Framing Identification|last=Ballif|first=Michelle|publisher=Waveland|year=2014|isbn=9781478606710|location=Long Grove|pages=1, 200, 309}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the essay contributors draw upon Burke’s theory to reinterpret social identifications, others turn to specific social actions to reread Burke’s “identification.” For instance, following Ratcliffe’s critique of Burke’s theory for its lack of attention to difference, Dominic J. Ashby destabilizes Burke’s relatively fixed and teleological construction of identification with “a fluid and contingent notion of self”—that is, “uchi/soto,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or inside/outside in Japanese rhetoric—highlighting a simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of outsiders through an ongoing unfolding of group dynamics. By way of analyzing the Facebook news feed of “We are all Khaled Said,” Katherine Bridgman expands Burkean identification to “embodiment,”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or the mutually coordinated experience between speakers and their audiences triggered by specific circumstances. Along a similar vein, critiquing Burke’s [[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|consubstantiality]] for being sexually indifferent, Janice Odom draws from Irigaray’s feminist theories to reframe identification as a playground of sexual dominance and surrender.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare''' (ISEW) is an [[economics|economic]] indicator intended to replace the [[Gross Domestic Product]], which is the main macroeconomic indicator of System of National Accounts (SNA).
Rather than simply adding together all expenditures like the [[gross domestic product]], [[consumer expenditure]] is balanced by such factors as income distribution and cost associated with pollution and other  unsustainable costs. It is similar to the [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]].

The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is roughly defined by the following formula.

''ISEW'' = ''personal consumption''&lt;br&gt;+ ''public non-defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;- ''private defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;+ ''capital formation''&lt;br&gt;+ ''services from domestic labour''&lt;br&gt;- ''costs of [[environmental degradation]]''&lt;br&gt;- ''depreciation of [[natural capital]]''

==History==
GDP is misleading as an indicator or even as a proxy of the welfare of a nation, let alone as a measure of people’s well-being,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wuppertal Institute |title=Alternatives to GDP for Measuring Progress |url=https://https//epub.wupperinst.org/files/3486/WS42.pdf |website=Wuppertal Institute |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the makers of economic policy commonly think to the contrary. This problem already became apparent in practical economic policies in most{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} industrialised countries in the early 1970s. The most famous examples of this development are the MEW index developed by [[William Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]] in their [[Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW)]] in 1972, the Japanese Net National Welfare (NNW) indicator in 1973, the Economic Aspects of Welfare index (EAW)  index of Zolatas in 1981, the ISEW indicator of Daly and Cobb in 1989 and the UN’s human development index, or HDI, in 1990{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. They are all based on neoclassical welfare economics and use as the starting point the System of National Accounts (SNA). The basic idea behind all these approaches is the inclusion of nonmarket commodities, positive and negative, to yield an aggregated macroindicator in monetary terms.

The EAW index, applied to the United States for the period from 1950 to 1977, showed that the economic aspects of social welfare are a diminishing function of economic growth in industrially mature, affluent societies{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The percentage increases in social welfare over time are smaller than the corresponding increases in the GDP, and are diminishing{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. When the elasticity of the EAW/GDP ratio reaches zero, economic welfare will have attained its maximum value. Beyond that point any further increase in the GDP would lead to an absolute decline in economic welfare.

The ISEW was originally developed in 1989 by leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] and theologian [[John B. Cobb]], but later they went on to add several other "costs" to the definition of ISEW{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. This later work resulted in yet another macroeconomic indicator [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]]: see [[sustainability measurement]]. The GPI is an extension of ISEW that stresses genuine and real progress of the society and seeks especially to monitor welfare and the ecological sustainability of the economy. The ISEW and GPI summarise economic welfare by means of a single figure according to the same logic by which GDP summarises economic output into a single figure. Beside economic issues, social and environmental issues in monetary terms are included.

==Trend of ISEW in the United States==

The calculation of the ISEW in the United States from 1950 to 1986 was done by Cobb and Daly in 1989. The results reveal that the increase in economic welfare of an average American has stabilised after the 1970s although the economy, measured by GDP, has continued to grow. According to Cobb and Daly’s calculations the external effects of production and the inequity of income distribution are the main reasons for this development in which an increase in production does not necessarily lead to an increase in welfare.

==Other countries to adopt ISEW==

Besides the USA there have been at least seven other countries or regions which have attempted to implement the ISEW, namely the UK (Jackson &amp; Marks 1994), Germany (Diefenbacher 1994), The Netherlands (Rosenberg &amp; Oegema 1995), Austria (Stockhammer et al. 1995), British Columbia (Gustavson &amp; Lonergan 1994), Sweden (Jackson &amp; Stymne 1996), Chile (Castaneda 1999) and Finland (Hoffrén 2001).

==Progress of the Finnish ISEW ==

The calculation of the ISEW for Finland has been done by Dr. Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland in 2001 [http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/67162]. Today the time period covered is extended to years from 1945 to 2010. According to results sustainable economic welfare rose steadily in the 1970s and early 1980s, but has since declined and stabilised. One of the underlying reasons for this development was effective income distribution which apportioned evenly the welfare derived from increased production. In the mid-1980s income disparities started to grow again, flows of capital (investments) abroad increased and environmental hazards escalated, resulting in a decline in the weighted personal consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Integrated Chain Management''' (ICM), also known as '''Integral Chain Management''', is an approach for the reduction of environmental impact of product chains. Such a product chain exists out of an extraction phase, a production phase, a use phase and a waste phase. The ultimate goal of ICM is a reduction of environmental load over the whole chain. Integrated Chain Management is one of the approaches that can be used to come to [[sustainable development]]. Other approaches in this line are the [[Ecological Footprint]] and the [[DTO approach]]. 

Within the ICM approach all phases within the chain must be considered.  Therefore it can be seen as a "cradle to grave" approach. 
Several inputs and outputs can be taken into account when applying the ICM approach. Such as: Energy flows, mass flows, materials, waste flows and emissions.  Within ICM material cycles should be closed where possible and the remainder flows of [[air pollution|emissions]] and waste should be brought within acceptable boundaries. Also the use of resources should be kept to a minimum.  

Integrated chain management should not be mixed up with [[Supply Chain Management]] or [[Integrated Supply Chain Management]]. These concepts do not have the reduction of environmental load as their main goal. 

An important aspect of ICM is that shifting to other phases in the product chain is avoided. For instance, a producer of chairs can choose to leave off an environment unfriendly material in a new product. The producer can even see this as an extra selling point for the customer, but as a consequence the supplier of raw materials has to use much more energy to produce a material with the same qualities. The result of this is that there may no longer be a net environmental reduction across the whole chain. Within the integrated chain management approach this is avoided. 

The chain can be managed by developing new policies and economical or political incentives. Therefore one must have insight into the inputs and outputs of the production chain. Before these policies can be developed one must engage in several actions.  

*Analyse the processes into a preferred level of detail
*Determine the boundaries of the chain. Should links outside the companies be involved as well? 
*Determine whether there should be a focus on just one or on several environmental problems
*Determine on which material flows or energy flows there should be a focus. 

Effective supply chain management can impact virtually all business and production processes

==Example==
An example of applying the ICM approach would be to develop policies in a particular product area. The responsibility of problems caused by the waste stage can be assigned to the producers of these products. This leads to improved product design and new insight in how to put these products in the market. For instance the product can be sold with a disposal contribution. On the price tag of a radio nowadays can be printed:  "this radio costs 25 $ not including the 3 $ disposal contribution" 
The effects can be seen within the whole chain. The producer will try to choose non-polluting materials, as they increase the costs of the waste-stage. The producer of raw materials will try to improve its production process in order to meet the increased demand for 'clean' primary products. And the consumer will be aware that some products give more pressure on the environment than others when its economical lifespan has run out.

Internet sex addiction can have several causes according to the American Association for Sex Addition Therapy. The first cause is the neural physiological attachment that occurs during orgasms -  reinforcing and attaching the images or scenarios to the addictive behavior concurrently. Secondly, psychological defects like abandonment, unimportance or lack of genuine attachment are sometimes medicated by the instances of sex addiction behavior. Thirdly, the internet sex addict may be using the addiction to balance a legitimate chemical imbalance due to major depression, a bipolar disorder or a manic depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aasat.org/|title=SRT Training &amp; Certification {{!}} Sexual Recovery Therapist {{!}} AASAT|website=American Association for Sex Addiction Therapy|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cybersex addict may also struggle with [[intimacy anorexia]] since the cyber world feels safer than real relationships.

==General==

[[Cybersex]] addiction is a form of [[sexual addiction]] and [[Internet addiction disorder]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt; As a form of a [[compulsive behavior]], it can be identified by three criteria: the failure of making a decision about engagement in the behavior, obsession with the behavior, and the inability to stop the behavior despite negative consequences.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

Adults with this type of addiction, engage in at least one of the relevant behaviors. The majority of reasons why individuals experiment with such forms of sexual expression are diverse, and can be associated with an individual's [[psychological disorders]] or issues. Individuals who suffer from [[low self-esteem]], severely distorted [[body image]], untreated [[sexual dysfunction]], social isolation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or are in recovery from a prior [[sexual addiction]] are more vulnerable to cybersexual addictions.&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt;&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Alvin|author2=Coralie R. Scherer |author3=Sylvain C. Boies |author4=Barry L. Gordon |title=Sexuality on the Internet: From Sexual Exploration to Pathological Expression.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=April 1999|volume=30|issue=1|pages=154–164|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info/details-sfx.xqy?uri=/07357028/v30i0002/154_sotifsetpe.xml|accessdate=2 April 2013 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other psychological issues that may arise with this addiction include struggles for intimacy, self-worth, [[self-identity]], self-understanding.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

The impact of cybersex addiction may also impact the spouse, partner or others in relationships with the addict. The resulting effects on others may include depression, weight gain and lower self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Partners: Healing From His Addiction|last=Weiss|first=Douglas|publisher=Discovery Press|year=2011|isbn=1-881292-34-7|location=Colorado Springs, CO 80949|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If cyber sex addicts have children, their actions may also impact those children (whether they are grown adult children or younger dependents).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57754066|title=Beyond the bedroom : healing for adult children of sex addicts|last=Douglas.|first=Weiss,|date=2005|publisher=Health Communications|year=|isbn=0757303250|location=Deerfield Beach, FL|pages=17-21|oclc=57754066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM classification==
There is an ongoing debate in the medical community concerning the insufficient studies, and of those, their quality, or lack thereof, and the resulting analysis and conclusions drawn from them, such as they are. So far, without repeatable, meaningful, measurable, and quantifiable analysis, no medical community wide acceptably reasonable standards, a definition, have been drawn yet.

Hence, internet sex addiction, just like it's umbrella [[sexual addiction]], is still not listed in the [[DSM-5]],&lt;ref name=dsm-5&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last= American Psychiatric Association |year= 2013 |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= Fifth |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington, VA |pages= 797–798 |isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used by psychiatrists in the United States for diagnosing patients problems in a standard uniform way.

'''Joseph Pitts''' (1663–1735?) was an Englishman who was taken into slavery by Barbary pirates from Algeria in 1678 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Little is known about Pitts aside from what is revealed in his narrative concerning his time held captive in Northern Africa, during which time he went through three masters ranging widely in their cruelty towards him over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Joseph. ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' (1704) reprinted in ''Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England'', ed. Daniel J. Vitkus (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 218–340&lt;/ref&gt; Converting to the religion while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa (whom he calls Turks or Mohammetans) in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Though its accuracy is debatable, Pitts’s narrative was the first and most detailed description of the religion of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.

== Pitts and the hajj ==

It was during Pitts’s time with his last master that he made his journey to [[Mecca]] to complete the [[hajj]]. Having converted to Islam under the urgings and tortures of his second master Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many of the aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary but not mandatory visit to [[Medina]]. Much of Pitts's account of the hajj can be verified as accurate, but there is debate as to the truthfulness of some of his relations.

=== Initial rites ===

As a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the [[Zamzam Well]], and completion of the sa 'y or sa 'i. Scholars seem to disagree as to what brought about this tradition, whether a re-enactment of Mohammad's reclaiming of the temple for Islam or that of the seven planets rotating around the sun.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca"&gt;''Inside Mecca''. Dir. Taghi Amirani &amp; Anisa Mehdi. National Geographic Television, 2003. DVD; Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the real reasoning or meaning behind the seven turnings around the Ka ‘ba, it became a part of the Islamic tradition of the hajj and was being performed by pilgrims immediately upon their arrival well before Pitts’s time. After this ritual is the cleansing at the Zamzam Well, something Pitts seems to have left out of his narrative. Peters describes the Islamic legend tracing the origins of this well to a time when Abraham’s wife Hagar was left in the middle of the desert with their son Ishmael who was dying of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=F.E.|title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|pages=197 &amp; 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperately running back and forth in search of water between two low hills called Safa and Marwa, God brought forth water from a spot in the desert for Hagar to give to her child.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt; An example of this interaction with the Zamzam Well shortly after the tawaf can be found in an account by Ali Bey al-Abbasi, a Spaniard who went on the hajj in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. 146 &amp; 149; Peters, F.E. ''The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 197 &amp; 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of his narrative, Pitts mentions the drinking of the water but not in connection with these initial rites. Whether this is due to a mistake by Pitts or a genuine difference in the order of the hajj of the 1600s is hard to determine. However, this initial water rite then brings pilgrims to what is called the sa ‘y, a recreation of Hagar’s desperate search for water which they complete by running back and forth between the same hills seven times. Today this is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts’s time and up until the 1950s, this was completed out on the street.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt;

=== Mount Arafat ===

The vigil at Mount Arafat is another important aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is the “how, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense," Pitts claims that as to "why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges" he did not know, adding he gave "but little heed to these delusions."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, "A True and Faithful Account", Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how "they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trauma ==

Pitts was subject to numerous forms of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] during his enslavement.  These included:

* [[Blunt trauma|Physical trauma]], when he was repeatedly beaten by his patrons.
* [[Slavery|Enslavement]] trauma, described by Orlando Patterson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Orlando|title=Slavery and Social Death|year=1982|publisher=Harvard College|location=Cambridge|isbn=067481083X|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of social death, wherein trauma is derived from the severance from any form of autonomy.
* [[Adoption]] trauma, wherein there is a traumatic component to being separated from the parent and later adopted by another.  Pitts's adoption, in emotion if not in law, by his third patroon had traumatic ramifications on Pitts' [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. 
Due to these traumatic experiences Pitts developed a form of [[PTSD]].  Many scholars of memoir and PTSD have noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peres|first=Julio F. P.|author2=Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Antonia Gladys Nasello and Harold G. Koenig|title=Spirituality and Resilience in Trauma Victims|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|year=2007|pages=343–350|doi=10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=Margaret|title=Adoption Narratives, Trauma and Origins|journal=Narrative|date=January 2006|volume=14|pages=4–26|doi=10.1353/nar.2005.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the memoirs of the traumatised often take the form of a "working out" of the trauma, an examination of the causes and meanings of the trauma by a slow and steady examination of events to make sense of them.  This reflects itself in Pitts's writing in the slow and steady buildup to the chapters that talk about the incidents of severe trauma, such as the beating received from his first and second masters and the emotional complexities of his [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]] and later adoption.

== Sexuality, women, and slavery in Pitts's narrative ==

Pitts does not often mention women in his writings. It appears there are very few opportunities for him to be around women of any sort of status. However, the encounters he does write about give good insight into the Western views of Islamic attitudes about women. Pitts is not a stranger to violence. He is captured, enslaved, tortured, sold, and endures countless hardships throughout his journey. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps. He writes that the soldiers are "apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy…" (236). In this passage, and in the context surrounding it, Pitts only mentions the danger to women once and focuses more acutely on the sin of sodomy amongst the soldiers. This shows that sexual violence is normalised for Pitts; he is much more concerned about the sin of sodomy than the sin of rape. He focuses intently on the immorality of sodomy but says nothing of the immorality of raping a woman.

In his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men (242). He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas (243). These notions of power in relation to females are very much based in English ideas. Women in England gave up their property and dowries to their husbands upon marriage. Divorce was not common nor easy in England, although Pitts never details if a woman is allowed to ask for a divorce. Multiple wives were not as common among the middle and lower class of Muslim society; if Pitts did not rub elbows with the elite he would not have seen this phenomenon.

Pitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as "Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts" (270). These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction.  The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave.

== Pitts and his masters ==

Pitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. Not very much insight is given of his first master, but we do know that his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly (318).&lt;ref name="Pitts1704"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Joseph|title=A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive|year=1704|publisher=Exon|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that they were fed was equal to the treatment they received. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered. A man who was suspected of the idea of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‘The captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also’ (228).  Ellen Friedman points out that the free Muslim man’s diet was no better than the captives’.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ellen|title=Christian Captive at Hard Labor|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman also addresses that captives were treated harshly to make certain that they were kept in line and knew their place. Their self-worth was often undermined and the captives would be humiliated in front of their companions. Robert Davis, in the book ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy'', says that ceaseless beatings and humiliation are established at the beginning of the capture to not only frighten new slaves, but to ensure silent obedience as well. Many slaves watched as their companions were reprimanded into bloody unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Robert|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|publisher=Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ narrative then turns to the forcing of converting to Islam. He states: ‘It hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.’ While this is deemed true, there are rare cases like Pitts who have been forced into conversion. His second master, Ibrahim, had hung Pitts upside down, revealing the bottoms of his bare feet and dealing out 300 blows with a cudgel. Though Pitts had changed religions, Ibrahim treated him just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until his blood poured onto the ground. This type of treatment was unusual. The Qur'an instructs masters to treat their slaves with firm kindness. Though they might not have shared the same expectations about work and life, master and slaves mutually understood and shared “a bundle of mutual obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=The Ideology of Slavery in Africa|year=1981|publisher=Beverly Hills: Sage Publications|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were meant to be kept healthy to work efficiently. If slaves were unproductive in their line of work, then they would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen G. "Christian Captive at Hard Labor." ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'' 13.4 (n.d.): 616-32; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ third and last master was more of an ideal master. While Pitts wanted nothing to do with his master from the beginning, he soon became affectionate towards him when he saw that the master intended to give him a letter of freedom (323). Pitts describes his master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives to love. Pitts also saw him in a fatherly light and, after given the letter of freedom, continued to stay with him for he was so kind. Freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. Even serious sins such as murder could be forgiven by the freeing of a slave. When Pitts makes the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he becomes conflicted with the situation of whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death (332).

== Controversy ==

=== Conversion ===

At the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced or tricked into converting to Islam. However, research suggests that such claims were likely to be false. Research suggests that North Africa was religiously very tolerant at this time and that Christian captives who converted were likely to benefit from lying about having converted because the English Christians—their own families included—would have persecuted them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity: Narrations of Conversion and the Creation of the Early Modern Renegade." ''Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East'' 29.2 (2009): 259–268. Project MUSE. Web. 1 March 2013. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research suggests that Pitts might have done the same and that Pitts's alleged experience of having been forcibly converted would have been a special case, if true at all. More research, suggesting that Islam and renegades were often vilified in British culture and media, gives Pitts another reason to have lied about his conversion. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries.&lt;ref&gt;Matar, Nabil. "The Renegade in English Seventeenth-Century Imagination." ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900''. 33.3 (1993): 489–505; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101; Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;  In direct reference to Pitts's writings, some research brings up the way that Pitts admitted to having been tempted to remain a Muslim, as well as admitting to the advantages offered him by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical abuse ===

There is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters.  Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts’s account.  Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytisation would have been illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity."&lt;/ref&gt; A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted.  The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.

Other scholars, such as Robert Davis, also doubt the validity of many slave narratives while allowing that the use of violence against one slave served “as a warning to all the other slaves who might witness or hear of it to be on their best behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert C. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitts himself discredits the forced conversion trope, stating that this was a rare occurrence, “though it was my hard fortune to be so unmercifully dealt with.” However, Pitts provides a reason why his masters would have used violent force against him, namely that one of his masters had a sordid past and hoped to unburden his sins by forcing Pitts to convert and then freeing him, a holy rite within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megalithic Observatory Kokino.jpg|thumb|220px|The summit of Tatićev Kamen]]
'''Kokino''' ({{lang-mk|Кокино}}) is a [[Bronze Age Balkans|Bronze Age]] archaeological site in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km from the town of [[Kumanovo]], and about 6&amp;nbsp;km from the Serbian border, in the [[Staro Nagoričane]] municipality. It is situated between about 1010 and 1030 m above sea level on the Tatićev Kamen (Татиќев камен) summit and covers an area of about 90 by 50 meters, overlooking the eponymous hamlet of [[Kokino (Staro Nagoričane)|Kokino]].

It was discovered by archeologist Jovica Stankovski, director of the national museum in [[Kumanovo]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the Macedonian Archaeological Association [http://mand.org.mk/mk/clen.php?id=153 МАНД], Jovica Stankovski (Јовица Станковски), born 13 January 1948 in Kumanovo, diploma in mechanical engineering in 1975, diploma in art history and archaeology in 1986, from 1999 to 2003 director of the national museum in Kumanovo.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. In 2002, Stankovski together with Gorje Cenev (who is the head of a planetarium at a [http://mkc.mk/ Youth Cultural Center] in Skopje) published the claim that the site contains a "[[megalithic]] [[Astronomical complex|observatory]] and [[Prehistoric religion#Bronze Age Europe|sacred site]]" (мегалитска опсерваторија и светилиште).

The wider Kokino archaeological site covers about 30 hectares. The oldest archaeological finds date from about the 19th century BC, corresponding to the early European Bronze Age. It shows signs of occupation for the period from the 19th to the 7th centuries BC. Finds from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 16th to 14th centuries BC) are the most numerous (mainly ceramic vessels, stone-mills, a few molds, and a pendant). An agglomeration from the [[Iron Age Balkans|Iron Age]] was discovered in 2009.&lt;ref name="BalkanTravellers"&gt;[http://www.balkantravellers.com/en/read/article/1240 Macedonia: Iron Period Layers Revealed by Latest Archaeology Excavations at Kokino] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606125955/http://www.balkantravellers.com/en/read/article/1240 |date=2009-06-06 }}, BalkanTravellers.com, 29 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of vessels filled with offerings were found deposited in cracks in the rocks, which gave rise to the interpretation of the site as a "holy mountain".

The Kokino "megalithic observatory" should be distinguished from the wider Kokino archaeological site. The claimed archaeoastronomical site has a combined area of about 5000 square meters and consists of two platforms with an elevation difference of 19 meters. The claim of the site representing an astronomical observatory was made by Stankovski and by Gjore Cenev in 2002. According to this interpretation, the site includes special stone markers used to track the movement of the Sun and Moon on the eastern horizon. The observatory used the method of stationary observation, marking positions of the Sun at the winter and summer [[solstice]], as well as the [[equinox]]. Four stone seats or "thrones" are placed in a row on the lower platform. According to Cenev, a stone block with a marking on the upper platform marks the direction of sunrise on summer solstice when viewed from one of the seats. Kokino was briefly mentioned in a poster made by [[NASA]]'s "Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum" in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2005/images/ao_poster.pdf Ancient Observatories - Timeless Knowledge]; Kokino is listed among fifteen "Ancient Observatory Sites" on this poster. This was reported in terms of "[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2005/05/11/feature-02 Macedonia's Megalithic Kokino Observatory Places 4th on NASA List]" by , Marija Lazarova for [[Southeast European Times]] in Skopje (11 May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; although in a recent survey of ancient "observatories", the Kokino site was described as "a particularly problematic case".&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Belmonte | first = Juan Antonio | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L.

The Cultural Heritage Protection Office of Macedonia's Ministry of Culture declared the site a "property under temporary protection" on  13 November 2008 (Decision nr. 08-1935/6). In 2009, Minister of Culture Elizabeta Kancheska-Milevska declared Kokino "one of the priorities of the Ministry of Culture’s 2009 programme".&lt;ref name="BalkanTravellers"/&gt; In 2009, the Republic of Macedonia also suggested the site be inscribed on the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site list]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5413 Archaeo-astronomical Site Kokino],  World Heritage Centre "Tentative List", Ref. 5413.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">'''Lamellar phase''' refers generally to packing of [[Chemical polarity|polar]]-headed long chain nonpolar-tail [[molecule]]s in an environment of bulk polar liquid, as sheets of bilayers separated by bulk liquid. In [[biophysics]], polar lipids (mostly, [[phospholipids]], and rarely, [[glycolipids]]) pack as a [[liquid crystal]]line [[bilayer]], with [[hydrophobic]] fatty [[acyl]] long chains directed inwardly and polar headgroups of [[lipid]]s aligned on the outside in contact with water, as a 2-dimensional flat sheet surface.  Under [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM), after staining with polar headgroup reactive chemical [[osmium tetroxide]], lamellar lipid phase appears as two thin parallel dark staining lines/sheets, constituted by aligned polar headgroups  of lipids. 'Sandwiched' between these two parallel lines, there exists one thicker line/sheet of non-staining closely packed layer of long lipid fatty acyl chains. This TEM-appearance became famous as Robertson's unit membrane - the basis of all [[biological membranes]], and structure of [[lipid bilayer]] in  [[unilamellar liposome]]s. In multilamellar [[liposomes]], many such lipid bilayer sheets are layered concentrically with water layers in between.

[[File:Lamellar phase lipids (original research work of Dr. R.C. YashRoy).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 1 Multi-lamellar phase of aqueous lipid dispersions, each white lamella represents a [[lipid bilayer]] organization in [[liposome]] made by vortex-mixing of dried total lipid extract of spinach [[thylakoid]] membranes with distilled water. Phosphotungstic acid [[negative stain]]ed sample viewed with [[transmission electron microscopy]] technique.]]

In lamellar lipid bilayers, polar headgroups of lipids align together at the interface of water and hydrophobic [[fatty-acid]] [[acyl]] chains align parallel to one another 'hiding away' from water. The lipid head groups are somewhat more 'tightly' packed than relatively 'fluid' hydrocarbon fatty acyl long chains. The lamellar lipid bilayer organization, thus reveals a 'flexibility gradient' of increasing freedom of motions from near the head-groups towards the terminal fatty-acyl chain methyl groups. Existence of such a dynamic organization of lamellar phase in liposomes as well as biological membranes can be confirmed by [[spin label]] [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] and high resolution [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[spectroscopy]] studies of biological membranes and liposomes.&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R C (1990) Magnetic resonance studies of dynamic organisation of lipids in chloroplast membranes. ''Journal of Biosciences'', vol. 15 (No.4), pp. 281-288.https://www.academia.edu/7327415/YashRoy_R_C_1990_Magnetic_resonance_studies_of_dynamic_organisation_of_lipids_in_chloro-_plast_membranes._Journal_of_Biosciences._Vol._15_No._4_pp._281-288&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'soft matter science', where physics and chemistry meet biological science, a bilayer lamellar phase has been recently created from fluorinated silica, and it has been projected for use as a shear-thinning [[lubricant]].&lt;ref&gt;Pottage M J, Kasuma T, Grillo I, Gravey C J, Stickland A D and Tabor R F (2014) Fluorinated lamellar phases: Structural characterization and use as templates for highly ordered silica materials.

==Theoretical background==

There are many different theoretical models proposed to explain the occurrence of primacy and recency effects.

=== Sensory-variation===
Schultz (1963) developed the "sensory-variation" hypothesis for order effects, which suggests that humans seek high activation and will respond to novel stimuli more strongly than to stimuli they are familiar with. Novel stimuli should provide higher activation than familiar information, according to this theory. Shultz developed four postulates from this general hypothesis: 
# When a person encounters a topic for the first time, the communication is perceived as novel and causes high activation. Any subsequent communication on the same topic produces less activation, and so the person will react according to the initial communication in an attempt to experience the higher activation. A primacy effect should be observed in this scenario.
# If the person is allowed to record his opinion after each communication, the person will respond more to the communication that he encounters either second in a group of two or last in a group of three or more  in order to maintain a high level of activation. Therefore, a recency effect is hypothesized. 
# When a time delay or another task is inserted between the two communications, the higher level of activation will be dissipated by the time the second communication occurs. The second communication acts as a novel stimulus in this scenario. Either a recency effect or no order effect will occur in this scenario. 
# When communications are familiar, such as social issues or current issues, the first communication will not produce activation that is less than the activation for unfamiliar communication. However, some aspect of the communication may be novel, and so there may be some increased activation. Therefore, either a small primacy effect or no  order effect will be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schultz, D. P.|year=1963|title=Primacy-recency within a sensory variation framework|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=13|issue=2|pp=129–139|doi=10.1007/BF03393511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention decrement===

Anderson (1981) theorized that order effects occur due to "attention decrement". According to this theory,  when the first piece of information is presented about an opinion, people tend to pay less attention to subsequent information that may provide evidence to the contrary opinion. Therefore, people's opinions about something are influenced strongly by the information that they paid attention to, which was the first information presented to them. This model of "attention decrement" predicts a primacy effect in opinion formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, N.H.|year=1981|title=Foundations of information integration theory|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The belief-adjustment model===
Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) proposed the belief-adjustment model to try to predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based on the type of mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hogarth, R. M.|author2=Einhorn, H. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Order effects in belief updating: The belief-adjustment model|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pp=1–55|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90002-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when processing changes to step-by-step processing, or processing that occurs after each new piece of information, recency effects are predicted. Each new piece of information received will be processed separately. This new piece of information will then become the new anchor, which forms a new impression. Beliefs are being adjusted with the processing of each new anchor, which leads to more weight being placed to the information most recently received. Therefore, recency effects are predicted to occur when information is processed in a step-by-step manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Factors that moderate order effects==

There are factors that can [[Moderation (statistics)|moderate]] the occurrence of order effects. Moderating factors affect the likelihood of order effects occurring.

===Need for cognition===

[[Need for cognition]] moderates the occurrence of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror's need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by one side of the case, and then both sides commented that the confession fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented the confession spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed the confession fit with whichever side presented the confession as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that the confession supported the case for the side who did not submit the confession.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kassin, S. M.|author2=Reddy, M. E.|author3=Tulloch, W. F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Juror interpretations of ambiguous evidence: The need for cognition, presentation order, and persuasion|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=14|issue=1|pp=43–55|doi=10.1007/BF01055788|jstor=1393555|url=http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_Reddy_Tulloch_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) believed that the reason for this effect was due to the nature of processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads to agreeing with the initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This impact of need for cognition is supported by a study conducted by Huagtvedt and Petty (1992). The experimenters played a message for two groups of people, one group that was high in need for cognition and one group that was low in need for cognition. The two groups were determined by their own need for cognition, and were not experimentally manipulated into the two groups. Initially, both groups were equally persuaded by the message. However, the two groups then listened to a weak counter-message, which was not as strong as the evidence for the initial message. The group that had high need for cognition were not persuaded by the weak counter-message, and their opinions were still in line with the initial message. The other group, the low need for cognition group, was persuaded by the new message. The high need for cognition demonstrated a primacy effect, while the low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haugtvedt, C. P.|author2=Petty, R. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Personality and persuasion: Need for cognition moderates the persistence and resistance of attitude changes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=2|p=308|url=http://psyc604.stasson.org/haugtvedt.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chunking===
[[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]] interacts with the order of information and need for cognition to moderate the occurrence of order effects. Petty, Tormala, Hawkins, and Wegener (2001) conducted a study which examined the effect chunking has on order effects in people with high and low need for cognition. Participants read arguments for and against an exam policy, and this information was presented as being either chunked or unchunked. When the information was chunked, those who show high need for cognition were prone to primacy effects, while those with low need for cognition were prone to recency effects. However, when the information was presented in an unchunked nature, the opposite results were found. People who had high need for cognition demonstrated recency effects, whereas people who had low need for cognition showed a primacy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Petty, R. E.|author2=Tormala, Z. L.|author3=Hawkins, C.|author4=Wegener, D. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Motivation to think and order effects in persuasion: The moderating role of chunking|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=3|pp=332–344|doi=10.1177/0146167201273007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745085_Motivation_to_Think_and_Order_Effects_in_Persuasion_The_Moderating_Role_of_Chunking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, chunking appears to interact with need for cognition to allow for order effects to occur.

===Familiarity of information===

A study conducted by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In the study, a topic of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with the topic and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with the topic. A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against the topic twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for the topic first and then the argument against the topic, and the second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a [[Likert scale]] questionnaire on their opinions on the topic. The results show that prior familiarization with a topic increased the likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on the topic that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, R. E. |year=1961|title=Familiarity and the order of presentation of persuasive communications|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=62|issue=3|pp=573–577|doi=10.1037/h0046634|pmid=14461892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy of the topic===

A study conducted by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students and high school students read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the presentation of arguments for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, Robert E.|year=1963|title=Controversy of the topic and the order of presentation in persuasive communications|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=12|issue=1|pp=163–170|doi=10.2466/pr0.1963.12.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in judgment formation==

===Sports===

Smith, Greenlees, and Manley (2009) found that order effects can occur in assessment of sports ability. The researchers had participants watch a video composed of an [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] player performing certain skills. Two videos were shown, either in descending ability or increasing ability. The participants were then asked to make assessments of the overall ability of the players and three aspects of their ability. However, the assessments occurred at differing times in the video. One group made the assessments at the end of the video, one group made delayed assessments at the end of the video, a third group made the assessments after each skill in the video, and a fourth group that made the overall assessment after each skill but then made the assessment of the ability after viewing the entire video. Results indicate that a primacy effect was exhibited in each of the conditions, except for the third group, which did not demonstrate any order effects. The assessment of ability tended to agree with the initial ability level shown. However, the group that made assessments in an extended step-by-step manner were not influenced by the order the abilities were shown. Therefore, a primacy effect can occur in ability assessment, unless extended step-by-step processing is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, M. J.|author2=Greenlees, I.|author3=Manley, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Influence of order effects and mode of judgement on assessments of ability in sport|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=27|issue=7|pp=745–752|doi=10.1080/02640410902939647|pmid=19437187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service encounters===

In a study conducted by Garnefeld and Steinhoff (2013), order effects were demonstrated for opinions regarding service encounters. Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then tested for customer satisfaction regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnefeld, I.|author2=Steinhoff, L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Primacy versus recency effects in extended service encounters|journal=Journal of Service Management|volume=24|issue=1|pp=64–81|doi=10.1108/09564231311304198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in health care==

Order effects may be used to influence a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group received information in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups received information ordered based on their values. One of the groups received information that aligned with their values first, and the other group received information that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients receive information appears to influence which treatment option they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bansback, N.|author2=Li L. C.|author3=Lynd, L.|author4=Bryan S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=Exploiting order effects to improve  the quality of decisions|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|volume=96|issue=2|pp=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.021|pmid=24961445|url=http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(14)00226-2/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in politics==
===Voter mobilization===

In a study conducted by Panagopoulos (2010), order effects were found in terms of voter mobilization. Calls were made to residents of an American city at different times before an election. Some residents received a call 4 weeks prior to an election, some received a call two weeks prior to an election, some received a call three days before an election, and some residents did not receive a call. The call made was a nonpartisan attempt to mobilize people to vote. Results indicate that the timing of the call may not have an effect on the general voter population, but that the timing can affect certain populations and get certain populations to vote at higher rates. According to Panagopoulos, high-propensity voters, voters who typically turn out in higher numbers, voted at higher percentages when they received the call four weeks prior to the election, demonstrating a primacy effect. However, for lower propensity voters, voters who typically do not vote, calls made three days prior to the election were more effective at getting this population to vote, demonstrating a recency effect. Therefore, for voter mobilization, propensity to vote appears to be a moderating variable influencing the effect of timing of a mobilization call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panagopoulos, C.|year=2011|title=Timing Is Everything?

'''Loudness monitoring''' of [[programme levels]] is needed in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]], as well as in [[audio post production]]. Traditional methods of measuring signal levels, such as the [[Peak programme meter]] and [[VU meter]], do not give the subjectively valid measure of [[loudness]] that many would argue is needed to optimise the listening experience when changing channels or swapping disks.

The need for proper loudness monitoring is apparent in the [[loudness war]] that is now found everywhere in the audio field, and the extreme compression that is now applied to [[programme levels]].

==Loudness meters==
Meters have been introduced that aim to measure the human perceived loudness by taking account of the [[equal-loudness contours]] and other factors, such as audio spectrum, duration, compression and intensity. One such device was developed by [[CBS Laboratories]] in the 1980s. Complaints to broadcasters about the intrusive level of interstitials programs (advertisements, commercials) has resulted in projects to develop such meters. Based on loudness metering, many manufacturers have developed real-time audio processors that adjust the audio signal to match a specified target loudness level that preserves volume consistency at home listeners.

==EBU Mode meters==
In August 2010, the European Broadcasting Union published a new metering specification [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341], which builds on [[ITU-R BS.1770]]. To make sure meters from different manufacturers provide the same reading in [[LUFS]] units, [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341] specifies the 'EBU Mode', which includes a Momentary (400 ms), Short term (3s) and Integrated (from start to stop) meter and a [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/testmaterial/ebu-loudness-test-setv03.zip set of audiosignals] to test the meters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">'''Meagher Electronics''' was a [[Monterey, California]], company which was founded in 1947 by Jim Meagher. It included a recording studio which recorded early demos for [[Joan Baez]], her sister, [[Mimi Farina]] and her sister's husband, [[Richard Farina]].  The company also repaired all sorts of home entertainment equipment, focusing on professional and semi professional sound equipment and high end home systems.  It had a huge, high warehouse space in which literally hundreds of old wooden console radios and phonographs dating back to the 1920s were stacked to the rafters. Meagher used to explain that these had been left by customers who chose not to pick them up instead of paying the repair estimate charges.

The firm was also a commercial sound installation company and one of the first [[Altec Lansing]] dealers in the country, with catalogues and equipment going back to 1947. It provided the sound system for most of the concerts and live events in the Monterey area in the 1950s through the 1970s, from folk to jazz to [[Roger Williams (pianist)|Roger Williams]]  It also recorded the first gold jazz album, [[Erroll Garner]]'s ''[[Concert by the Sea]]'' in the mid-1950s on a portable mono [[Ampex]] [[Ampex 601|601]] tape recorder which remained a prize possession for many years.

The [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] contracted Meagher to provide their [[sound reinforcement system]] from the beginning of its existence in 1958 and the firm was extremely conscientious about providing the best quality sound possible, often using recording quality condenser microphones and custom designed loudspeaker arrays.  The company supplied sound reinforcement systems for the [[Big Sur]] [[Folk Festival]]s and assisted [[McCune Sound Service|Harry McCune Sound]] from San Francisco and their employees [[Abe Jacob]] and [[John Meyer (audio engineer)|John Meyer]], who were contracted to provide the sound system for the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, because of their experience in setting up high intensity systems in venues such as the [[Winterland Ballroom]] and [[The Fillmore]].

'''Memory improvement''' is the act of improving one's memory.

Medical research of memory deficits and age-related [[memory loss]] has resulted in new explanations and treatment techniques to improve memory, including [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[stress management]], [[cognitive therapy]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical medications]].  [[Neuroimaging]] as well as [[cognitive neuroscience]] have provided [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] evidence supporting [[Holism|holistic]] ways in which one can improve memory.

==Memory function factors==

=== Neuro plasticity===
[[Neuroplasticity]] is the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience, learns new behaviours and relearns lost behaviour if the brain has been damaged.&lt;ref name="Kleim"&gt;Kleim, JA., &amp; Jones, TA. (2008). [http://www.bridgesnky.org/uploads/2016_Experience-Dependent_Neuroplasticity.pdf Principles of experience-dependent neural plasticity: implications for rehabilitation after brain damage]. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 51, S225-S239.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hackney carriage.jpg|thumb|London Taxicab]]Experience-dependent neuroplasticity suggests that the brain changes in response to what it experiences. [[London]] [[taxicab]] drivers provide a great example of this dynamic. They undergo extensive training for 2–4 years, learning and memorizing street names, layout of streets within the city and the quickest cross-city routes.  After studying London taxicab drivers over a period of time, it was found that the [[grey matter]] volume increased over time in the posterior [[hippocampus]], an area in the brain involved heavily in memory. The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.  This suggests a correlation between a healthy person's mental training or exercise and their brains capacity to manage greater volume and more complex information. It should be noted, however, that the increase in volume actually led to a ''decrease'' in the taxi drivers' ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information.&lt;ref name="Maguire"&gt;Maguire, EA., Woollett, K., &amp; Spiers, HJ.

===Stress===
Research has found that chronic and acute stress have adverse effects on memory processing systems. Therefore, it is important to find mechanisms in which one can reduce the amount of stress in their lives when seeking to improve memory.

* '''[[Chronic stress]]''' has been shown to have negative impacts on the brain, especially in [[Memory#Processes|memory processing]] systems.&lt;ref name="Mizoguchi"&gt;Mizoguchi, K., Mitsutoshi, Y., Ishige, A., et al.

Elevated cortisol levels have been associated with poor performance on memory tasks (Newcomer et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2000) and reduced hippocampal volume (Lupien et al., 1998). Thus, stress may have induced the anterior hippocampal volume reduction in the taxi drivers."&lt;ref name="Maguire"/&gt;|group="nb"}}

Med. 238, 171−179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The human brain has a limited [[short-term memory]] capacity to process information, which results in constant competition between stimuli to become processed. [[Executive functions|Cognitive control]] processes such as selective attention reduce this competition by prioritizing where attentional resources are distributed.  Attention is crucial in memory processing and enhances encoding and strength of memory traces.&lt;ref name="Shiffrin"&gt;Shiffrin, R.M. (1976). Capacity limitations in information processing, attention, and memory. In W.K. Estes (Ed.), Handbook of learning and cognitive processes (Vol. 4). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to selectively attend to relevant information and ignore irrelevant information in order to have the greatest success at remembering.&lt;ref name="Slagter"&gt;Slagter, H.A., Lutz, A., Greischar, L.L., Francis, A.D., Nieuwenhuis, S., Davis, J.M., Davidson, R.J.

:Animal and human studies provide evidence as they report that acute stress impairs the maintenance of [[short-term memory]] and [[working memory]] and aggravates [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorders involved in short-term and working memory such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Mizoguchi"/&gt; Animal studies with rats have also shown that exposure to acute stress reduces the survival of hippocampal neurons.&lt;ref name="Tang"&gt;Tang, Y.Y., Ma, Y.

:One of the roles of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) is to help adapt to stressful environments.&lt;ref name="Mizoguchi"/&gt; It has been suggested that acute stress may have a protective function for individuals more vulnerable to their own stress hormones.

==Strategies==

===Cognitive training===
Discovering that the brain can change as a result of experience has resulted in the development of [[Brain fitness|cognitive training]]. Cognitive training improves cognitive functioning, which can increase [[working memory]] capacity and improve [[Cognition|cognitive skills]] and functions in clinical populations with [[working memory]] deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Morrison, AB., &amp; Chein, JM. (2010). [http://www.highiqpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morrison_Chein2011.pdf Does working memory training work? the promise and challenges of enhancing cognition by training working memory]. Psychonomic Society, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cognitive training may focus on [[attention]], [[Mental chronometry|speed of processing]], [[neurofeedback]], [[Dual-task paradigm|dual-tasking]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] training.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

Cognitive training has been shown to improve cognitive abilities for up to five years. In one experiment, the goal was to prove that cognitive training would increase the cognitive functions in older adults by using three types of training (memory, reasoning and speed of processing). It was found that improvements in cognitive ability not only was maintained over time but had a positive transfer effect on everyday functioning. Therefore, these results indicate that each type of cognitive training can produce immediate and lasting improvements in each kind of cognitive ability, thus suggesting that training can be beneficial to improving memory.&lt;ref name="Willis"&gt;Willis, SL., Tennstedt, SL., Marsiske, M., Ball, K., Elias, J., Koepke, KM., Morris, JN., Rebok, GW., Unverzagt, FW., Stoddard, AM., &amp; Wright, E. (2006). [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/204643 Long-term effects of cognitive training on everyday functional outcomes in older adults]. National Institutes of Health, 296(23), 2805-2814.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive training in areas other than memory has actually been seen to generalize and transfer to memory systems. For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4169294/ A Cognitive Training Program Based on Principles of Brain Plasticity: Results from the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) Study].  The American Geriatrics Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]
Two cognitive training methods are:

* '''Strategy training''' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;
* '''Core training''' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

The manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;

The Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated. The system was created by Dr Peter Marshall for research purposes at Royal Holloway, University of London. The system involves 5 groups of 5 tactics designed to maximise storage and recall at each stage of the process of registering, short-term storage, long-term storage, consolidation and retrieval and was designed to test efficacy of including memory training in school curricula.  Each section is of equal text length so that it can be taught verbatim in the same amount of time by all competent teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall,P(2012) Improving Your Memory: The Unique 5 x 5 System, Bexley-on-Sea: Oakley Books {{ISBN|978-0-9569784-6-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychopharmacology===
[[Psychopharmacology]] is the scientific study of the actions of drugs and their effects on [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[Sense|sensation]], [[thought]], and [[behavior]].

Evidence that aspects of memory can be improved by action on selective neurotransmitter systems, such as the [[cholinergic|cholinergic system]] which releases acetylcholine, has possible therapeutic benefits for patients with cognitive disorders.&lt;ref name="Robbins2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robbins|first1=T. W.|title=NEUROSCIENCE: Boosting Working Memory|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5500|year=2000|pages=2275–2276|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.290.5500.2275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from studies have indicated that acute administration of [[nicotine]] can improve cognitive performance (particularly tasks that require attention), short-term [[episodic memory]] and [[prospective memory]] task performance.  Chronic usage of low-dose nicotine in animals has been found to increase the number of [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] (nAChRs) and improve performance on learning and memory tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heishman | first1 = S.

A. | last3 = Singleton | first3 = E. G. | pmid=20414766 | pmc=3151730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term nicotine treatment, utilising nicotine skin patches, have shown that it may be possible to improve cognitive performance in a variety of groups such as normal non-smoking adults, Alzheimer's disease patients, [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenics]], and adults with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Swan, G. E., &amp; Lessov-Schlaggar, C. N. (2007). The effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine on cognition and the brain. Neuropsychol Rev, 17:259–273.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, evidence suggests that smoking improves visuospatial working memory impairments in schizophrenic patients, possible explaining the high rate of tobacco smoking found in people with schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, K. A., Termine, A., Seyal, A., Dudas, M. M., Vessicchio, J. C., Krishnan-Sarin, S., Jatlow, P. I., Bruce E. Wexler, B. E., &amp; George, T. P. (2005).

===Diet===
[[File:Milch-Jogurt-Früchte.jpg|thumb|Healthy fruits and vegetables]]

There is some evidence glucose consumption may have a positive impact on memory performance, though not in young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Korol DL |title=Enhancing cognitive function across the life span |journal=Ann.

===Stress management===
[[File:Trataka.JPG|thumb|150px|Meditation:attending to a flame]]
[[Meditation]], a form of mental training to focus attention,&lt;ref name="Slagter"/&gt; has been shown to increase the control over brain resource distribution, improving both [[attention]] and [[self control|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt; The changes are potentially long-lasting as meditation may have the ability to strengthen neuronal circuits as selective attentional processes improve.&lt;ref name="Xiong"&gt;Xiong, G.L. and Doraiswamy, M. (2009).  [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5317066/2009-xiong.pdf "Does Meditation Enhance Cognition and Brain Plasticity?"] ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. Vol 1172, pages 63-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meditation may also enhance [[LC4MP|cognitive limited capacity]], affecting the way in which stimuli are processed.&lt;ref name="Slagter"/&gt;

Meditation practice has also been associated with physical changes in brain structure. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of Buddhist insight meditation practitioners who practiced [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] meditation were found to have an increase in cortical thickness  and hippocampus volume compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;Luders, E., Toga, A.W., Lepore, N., Gaser, C.

===Exercise===
{{main|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Long-term effects}}
In both human and animal studies, [[Physical exercise|exercise]] has been shown to improve cognitive performance on encoding and retrieval tasks. [[Morris water navigation task|Morris water maze]] and radial arm water maze studies of [[rodent]]s found that, when compared to [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] animals, exercised mice showed improved performance traversing the water maze and displayed enhanced memory for the location of an escape platform.&lt;ref name="Berchtold"&gt;Berchtold, N.

''Med. Sci. Sports Exerc.'' 37, 1967–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise has been found to positively regulate [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] [[neurogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;van Praag H, Kempermann G, Gage FH. 1999b. [http://www.rg-40.com/Running_Increases.htm Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus]. Nat Neurosci 2:266–270.&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered an explanation for the positive influence of physical activities on memory performance. Hippocampus-dependent learning, for example, can promote the survival of newborn neurons which may serve as a foundation for the formation of new memories.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Borght, K., Havekes, R., Bos, T., Eggen, B. J., &amp; Van der Zee, E. A. (2007). [https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/3623253/2007BehavNeuroscivdBorght.pdf Exercise Improves Memory Acquisition and Retrieval in the Y-Maze Task: Relationship With Hippocampal Neurogenesis]. ''Behavioral Neuroscience'', 121 (2), 324–334.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exercise has been found to increase the level of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) protein in rats, with elevated BDNF levels corresponding with strengthened performance on memory tasks. Data also suggests that BDNF availability at the beginning of [[cognitive test]]ing is related to the overall acquisition of a new cognitive task and may be important in determining the strength of recall in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Berchtold"/&gt;

===Mental exercise===
[[Aristotle]] wrote a [[treatise]] about memory: ''[[On memory|De memoria et reminiscentia]]''.  To improve recollection, he advised that a systematic search should be made and that practice was helpful.  He suggested grouping the items to be remembered in threes and then concentrating upon the central member of each triad (group of three).&lt;ref name=Anne&gt;{{citation |title=Memory |author=Anne Whitehead |chapter=Memory and Inscription |pages=15–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music playing has recently gained attention as a possible way to promote brain plasticity. Promising results have been found suggesting that learning music can improve various aspects of memory. For instance, children who participated in one year of instrumental musical training showed improved verbal memory, whereas no such improvement was shown in children who discontinued musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, C. Y., &amp; Schlaug, G. (2010). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/?c=029 Music making as a tool for promoting brain plasticity across the life span]. The Neuroscientist, 16(5), 566– 577.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adults with no previous musical training who participated in individualized piano instruction showed significantly improved performance on tasks designed to test attention and working memory compared to a healthy control group.&lt;ref&gt;Bugos, J.

The '''Microtraining''' method is an approach aimed at supporting [[informal learning]] processes in organizations and companies. Learning in this sense means that an active process of knowledge creation is taking place within [[social interaction]]s, but outside of [[formal learning]] environments or training facilities. This process can be facilitated by well-designed and structured systems and by supporting ways of communication and collaboration, like the Microtraining method does. A Microtraining arrangement comprises a time span of 15–20 minutes for each learning session, which can activate and maintain learning processes for a longer period if bundled into series. A Microtraining session can be held face-to-face, online or embedded in an [[e-learning]] scenario.

==Applicability==
The Microtraining method can be applied to learning situations within [[organization]]s and [[Company|companies]], especially when basic knowledge needs to be refreshed or improved and when information is needed for immediate use in daily practice. In comparison to formal learning, Microtraining is an approach aimed at structuring informal learning activities. While formal learning may be a successful approach for people with less knowledge and skills [Tynjälä, 2008], it can be counter-productive for more experienced employees [Jonassen et al., 1993] for whom informal blended learning approaches like Microtraining appear to be working very well [Jonassen/Mayes/McAleese, 1993; Jonassen, 1997].

==Organizational requirements==
With regard to organizational requirements, facilitating the new learning concept by [[management]] and accompanying the initial phase of implementing the Microtraining method are crucial for its success. Consequently, the Microtraining method is not meant to be an approach to designing learning materials alone, but involves analyzing learning processes in organizations and supporting change management of learning strategies as a whole. If, for example, employees have insufficient access to a computer or web services supporting [[E-learning|online learning]] activities that are part of the Microtraining approach or if they are not allowed to spend working time learning, any effort to design the best material and collaborative surroundings will fail.

==Didactical principles==
The Microtraining method is based on several current learning theories and concepts, one of the most important of which is the theory of [[Social constructivism|Social Constructivism]], which sees learning as an active process, taking into account the learner's individual background [Vygotsky, 1978]. The second crucial idea comes from the concept of [[connectivism]], which states that learning is not an internal, solitary process, but that new knowledge is acquired best while working and learning in a lively community [Siemens, 2005].

==The method==
Microtraining sessions are structured as follows:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Microtraining session structure.png]] --&gt;

1 Active start (3 minutes)
* Start with a mental activity e.g. thinking, reflecting, organizing and comparing
* Communicate the goal of the session

'''''Monarch''''' is a British [[costume drama]] involving [[Henry VIII]]. It was written and directed by [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]] and released in 2000 at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]]. It was re-released in 2014 after the film negative, thought lost, was rediscovered.

==Plot==
''Monarch'' is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant.

In an ''Irish Post'' interview, Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balasundaram |first1=Nemesha |title=Rare TP McKenna film to be screened after original tapes recovered |url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost-32166#comment-364005 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Irish Post |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==
[[T. P. McKenna]] plays Henry VIII, while [[Jean Marsh]] plays an amalgamation of his ex-wives. [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]] played a courtier to King Henry. [[James Coombes (actor)|James Coombes]] (known for his [[James Bond]] style role in the [[Cadbury]] chocolate [[Milk Tray]] advertisements popular on UK television)&lt;ref name="MilkTray"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milk Tray Man is back, and all because the lady loves it |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11920070/Milk-Tray-Man-is-back-and-all-because-the-lady-loves....html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; played the King's personal protection guard.

==Production==
It was shot on [[35 mm film|35mm]] [[Kodak]] 5287 stock using [[Arriflex]] cameras. Principal photography commenced in October 1996 at [[Charlton House]] in south London, making it the only film about Henry VIII entirely shot in the borough where he was born: [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bishop |first1=Rachel |title="Tudor Whodunnit" filmed in Greenwich brought back to life |url=https://archive.fo/20141117163213/http://www.wharf.co.uk/2014/06/tudor-whodunnit-filmed-in-gree.html#selection-127.0-127.58 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Wharf (archived copy) |date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monarch back at Charlton House – film re-mastered for DVD and iTunes |url=https://www.weekender.co.uk/articles/uncategorised/monarch-back-charlton-house-film-re-mastered-dvd-itunes/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Weekender |date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] building served as the main location, with filming taking place inside and outside the house. The gardens were the backdrop for the opening title sequence. The Grand Salon and the Long Gallery featured heavily for the film’s dramatic scenes with Henry VIII. The house's clock tower was also utilised as the hiding place for Will, the ground-keeper's son, who hid from men who break into the house. Although set at night much of the filming took place during the day; black drapes were hung outside of the building to create a night effect.

In an interview with newspaper ''The Greenwich Visitor'' (page 5), Walsh discussed how he wanted his depiction of Henry VIII to be more grounded and less like those portrayals from Hollywood. He also discussed the difficulty of filming on a location and how the film benefited from using 35mm Kodak film stock.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/greenwichvisitor/docs/gv42.whole&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-release==
In 2014 a remastered version of ''Monarch'' was released following discovery of the original film negative, previously thought lost.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Steven |title=Lost joys: Directors reveal searches for missing movies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26420152 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt; The remastered version premiered on 14 September 2014 at London's [[Tricycle Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Palmer-29Aug2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Jim |title=Critically acclaimed movie Monarch shot in Charlton by Greenwich-based John Walsh set for high definition re-release |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11441818.display/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=News Shopper |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"/&gt; Walsh discussed the issues around finding the lost negatives for ''Monarch'' and other lost projects with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Janice Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Walsh - Spoken word session (18 April 2014) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01xn3p1 |website=BBC Radio 2 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Restoration was completed at Premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422225752/http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scanning and restoration team worked closely with director John Walsh, re-mastering from the original 35mm colour camera negative after it was discovered in a vault almost 20 years after it was originally filmed. In an interview about the project for the [[BBC]], John Walsh explained:

:"When we located the project we found more than we bargained for with over 52 cans of various footage from film trims, cutting copies and work prints. We didn't know if the original camera negative would be amongst all of this haul. After a close examination we were delighted to find all of the original camera negative was there and in good shape for its age."&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

Every frame of film was scanned in high definition at Premier and had more than 10,000 particles removed by hand by the restoration team. A new sound mix was also created from the original elements in Premier’s in-house audio department. In an article with ''The Weekender'' in November 2017 John discussed the importance restoration and preservation of older films to future-protect film such as ''Monarch'':

: "It will give today’s audiences the chance to see the wonderful performance of [[Jean Marsh]] and the towering presence of [[T. P. McKenna]], regarded as one of the great of his generation and rightly so in one of his most outstanding performances. ...
:Some films are lost for all time. From [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films to TV episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and [[Tony Hancock]]. The Holy Grail of lost films for collectors is [[London After Midnight (film)|''London After Midnight'']]. The 1927 silent horror- mystery film starring [[Lon Chaney]] and produced by [[MGM]] has not been seen for almost 50 years.”&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The film received strong reviews on its re-release in 2014 which were in contrast with the poor reviews in 2000. In 2000 Dennis Harvey wrote in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] that "''Monarch'' plays out an OK premise to results at once turgid and ridiculous." and describes McKenna's performance as "hammy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/monarch-1200464656/|title=Monarch|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=2000-10-23|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the ''[[Radio Times]]'' film critic Jeremy Aspinall called it "a fascinating, haunting little gem, with a richly nuanced performance from McKenna".&lt;ref name="Aspinall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aspinall |first1=Jeremy |title=Monarch |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/cvvst7/monarch/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film's realistic approach was noted by the [[BBFC]] who certified it a 15 on the basis that it "contains strong bloody violence".&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Monarch |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/monarch-video |website=BBFC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Monarch'' was released for the first time on [[DVD]] on 7 April 2014 by [[FremantleMedia]]. It included extras on the making of the film and the restoration process. A high definition version is also available to view on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/monarch-2000/id849697291&lt;/ref&gt;

''DVD Compare'' said "The film features an extraordinary British cast, is well written, and is perfectly paced."&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Samuel |title=Monarch |url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3294 |website=DVD Compare |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movie Waffler'' gave the film four stars for the main feature and four stars for the DVD extras, saying “McKenna is the beating heart of ''Monarch'', part wounded bear, part Augustus Gloop petulance.” It adds “This menacingly pessimistic view of British history and government is an immensely entertaining gothic melodrama, the creepy details that Walsh weaves into the film.”&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poole |first1=Benjamin |title=Monarch |url=http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2017/11/dvd-review-monarch-2000.html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Movie Waffler |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nuclear physics}}

'''Nuclear physics''' is the field of [[physics]] that studies [[atomic nuclei]] and their constituents and interactions. Other forms of [[nuclear matter]] are also studied.&lt;ref name=nupecc_report&gt;{{cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nuclear physics should not be confused with [[atomic physics]], which studies the [[atom]] as a whole, including its [[electron]]s.

Discoveries in nuclear physics have led to [[nuclear technology|applications]] in many fields. This includes [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], industrial and agricultural isotopes, [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]]. Such applications are studied in the field of [[nuclear engineering]].

[[Particle physics]] evolved out of nuclear physics and the two fields are typically taught in close association. [[Nuclear astrophysics]], the application of nuclear physics to [[astrophysics]], is crucial in explaining the inner workings of [[stars]] and the [[nucleosynthesis|origin of the chemical elements]].

==History==
[[File:Portrait of Antoine-Henri Becquerel.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Becquerel]]]]
[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|Since 1920s [[cloud chamber]]s played an important role of particle detectors and eventually lead to the discovery of [[positron]], [[muon]] and [[kaon]].]]

The history of nuclear physics as a discipline distinct from [[atomic physics]] starts with the discovery of [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896,&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite book

At the beginning of the 20th century the accepted model of the atom was J. J. Thomson's [[Plum pudding model|"plum pudding" model]] in which the atom was a positively charged ball with smaller negatively charged electrons embedded inside it.

In the years that followed, radioactivity was extensively investigated, notably by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as well as by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and his collaborators. By the turn of the century physicists had also discovered three types of [[radiation]] emanating from atoms, which they named [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]], and [[gamma decay|gamma]] radiation. Experiments by [[Otto Hahn]] in 1911 and by [[James Chadwick]] in 1914 discovered that the beta decay [[spectrum]] was continuous rather than discrete. That is, electrons were ejected from the atom with a continuous range of energies, rather than the discrete amounts of energy that were observed in gamma and alpha decays. This was a problem for nuclear physics at the time, because it seemed to indicate that [[conservation of energy|energy was not conserved]] in these decays.

The 1903 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics was awarded jointly to Becquerel for his discovery and to Marie and Pierre Curie for their subsequent research into radioactivity. Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his "investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances".

In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] formulated the idea of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. While the work on radioactivity by Becquerel and Marie Curie predates this, an explanation of the source of the energy of radioactivity would have to wait for the discovery that the nucleus itself was composed of smaller constituents, the [[nucleon]]s.

In 1906 [[Ernest Rutherford]] published "Retardation of the α Particle from Radium in passing through matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Rutherford|title=On the retardation of the α particle from radium in passing through matter|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|year=1906|volume=12|number=68|pages=134–146|doi=10.1080/14786440609463525}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Geiger]] expanded on this work in a communication to the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=On the scattering of α-particles by matter|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1908|volume=81|number=546|pages=174–177|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/81/546/174|doi=10.1098/rspa.1908.0067 |bibcode=1908RSPSA..81..174G}}&lt;/ref&gt; with experiments he and Rutherford had done, passing alpha particles through air, aluminum foil and gold leaf. More work was published in 1909 by Geiger and [[Ernest Marsden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Geiger | first1 =Hans| author-link1=Hans Geiger|last2=Marsden|first2=Ernest|author-link2=Ernest Marsden| title=On the diffuse reflection of the α-particles | year =1909 | volume=82| pages =495|number=557|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/82/557/495 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode=1909RSPSA..82..495G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further greatly expanded work was published in 1910 by Geiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=The scattering of the α-particles by matter|year=1910|volume=83|number=565|pages=492–504|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/83/565/492|doi=10.1098/rspa.1910.0038|bibcode=1910RSPSA..83..492G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911–1912 Rutherford went before the Royal Society to explain the experiments and propound the new theory of the atomic nucleus as we now understand it.

The key experiment behind this announcement was performed in 1910 at the [[University of Manchester]]: Ernest Rutherford's team performed a remarkable [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|experiment]] in which Geiger and Marsden under Rutherford's supervision fired alpha particles ([[helium]] nuclei) at a thin film of [[gold]] foil. The [[plum pudding model]] had predicted that the alpha particles should come out of the foil with their trajectories being at most slightly bent. But Rutherford instructed his team to look for something that shocked him to observe: a few particles were scattered through large angles, even completely backwards in some cases. He likened it to firing a bullet at tissue paper and having it bounce off. The discovery, with Rutherford's analysis of the data in 1911, led to the Rutherford model of the atom, in which the atom had a very small, very dense nucleus containing most of its mass, and consisting of heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons in order to balance out the charge (since the neutron was unknown). As an example, in this model (which is not the modern one) nitrogen-14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons (21 total particles) and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons.

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddington |first=A. S. |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=1920 |pages=297–303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.

The Rutherford model worked quite well until studies of [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] were carried out by [[Franco Rasetti]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1929. By 1925 it was known that protons and electrons each had a spin of {{frac|+/-1|2}}. In the Rutherford model of nitrogen-14, 20 of the total 21 nuclear particles should have paired up to cancel each other's spin, and the final odd particle should have left the nucleus with a net spin of {{frac|1|2}}. Rasetti discovered, however, that nitrogen-14 had a spin of 1.

=== James Chadwick discovers the neutron ===
{{Main|Discovery of the neutron}}
In 1932 Chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed by [[Walther Bothe]], [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]], [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] was actually due to a neutral particle of about the same mass as the proton, that he called the [[neutron]] (following a suggestion from Rutherford about the need for such a particle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=James|author-link1=James Chadwick|title=The existence of a neutron|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1932|volume=136|number=830|pages=692–708| url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/136/830/692|doi=10.1098/rspa.1932.0112 |bibcode=1932RSPSA.136..692C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[Dmitri Ivanenko]] suggested that there were no electrons in the nucleus — only protons and neutrons — and that neutrons were spin {{frac|1|2}} particles which explained the mass not due to protons. The neutron spin immediately solved the problem of the spin of nitrogen-14, as the one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron in this model each contributed a spin of {{frac|1|2}} in the same direction, giving a final total spin of 1.

With the discovery of the neutron, scientists could at last calculate what fraction of [[binding energy]] each nucleus had, by comparing the nuclear mass with that of the protons and neutrons which composed it. Differences between nuclear masses were calculated in this way. When nuclear reactions were measured, these were found to agree with Einstein's calculation of the equivalence of mass and energy to within 1% as of 1934.

=== Proca's equations of the massive vector boson field ===
[[Alexandru Proca]] was the first to develop and report the massive vector [[boson]] [[field equation]]s and a theory of the [[meson]]ic field of [[nuclear force]]s. Proca's equations were known to [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli'', Nobel lecture'', December 13, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; who mentioned the equations in his Nobel address, and they were also known to Yukawa, Wentzel, Taketani, Sakata, Kemmer, Heitler, and Fröhlich who appreciated the content of Proca's equations for developing a theory of the atomic nuclei in Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/epn:2006504  |title=Alexandru Proca (1897–1955) and his equation of the massive vector boson field |first=Dorin N. |last=Poenaru |first2=Alexandru |last2=Calboreanu |journal=[[Europhysics News]]|via=http://www.europhysicsnews.org  |volume=37|issue=5|pages=25–27 |bibcode = 2006ENews..37...24P |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''G.

===Yukawa's meson postulated to bind nuclei===
In 1935 [[Hideki Yukawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11429/ppmsj1919.17.0_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the first significant theory of the [[strong force]] to explain how the nucleus holds together. In the [[Yukawa interaction]] a [[virtual particle]], later called a [[meson]], mediated a force between all nucleons, including protons and neutrons. This force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion, and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive [[strong force]] had a more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between protons. Later, the discovery of the [[pi meson]] showed it to have the properties of Yukawa's particle.

With Yukawa's papers, the modern model of the atom was complete. The center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons, which is held together by the strong nuclear force, unless it is too large. Unstable nuclei may undergo alpha decay, in which they emit an energetic helium nucleus, or beta decay, in which they eject an electron (or [[positron]]). After one of these decays the resultant nucleus may be left in an excited state, and in this case it decays to its ground state by emitting high energy photons (gamma decay).

The study of the strong and weak nuclear forces (the latter explained by [[Enrico Fermi]] via [[Fermi's interaction]] in 1934) led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energies. This research became the science of [[particle physics]], the crown jewel of which is the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]] which describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.

==Modern nuclear physics==
{{Main|Liquid-drop model|Nuclear shell model|Nuclear structure}}
A heavy nucleus can contain hundreds of [[nucleon]]s. This means that with some approximation it can be treated as a [[Newtonian mechanics|classical system]], rather than a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] one. In the resulting [[liquid-drop model]],&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Blatt and V.F.Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Springer, 1979, VII.5&lt;/ref&gt; the nucleus has an energy which arises partly from [[surface tension]] and partly from electrical repulsion of the protons. The liquid-drop model is able to reproduce many features of nuclei, including the general trend of [[binding energy]] with respect to mass number, as well as the phenomenon of [[nuclear fission]].

Superimposed on this classical picture, however, are quantum-mechanical effects, which can be described using the [[nuclear shell model]], developed in large part by [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1969|title = On Closed Shells in Nuclei. II|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 12|pages = 1969–1970|year = 1949|last1 = Mayer|first1 = Maria Goeppert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Hans D. Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1766.2|title = On the "Magic Numbers" in Nuclear Structure|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 11|pages = 1766|year = 1949|last1 = Haxel|first1 = Otto|last2 = Jensen|first2 = J. Hans D|last3 = Suess|first3 = Hans E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei with certain numbers of neutrons and protons (the [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, ...) are particularly stable, because their [[Nuclear shell model|shells]] are filled.

Other more complicated models for the nucleus have also been proposed, such as the [[interacting boson model]], in which pairs of neutrons and protons interact as [[boson]]s, analogously to [[Cooper pair]]s of electrons.

[[ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|Ab initio methods]] try to solve the nuclear many-body problem from the ground up, starting from the nucleons and their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7|issue=1|pages=932|date=2017|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01007-9|pmid=28428625|pmc=5430567|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..932B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of current research in nuclear physics relates to the study of nuclei under extreme conditions such as high [[spin (physics)|spin]] and excitation energy. Nuclei may also have extreme shapes (similar to that of [[Rugby ball]]s or even [[pear]]s) or extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. Experimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion or nucleon transfer reactions, employing ion beams from an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]]. Beams with even higher energies can be used to create nuclei at very high temperatures, and there are signs that these experiments have produced a [[phase transition]] from normal nuclear matter to a new state, the [[quark–gluon plasma]], in which the [[quark]]s mingle with one another, rather than being segregated in triplets as they are in neutrons and protons.

===Nuclear decay===
{{Main|Radioactivity|Valley of stability}}
Eighty elements have at least one [[stable isotope]] which is never observed to decay, amounting to a total of about 254 stable isotopes. However, thousands of [[isotope]]s have been characterized as unstable. These "radioisotopes" decay over time scales ranging from fractions of a second to trillions of years.  Plotted on a chart as a function of atomic and neutron numbers, the binding energy of the nuclides forms what is known as the [[valley of stability]].  Stable nuclides lie along the bottom of this energy valley, while increasingly unstable nuclides lie up the valley walls, that is, have weaker binding energy.

The most stable nuclei fall within certain ranges or balances of composition of neutrons and protons: too few or too many neutrons (in relation to the number of protons) will cause it to decay. For example, in [[beta decay]] a [[nitrogen]]-16 atom (7 protons, 9 neutrons) is converted to an [[oxygen]]-16 atom (8 protons, 8 neutrons)&lt;ref&gt;Not a typical example as it results in a "doubly magic" nucleus&lt;/ref&gt; within a few seconds of being created. In this decay a neutron in the nitrogen nucleus is converted by the [[weak interaction]] into a proton, an electron and an [[antineutrino]]. The element is transmuted to another element, with a different number of protons.

In [[alpha decay]] (which typically occurs in the heaviest nuclei) the radioactive element decays by emitting a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), giving another element, plus helium-4. In many cases this process continues through several steps of this kind, including other types of decays (usually beta decay) until a stable element is formed.

In [[gamma decay]], a nucleus decays from an excited state into a lower energy state, by emitting a [[gamma ray]]. The element is not changed to another element in the process (no [[nuclear transmutation]] is involved).

Other more exotic decays are possible (see the first main article). For example, in [[internal conversion]] decay, the energy from an excited nucleus may eject one of the inner orbital electrons from the atom, in a process which produces high speed electrons, but is not [[beta decay]], and (unlike beta decay) does not transmute one element to another.

===Nuclear fusion===
In [[nuclear fusion]], two low mass nuclei come into very close contact with each other, so that the strong force fuses them. It requires a large amount of energy for the strong or [[nuclear force]]s to overcome the electrical repulsion between the nuclei in order to fuse them; therefore nuclear fusion can only take place at very high temperatures or high pressures. When nuclei fuse, a very large amount of energy is released and the combined nucleus assumes a lower energy level. The binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up to [[nickel]]-62. [[Star]]s like the Sun are powered by the fusion of four protons into a helium nucleus, two [[positron]]s, and two [[neutrinos]]. The uncontrolled fusion of hydrogen into helium is known as thermonuclear runaway. A frontier in current research at various institutions, for example the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) and [[ITER]], is the development of an economically viable method of using energy from a controlled fusion reaction.
Nuclear fusion is the origin of the energy (including in the form of light and other electromagnetic radiation) produced by the core of all stars including our own Sun.

===Nuclear fission===
[[Nuclear fission]] is the reverse process to fusion. For nuclei heavier than nickel-62 the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass number. It is therefore possible for energy to be released if a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter ones.

The process of [[alpha decay]] is in essence a special type of spontaneous [[nuclear fission]]. It is a highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make up the alpha particle are especially tightly bound to each other, making production of this nucleus in fission particularly likely.

From certain of the heaviest nuclei whose fission produces free neutrons, and which also easily absorb neutrons to initiate fission, a self-igniting type of neutron-initiated fission can be obtained, in a [[chain reaction]]. Chain reactions were known in chemistry before physics, and in fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain reactions. The fission or [[Nuclear chain reaction|"nuclear" chain-reaction]], using fission-produced neutrons, is the source of energy for [[nuclear power]] plants and fission type nuclear bombs, such as those detonated in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan, at the end of [[World War II]]. Heavy nuclei such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] may also undergo [[spontaneous fission]], but they are much more likely to undergo decay by alpha decay.

For a neutron-initiated chain reaction to occur, there must be a [[critical mass]] of the relevant isotope present in a certain space under certain conditions. The conditions for the smallest critical mass require the conservation of the emitted neutrons and also their slowing or [[neutron moderator|moderation]] so that there is a greater [[Neutron cross section|cross-section]] or probability of them initiating another fission. In two regions of [[Oklo]], Gabon, Africa, [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]s were active over 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meshik |first=A. P. |authorlink= |date=November 2005 |title=The Workings of an Ancient Nuclear Reactor |journal=Scientific American |volume= 293|issue= 5|pages= 82–91|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=ancient-nuclear-reactor |accessdate=2014-01-04 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1105-82|bibcode=2005SciAm.293e..82M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of natural neutrino emission have demonstrated that around half of the heat emanating from the Earth's core results from radioactive decay. However, it is not known if any of this results from fission chain reactions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Production of "heavy" elements (atomic number greater than five) ===
{{main|nucleosynthesis}}
According to the theory, as the Universe cooled after the [[Big Bang]] it eventually became possible for common subatomic particles as we know them (neutrons, protons and electrons) to exist. The most common particles created in the Big Bang which are still easily observable to us today were protons and electrons (in equal numbers). The protons would eventually form hydrogen atoms. Almost all the neutrons created in the Big Bang were absorbed into [[helium-4]] in the first three minutes after the Big Bang, and this helium accounts for most of the helium in the universe today (see [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]).

Some relatively small quantities of elements beyond helium (lithium, beryllium, and perhaps some boron) were created in the Big Bang, as the protons and neutrons collided with each other, but all of the "heavier elements" (carbon, element number 6, and elements of greater [[atomic number]]) that we see today, were created inside stars during a series of fusion stages, such as the [[proton-proton chain]], the [[CNO cycle]] and the [[triple-alpha process]]. Progressively heavier elements are created during the [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of a star.

Since the binding energy per [[nucleon]] peaks around iron (56 nucleons), energy is only released in fusion processes involving smaller atoms than that. Since the creation of heavier nuclei by fusion requires energy, nature resorts to the process of neutron capture. Neutrons (due to their lack of charge) are readily absorbed by a nucleus. The heavy elements are created by either a ''slow'' neutron capture process (the so-called ''s'' process) or the ''rapid'', or ''r'' process. The ''s'' process occurs in thermally pulsing stars (called AGB, or asymptotic giant branch stars) and takes hundreds to thousands of years to reach the heaviest elements of lead and bismuth. The ''r'' process is thought to occur in [[supernova explosions]] which provide the necessary conditions of high temperature, high neutron flux and ejected matter. These stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very fast, involving very neutron-rich species which then beta-decay to heavier elements, especially at the so-called waiting points that correspond to more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells (magic numbers).

In [[observational astronomy]], an '''observation arc''' (or '''arc length''') is the time period between the first and most recent (last) observation, tracing the body's path. It is usually given in days or years. The term is mostly used in the discovery and tracking of [[asteroids]] and [[comets]].

The observation arc determines how accurately known the orbit of the object is.  A very short arc could describe objects in a wide variety of orbits, at many distances from Earth.  In some cases, there have been objects whose initial arc was insufficient to determine if the object was in orbit around the Earth, or orbiting out in the [[asteroid belt]]. With a 1-day observation arc, {{mpl|2004 PR|107}} was thought to be a trans-Neptunian [[dwarf planet]], but is now known to be a 1&amp;nbsp;km main-belt asteroid. With an observation arc of 3 days {{mpl|2004 BX|159}} was thought to be a [[Mars-crossing asteroid]] that could be a threat to Earth, but it is now known to be a main-belt asteroid.

An observation arc less than 30 days can make it difficult to recover an [[Inner Solar System]] object more than a year after the last observation, and may result in a [[lost minor planet]]. Due to their greater distance from the Sun and slow movement across the sky, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s with observation arcs less than several years often have poorly constrained orbits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/astrokiwi/status/981438339420250114 Astronomer Michele Bannister] (4 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Observational cosmology''' is the study of the structure, the evolution and the origin of the [[universe]] through [[observation]], using instruments such as [[telescope]]s and [[cosmic ray]] detectors.

==Early observations==
The science of [[physical cosmology]] as it is practiced today had its subject material defined in the years following the [[Shapley-Curtis debate]] when it was determined that the [[universe]] had a larger scale than the [[Milky Way galaxy]]. This was precipitated by observations that established the [[size of the universe|size]] and the dynamics of the cosmos that could be explained by [[Einstein]]'s [[General Theory of Relativity]]. In its infancy, cosmology was a speculative science based on a very limited number of observations and characterized by a dispute between [[steady state]] theorists and promoters of [[Big Bang]] cosmology. It was not until the 1990s and beyond that the astronomical observations would be able to eliminate competing theories and drive the science to the "Golden Age of Cosmology" which was heralded by [[David Schramm (astrophysicist)|David Schramm]] at a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] colloquium in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia of the National Academy of Sciences: Physical Cosmology; Irvine, California: March 27–28, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hubble's law and the cosmic distance ladder===
{{main|Hubble's law|cosmic distance ladder}}
[[File:Edwin-hubble.jpg|thumb|Astronomer Edwin Hubble]]
Distance measurements in astronomy have historically been and continue to be confounded by considerable measurement uncertainty. In particular, while [[stellar parallax]] can be used to measure the distance to nearby stars, the observational limits imposed by the difficulty in measuring the minuscule parallaxes associated with objects beyond our galaxy meant that astronomers had to look for alternative ways to measure cosmic distances. To this end, a [[standard candle]] measurement for [[Cepheid variable]]s was discovered by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] in 1908 which would provide [[Edwin Hubble]] with the rung on the [[cosmic distance ladder]] he would need to determine the distance to [[spiral nebula]]. Hubble used the 100-inch [[Hooker Telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] to identify individual [[star]]s in those [[galaxy|galaxies]], and determine the distance to the galaxies by isolating individual Cepheids. This firmly established the spiral nebula as being objects well outside the Milky Way galaxy. Determining the distance to "island universes", as they were dubbed in the popular media, established the scale of the universe and settled the Shapley-Curtis debate once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;"Island universe" is a reference to speculative ideas promoted by a variety of scholastic thinkers in the 18th and 19th centuries. The most famous early proponent of such ideas was philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] who published a number of treatises on astronomy in addition to his more famous philosophical works. See Kant, I., 1755. ''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'', Part I, J.F. Peterson, Königsberg and Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, by combining various measurements, including Hubble's distance measurements and [[Vesto Slipher]]'s determinations of [[redshift]]s for these objects, [[Georges Lemaître]] was the first to estimate a constant of proportionality between galaxies' distances and what was termed their "recessional velocities", finding a value of about 600&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.&lt;ref name="Lem27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubble_vdBergh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubble_Block" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleReich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleLivio11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LemvsHubbleLivioRiess2013" /&gt; He showed that this was theoretically expected in a universe model based on [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name="Lem27" /&gt; Two years later, Hubble showed that the relation between the distances and velocities was a positive correlation and had a slope of about 500&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.&lt;ref name="Hubble1929" /&gt; This correlation would come to be known as ''[[Hubble's law]]'' and would serve as the observational foundation for the [[metric expansion of space|expanding universe theories]] on which cosmology is still based. The publication of the observations by Slipher, Wirtz, Hubble and their colleagues and the acceptance by the theorists of their theoretical implications in light of Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]] is considered the beginning of the modern science of cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;This popular consideration is echoed in ''[[Time Magazine]]'s'' listing for Edwin Hubble in their [[Time 100]] list of most influential people of the 20th Century. [[Michael Lemonick]] recounts, "He discovered the cosmos, and in doing so founded the science of cosmology." [http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/hubble.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclide abundances===
{{main|cosmochemistry|astrochemistry}}
Determination of the [[Abundance of the chemical elements#Abundance of elements in the Universe|cosmic abundance of elements]] has a history dating back to early [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements of light from astronomical objects and the identification of [[emission line|emission]] and [[absorption line]]s which corresponded to particular electronic transitions in [[chemical element]]s identified on Earth. For example, the element [[Helium]] was first identified through its spectroscopic signature in the [[Sun]] before it was isolated as a gas on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements'', page 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989), s.v. "helium". Retrieved December 16, 2006, from Oxford English Dictionary Online. Also, from quotation there: Thomson, W. (1872). ''Rep. Brit. Assoc.'' xcix: "Frankland and Lockyer find the yellow prominences to give a very decided bright line not far from D, but hitherto not identified with any terrestrial flame. It seems to indicate a new substance, which they propose to call Helium."&lt;/ref&gt;

Computing relative abundances was achieved through corresponding spectroscopic observations to measurements of the elemental composition of [[meteorite]]s.

===Detection of the cosmic microwave background===
{{main|Discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation}}
[[File:Ilc 9yr moll4096.png|thumb|the CMB seen by WMAP]]
A [[cosmic microwave background]] was predicted in 1948 by [[George Gamow]] and [[Ralph Alpher]], and by Alpher and [[Robert Herman]] as due to the hot [[big bang]] model. Moreover, Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gamow | first1 = G. | year = 1948 | title = The Origin of Elements and the Separation of Galaxies| url = | journal = Physical Review | volume = 74| page=505 | doi=10.1103/physrev.74.505.2|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74..505G }}{{cite journal | last1 = Gamow | first1 = G. | title = The evolution of the universe | journal = Nature|volume= 162 |year=1948|page= 680 | doi=10.1038/162680a0|bibcode = 1948Natur.162..680G }} {{cite journal | first1= R.

Their prediction was rediscovered by [[Robert Dicke]] and [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] in the early 1960s with the first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astrophysicists [[A. G. Doroshkevich]] and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]], in the spring of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. A. Penzias|title=The origin of elements.|work=[[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel lecture]]|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/penzias-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[David Todd Wilkinson]] and Peter Roll, Dicke's colleagues at [[Princeton University]], began constructing a Dicke radiometer to measure the cosmic microwave background.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Dicke, "The measurement of thermal radiation at microwave frequencies", ''Rev. Sci. Instrum.'' '''17''', 268 (1946). This basic design for a radiometer has been used in most subsequent cosmic microwave background experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] at the [[Crawford Hill]] location of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in nearby [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]] had built a Dicke radiometer that they intended to use for radio astronomy and satellite communication experiments. Their instrument had an excess 3.5&amp;nbsp;K [[noise temperature|antenna temperature]] which they could not account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke famously quipped: "Boys, we've been scooped."&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Penzias and R. W. Wilson, "A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s," ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''142''' (1965), 419. R. H. Dicke, P. J. E. Peebles, P. G. Roll and D. T. Wilkinson, "Cosmic Black-Body Radiation," ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''142''' (1965), 414. The history is given in P. J. E. Peebles, ''Principles of physical cosmology'' (Princeton Univ. Pr., Princeton 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting between the Princeton and Crawford Hill groups determined that the antenna temperature was indeed due to the microwave background. Penzias and Wilson received the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their discovery.

==Modern observations==
Today, observational cosmology continues to test the predictions of theoretical cosmology and has led to the refinement of cosmological models. For example, the observational evidence for [[dark matter]] has heavily influenced theoretical modeling of [[structure formation|structure]] and [[galaxy formation]]. When trying to calibrate the Hubble diagram with accurate [[supernova]] [[standard candle]]s, observational evidence for [[dark energy]] was obtained in the late 1990s. These observations have been incorporated into a six-parameter framework known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] which explains the evolution of the universe in terms of its constituent material. This model has subsequently been verified by detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background, especially through the [[WMAP]] experiment.

Included here are the modern observational efforts that have directly influenced cosmology.

===Redshift surveys===
{{main|Redshift survey}}
With the advent of automated [[telescope]]s and improvements in [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopes]], a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in [[redshift]] space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the universe. The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast [[supercluster]] of galaxies over 500 million [[light-year]]s wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Geller &amp; J. P. Huchra, ''Science'' '''246''', 897 (1989). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/4932/897 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]], started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See the official CfA [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/zcat/ website] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring ''z''-values for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final [[data set]] was released 30 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09318.x|title=The 2dF galaxy redshift survey: Power-spectrum analysis of the final dataset and cosmological implications|author=Shaun Cole|author2=et al.

The [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey]] uses the [[Keck telescopes]] with the new "DEIMOS" [[spectrograph]]; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a complement to SDSS and 2dF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Science objectives and early results of the DEEP2 redshift survey|author=Marc Davis|author2=et al.

===Cosmic microwave background experiments===
{{main|Cosmic microwave background experiments}}
Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments had been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) satellite that orbited in 1989&amp;ndash;1996 and which detected and quantified the large-scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground-based and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of those experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution.  The measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic strings]] as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree.  Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the Universe is [[flat space|flat]].  A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI) and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, NASA launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the large-scale anisotropies over the full sky. The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum to below degree scales, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data center for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large angular-scale fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as large in the sky as the Moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed using previous ground-based interferometers.

A third space mission, [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], was launched in May 2009.  Planck employs both [[HEMT]] radiometers and [[bolometer]] technology and measures the CMB anisotropies at a higher resolution than WMAP.  Unlike the previous two space missions, Planck is a collaboration between NASA and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). Its detectors got a trial run at the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment &amp;ndash; which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date &amp;ndash; and at the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.

Additional ground-based instruments such as the [[South Pole Telescope]] in Antarctica and the proposed [[Clover (telescope)|Clover]] Project, [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] and the [[QUIET telescope]] in [[Chile]] will provide additional data not available from satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization.

===Telescope observations===

====Radio====
The brightest sources of low-frequency radio emission (10&amp;nbsp;MHz and 100&amp;nbsp;GHz) are [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]] which can be observed out to extremely high redshifts. These are subsets of the [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] that have extended features known as lobes and jets which extend away from the [[galactic nucleus]] distances on the order of [[megaparsec]]s. Because radio galaxies are so bright, astronomers have used them to probe extreme distances and early times in the evolution of the universe.

====Infrared====
Far [[infrared]] observations including [[submillimeter astronomy]] have revealed a number of sources at cosmological distances. With the exception of a few [[infrared window|atmospheric window]]s, most of infrared light is blocked by the atmosphere, the observations generally take place from balloon or space-based instruments. Current observational experiments in the infrared include [[NICMOS]], the [[Cosmic Origins Spectrograph]], the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], the [[Keck Interferometer]], the [[Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy]], and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. The next large space telescope planned by NASA, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] will also explore in the infrared.

An additional infrared survey, the [[Two-Micron All Sky Survey]], has also been very useful in revealing the distribution of galaxies, similar to other optical surveys described below.

====Optical rays (visible to human eyes)====
Optical light is still the primary means by which astronomy occurs, and in the context of cosmology, this means observing distant galaxies and galaxy clusters in order to learn about the [[Large-scale structure of the universe|large scale structure]] of the Universe as well as [[galaxy evolution]]. [[Redshift survey]]s have been a common means by which this has been accomplished with some of the most famous including the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]], the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], and the upcoming [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]]. These optical observations generally use either [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] or [[spectroscopy]] to measure the [[redshift]] of a galaxy and then, via [[Hubble's Law]], determine its distance modulo redshift distortions due to [[peculiar velocities]]. Additionally, the position of the galaxies as seen on the sky in [[celestial coordinates]] can be used to gain information about the other two spatial dimensions.

Very deep observations (which is to say sensitive to dim sources) are also useful tools in cosmology. The [[Hubble Deep Field]], [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]], [[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]], and [[Hubble Deep Field South]] are all examples of this.

===Cosmic ray observations===

==Future observations==

===Cosmic neutrinos===
{{main|Cosmic neutrino background}}
It is a prediction of the [[Big Bang]] model that the universe is filled with a [[Cosmic neutrino background|neutrino background radiation]], analogous to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. The microwave background is a relic from when the universe was about 380,000 years old, but the neutrino background is a relic from when the universe was about two seconds old.

If this neutrino radiation could be observed, it would be a window into very early stages of the universe. Unfortunately, these neutrinos would now be very cold, and so they are effectively impossible to observe directly.

The '''Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology''', ('''POST''') is the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s in-house source of independent, balanced and accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/ |title=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST (rather distinctively) serves BOTH Houses of Parliament (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and equally the [[House of Lords]]) as a joint establishment, through output that is apolitical and of widely acclaimed value to Parliamentarians of all parties. Thorough quality-control ensures that [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Peerage|Peers]] can have confidence in its analyses should they wish to cite them in debate. These principles are reflected in the structure of [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#The POST Board|POST’s Board]] with members from the Commons and Lords together with distinguished scientists and engineers from the wider world.

The UK Parliament made POST a permanent institution in 2001, after Dr Ian Gibson MP, POST's Chairman, Lord Flowers - vice-Chairman and Professor David Cope, Director, presented evidence to the then House of Commons Administration Committee to support the decision, which was endorsed later by the House of Lords.

Since 1939, a group of MPs and peers interested in science and technology, through the first parliamentary "All Party Group",   the UK Parliamentary and Scientific Committee&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceinparliament.org.uk/ |title=Parliamentary and Scientific Committee |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (P&amp;S), had encouraged UK Parliamentarians to explore the implications of scientific developments for society and public policy. As the UK economy became more dependent on technological progress, and the varied effects of technology (especially on the environment) became more apparent, it was felt that UK Parliament needed its own resources on such issues. Parliamentarians not only required access to knowledge and insights into the implications of technology for their constituents and society, but also needed to exercise their scrutiny functions over UK government legislation and administration. This thinking was also influenced by the fact that specialised parliamentary science and technology organisations already existed overseas.

P&amp;S members ([[Ian Lloyd (UK politician)|Sir Ian Lloyd MP]], [[Trevor Skeet|Sir Trevor Skeet MP]], [[Gerard Vaughan (British politician)|Sir Gerry Vaughan MP]], Lords [[Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet|Kennet]], Gregson and [[Brian Flowers, Baron Flowers|Flowers]] among others) visited already established organisations in the US, Germany and France, and this reinforced their view that modern Parliaments needed their own ‘intelligence’ on science and technology-related issues. Initially they asked the then [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] to fund such services at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but were asked first to demonstrate a real need. This led to the P&amp;S creating a charitable foundation to raise funds from P&amp;S members.

The parliamentary reaction was positive and led to the appointment of a first Director, Dr Michael Norton.  In 1989, POST was formally established as a charitable foundation, though not an internal part of Parliament.

POST had attracted more resources by 1992 and then recruited 3 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Permanent staff|specialist science advisers]] and began its [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Fellows|fellowship]] programme with the [[UK research councils]].

In 1992 the House of Commons Information Committee, supported by the House of Lords, recommended that Parliament should itself fund POST for 3 years, and a subsequent review in 1995 extended this for a further 5 years. This was the result of POST demonstrating real interest and demand from MPs and peers.

POST's financial reliance on donations from bodies external to Parliament, even those as prestigious as the Royal Society, had always slightly compromised the perceived independence of the office.

From 1997 the chair of the POST board was appointed by government Whips. Since then, chairs have been [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Dr Ian Gibson MP]] 1997-2001, [[Phyllis Starkey|Dr Phyllis Starkey MP]] 2001-2005, and [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Dr Ashok Kumar MP]] 2005-2010. Dr Kumar died shortly before the UK 2010 General Election.  Since then, subject to parliamentary approval, the Chair of POST has been Adam Afiyie, MP.

In 1998 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Professor David Cope]] took over as Director of POST. He guided the Office towards the goal of establishing POST as a permanent office of the UK Parliament - and dramatically expanded its staffing, wider links and more general recognition of its role as a special, distinctive, institution that the UK Parliament had agreed, enthusiastically, to endorse.

In 2001, both Houses decided that POST should indeed be established as a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution, funded exclusively by Parliament itself, through the two Houses, in a ratio of 70%/30%, Commons/Lords.

In 2009, POST celebrated its 20th anniversary with, among other events, a special conference, arranged by the Director, Prof Cope, on "Images of the Future".  The keynote participants were the Hon. Bart Gordon, Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology and Dr Jim Dator of the University of Hawaii Futures Research Centre, along with many other Members and staff of Parliaments across the world.

Because of the enthusiasm of Members of both Houses, POST had enjoyed a unique status within Parliament. It was from its inception attached administratively to the House of Commons COMMISSION (though always with its link to the House of Lords.)

This arrangement was intended specifically to distinguish the office and its functions from the Libraries of either House.  These conduct non peer-reviewed "studies", of varying quality.  POST - on the other hand - was expected to provide proactive analysis and options, freed from the immediate pressure of political or administrative expectations, trying to embrace futures thinking, and above all, to subject all its work to the most critical peer review analysis.

POST'S Director, Prof David Cope, returned to Cambridge University in 2012 and Dr. Chris Tyler was appointed by parliamentary authorities to a reduced role, which saw the fundamental rationale of POST as a "science and technology assessment" institution increasingly changed to one which more engaged with the ongoing debate on "science policy".

POST, from its foundation, had always been an institution "of", rather than "for" - science and technology -in other words - it did not in any way lobby for more public funds for scientific or technological research.  Dr Tyler, however, was closely involved with the "Campaign for Science and Engineering" - a UK body which does so lobby.  On appointment, he did not immediately resign his role in any lobbying body, and this continued seriously to undermine his perceived independence while head of POST.

Dr. Tyler left POST in 2017 for a secondary position at University College London.

The Acting Directorship of POST was taken over by a longstanding staff member, Dr Chandrika Nath, who was totally immune from any such lobbying role. In 2018, in a reconfirmed acknowledgement of POST's immutable science and technology assessment role, she was appointed Executive Director of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the highly prestigious intergovernmental organisation.

Dr. Grant Hill-Cawthorne (University of Sydney) became Head of POST from May 2018.  

==Activities==

===Science and Technology in Parliament===
Most parliamentarians do not have a scientific or technological background but science and technology issues are increasingly integral to public policy. Parliamentarians are bombarded daily with lobbying, public enquiries and media stories about science and technology. These cover diverse areas such as medical advances, environmental issues and global communications. POST helps parliamentarians examine such issues effectively by providing information resources, in depth analysis and impartial advice. POST works closely with a wide range of organisations involved in science and technology, including [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committees]], [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|all-party parliamentary groups]], [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], scientific societies, [[Think tank|policy think tanks]], business, academia and research funders.

===POST's aim===
POST's aim is to inform parliamentary debate through:
*Publishing POSTnotes (short briefing notes) and longer reports. POSTnotes can be downloaded from the publications section of the POST website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/publications/ POST Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Both focus on current science and technology issues and aim to anticipate policy implications for parliamentarians.
*Supporting select committees, with informal advice, oral briefings, data analyses, background papers or follow-up research. Committees may approach POST for such advice at any stage in an inquiry.
*Informing both Houses on public dialogue activities in science and technology.
*Organising discussions to stimulate debate on a wide range of topical issues, from small working groups to large lectures.&lt;ref name="Seminars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/ |title=POST Events |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Horizon-scanning to anticipate issues of science and technology that are likely to impact on policy

===How POST works===
A parliamentary board guides POST's choice of subjects. A team of advisers conduct analyses, drawing on a wide range of external expertise. All reports and POSTnotes are externally peer reviewed, and scrutinised by the board before publication.

POST's work falls into four topical areas:
*Biological Sciences and Health
*Physical Sciences and ICT
*Environment and Energy
*Social Sciences

===International activities===
POST is a member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] network, which brings together parliamentary organisations throughout Europe sharing information and working on joint projects.&lt;ref name="EPTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eptanetwork.org/|title=European Parliamentary Technology Assessment |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST also liaises with science and technology organisations across the world.

Between November 2005 to 2009, POST, collaborating with four of its sister organisations - at the [[Folketing|Danish]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish]] and [[Bundestag|German]] Parliaments - provided [[technology assessment]] services to the [[Science and Technology Options Assessment]] unit of the [[European Parliament]], in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]].

====POST Africa Programme====
From 2001 POST received a growing number of requests for advice from parliamentarians in developing countries. It became clear that a real need existed to strengthen capacity in developing country parliaments. In 2005, POST held discussions on this issue with the Gatsby Foundation,&lt;ref name="Gatsby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsby.org.uk/ |title=The Gatsby Charitable Foundation |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a special initiative to assist African Parliaments, and other organisations in their countries, in building parliamentary capacity to handle policy issues related to science and technology. At a time when there is growing awareness of the importance of science and technology in decision making, as demonstrated by, for example, the focus on science, technology and innovation at the [[African Union]] summit meeting in January 2007, this programme continues to contribute towards the overall objective of ensuring that parliaments have the capacity to scrutinise decision making processes and act as the national fora for discussion and debate on the broad implications of issues with a basis in science and technology. By sharing information and best practice with overseas parliaments and assemblies, the programme supports one of the primary objectives of the House: to promote public knowledge and understanding of the work and role of Parliament through the provision of information and access.

==The POST Board==
(Appointed 2010)

The POST Board oversees POST's objectives, outputs and future work programme. It meets quarterly. The Board comprises:
* 14 parliamentarians drawn from the House of Commons (10) and the House of Lords (4), roughly reflecting the balance of parties in Parliament.
* Leading non-parliamentarians from the science and technology community.
* Representatives of the House of Lords and the Department of Information Services of the House of Commons.

===Officers===
*Chairman: [[Adam Afriyie|Adam Afriyie MP]]
*Vice-Chairman: [[Robert Winston|Professor the Lord Winston]]
*Head: Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne

===House of Lords===
*Lord Oxburgh, KBE, PhD, FRS
*[[Simon Haskel, Baron Haskel|Lord Haskel]]
*Lord Patel, KT, FMedSci, FRSE

=== Externals ===
*Professor Frances R. Balkwill, OBE
*Professor Sarah Whatmore, FBA
*Paul Martynenko, FBCS
*Professor Sir Bernard Silverman, FRS, FAcSS

===''Ex Officio'' Board Members===
*Penny Young, [[The House of Commons Librarian]] and Managing Director Research &amp; Information, House of Commons
*Nicolas Besly, Clerk of Select Committees, House of Lords
*Edward Potton, Head of Science and Environment Section, House of Commons Library
*Lynn Gardner, Principal Clerk, Committee Office, House of Commons
*Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, Head of POST

==POST staff==

===Permanent staff===
POST has eight science advisers, covering the fields of biology and health; physical sciences and ICT; environment and energy; and social sciences. Science advisers generally have a postgraduate qualification and science policy experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9360">In social sciences, '''participation inequality''' consists of difference between levels of participation of various groups in certain activities. Common examples include:
* differing levels of participation in democratic, electoral politics, by social class, race, gender, etc.
* differing levels of participation in online communities as described by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html |title=Participation Inequality: Encouraging More Users to Contribute |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, participation inequality typically affects "the kinds of individuals, such as the young, the poor and those with little formal education"&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irpp.org/choices/archive/vol9no7.pdf|format=PDF|title=From Enumeration to the National Register of Electors: An Account and an Evaluation|last=Black|first=Jerome H.|journal=Choices|publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy|volume=9|number=7|issn=0711-0677|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tend to not take the initiative to participate in electoral and related events. State enumeration, such as was done in Canada before the implementation of the [[National Register of Electors]] in 1996, "worked to augment voter turnout among all segments of society and thus mitigated a natural tendency toward participation inequality in electoral politics".&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE" /&gt;

== Political Participation Inequality ==
'''Political participation inequality''' refers to how populations differ in political participation when sorted by various characteristics. Most often these groupings are by social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. Widespread political participation inequality often describes when various groups are left out of the political sphere or excluded from various political rights.

Participation inequality usually helps political theorists determine where democracies fail or when political institutions are not democratically responsive. When political systems are too unequal in terms of political participation, it most generally means that there is a breakdown in the ability of all citizens to politically deliberate to distribute various scarce resources, implement comprehensive public policy, or enact needed social reforms. Nations with high amounts of participation inequality are generally characterized as undemocratic although there are certain nations, like India, where low participation inequality has not helped the democratic responsiveness of Indian institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahuja, Chhibber|first=Amit, Pradeep|date=2012|title=Why the Poor Vote in India: "If I Don't Vote, I Am Dead to the State"|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Dahl ===
[[File:Robert_Dahl's_Two-Dimensions.png|thumb|Robert Dahl's two dimensions for evaluating democracies/polarchies]]
In his 1971 paper ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'', [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]] provided a basic framework to evaluate democracies or polyarchies (nearly/almost full democracies) based on their participation inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there are two dimensions: public contestation – the various rights and procedures guaranteed to citizens – and inclusiveness – how accessible these rights are to all citizens. More fully, public contestation describes the necessary functions for a liberal democracy: a competitive political atmosphere, ability to run for office, right to vote, right to assembly, etc. Inclusiveness describes what portion of the population is able to enjoy these rights and procedures.

Participation inequality is usually represented along the dimension of inclusiveness. So, if a nation were to allow only short people to vote, this political system would have a certain level of public contestation – the right to vote being available – and a certain dimension of inclusiveness – only short people being able to enjoy this right. This system of evaluating democracies enables comparisons of political regimes based on participation inequality by comparing inclusiveness between equally publicly contestable political systems.

=== Causes of Political Participation ===

==== Dahlian Causes ====
Using Dahl’s framework, the first cause of participation inequality can be rooted in a political system’s public policy or in the Dahlian dimension of inclusiveness. Policies that exclude groups based on ethnic identity such as old [[Apartheid South Africa|apartheid]] South Africa or Iranian exclusion of Sunni political parties best conveys systemic political exclusion that is rooted in a regime’s citizenship requirements or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2016/04/29/4452814.htm|title=Political Identity and the Problem of Democratic Exclusion|date=2016-04-29|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion of Dahl ====
[[File:Expansion_of_Dahl's_Theory.png|thumb|An expansion on Robert Dahl's two dimensions by adding a possible third dimension: institutions]]
The more insidious cause of participation inequality stems from a third dimension that has been recently added to Dahl’s two-dimensional evaluation of political systems: institutions. In this framework, '''institutions''' implement political rights and procedures guaranteed by the state. Institutional causes for participation inequality can include literacy tests, extensive citizenship requirements, sparse voting booths in rural or poor areas, and a lack of public transportation. These all affect the ability of citizens to properly exercise guaranteed rights like voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan, Espenshade|first=S. Karthick, Thomas J.|date=September 2001|title=Immigrant Incorporation and Political Participation in the United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2001.tb00044.x/full|journal=International Migration Review|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional causes of participation inequality can also be mitigated or exacerbated by cultural norms. Most often high voter turnout usually is hailed as a marker for a democratically responsive nation; however, in [[India]] “the turnout rate among the poor is almost as high as for those who are either middle class or rich. A detailed study of voter participation reported for the 2009 national elections shows that voter participation rates do not seem to vary by income status at all…Recent studies report similar findings from Africa and Latin America (Bratton 2008; Boot &amp; Seligson 2008)”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these studies conclude that in developing democracies voting acts as a reassurance of social status or worth in the eyes of the state. This cultural norm has not translated to more democratically responsive institutions in that “the governments created by these elections are known to neglect the interests of the poor and treat them disrespectfully compared to other income groups”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nations like India are considered to be exceptions to the general rule that economic status has some bearing on voter participation.

==== Economic and Educational Inequality ====
Economic inequality and educational inequality have often been pointed to as common culprits for political participation inequality. In large part, these two types of inequality are often created and reiterated by political institutions, but most political theorists differentiate these causes for political participation as separate, largely because they are not fully solved by changes in political institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solt|first=Frederick|date=2008|title=Economic Inequality and Democratic Political Engagement|jstor=25193796|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=52|issue=1|pages=48–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the outcomes of political institutions highly vary from regime to regime, most of the literature finds that high amounts of economic inequality in developed countries depress voter turnout for poorer individuals and increase voter turnout for more affluent individuals (this depends on social cohesion of societies, correlating negatively with affluent political participation when economic inequality is high).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other literature finds that educational inequality depresses voter turnout depending on one’s income level and perceived relative educational status (how one perceives one’s social status and others’ education levels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Mikael|date=March 2010|title=The Effects of Economic and Educational Inequality on Political Participation|url=https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/a47c0359-276e-4a48-9c16-c46bd345968d.pdf|journal=University of Gothenburg Department of Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pericycle''' is a cylinder of [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] or [[sclerenchyma]] cells that lies just inside the [[endodermis]] and is the outer most part of the [[stele (biology)|stele]] of plants.

Although it is composed of non-vascular parenchyma cells, it is still considered part of the vascular cylinder because it arises from the procambium as do the vascular tissues it surrounds.

In [[eudicots]], it also has the capacity to produce [[lateral roots]].  Branch roots arise from this primary [[meristem]] tissue. In plants undergoing [[secondary growth]], the pericycle contributes to the [[vascular cambium]] often diverging into a [[cork cambium]].

In [[angiosperms]] certain molecules within the [[endodermis]] and the surrounding vasculature are sent to the pericycle which promotes the growth of the root [[meristem]]s.

== Location ==

The pericycle is located between the endodermis and phloem in plant roots.  In dicot stems, it is situated around the ring of vascular bundles in the stele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.031 |pmid=24845660 |title=Pericycle |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=R378–9 |year=2014 |last1=Beeckman |first1=Tom |last2=De Smet |first2=Ive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

In dicot roots, the pericycle strengthens the roots and provides protection for the [[vascular bundle]]s.

In dicot root, the vascular cambium is completely secondary in origin, and it originates from a portion of pericycle tissue.

The pericycle regulates the formation of lateral roots by rapidly dividing near the xylem elements of the root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7588064 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7588064 |year=1995 |author1=Laskowski |first1=M. J. |title=Formation of lateral root meristems is a two-stage process |journal=Development |volume=121 |issue=10 |pages=3303–10 |last2=Williams |first2=M. E. |last3=Nusbaum |first3=H. C. |last4=Sussex |first4=I. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been known to often be confused with other parts of the plant. However, its unique ring structure allows it to be more easily identified.

Past efforts to isolate such tissue have been successful. Monocot roots rarely branch, but can, and this branch will originate from the pericycle.

'''Place-based education''', sometimes called '''pedagogy of place''', '''place-based learning''', '''[[experiential education]]''', '''community-based education''', '''[[education for sustainability]]''', '''[[environmental education]]''' or more rarely, '''[[service learning]]''', is an educational philosophy.  The term was [https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/elfer_charles_j_201108_phd.pdf coined in the early 1990s] by Laurie Lane-Zucker of The [[Orion Society]] and Dr. John Elder of Middlebury College. Orion's early work in the area of place-based education was funded by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1996/05/29/36grant.h15.html?tkn=WVMFMa8sjs6Lnl2YCsgfSoxYe6eRxGRfaTlz|title=Grants - Education Week|date=1996-05-29|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although educators have used its principles for some time, the approach was developed initially by The Orion Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |title=The Nature Literacy Series |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918062932/http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization, as well as Professor [[David Sobel]], Project Director at [[Antioch University New England]].

In his introduction to the first book specifically focused on the pedagogy, [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256984.Place_Based_Education Place-Based Education: Connecting Classrooms and Communities] ({{ISBN|978-0913098547}}), Lane-Zucker [http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/ describes the context within which place-based education was developed],

{{quote|In an increasingly globalized world, there are often pressures for communities and regions to subordinate themselves to the dominant economic models and to devalue their local cultural identity, traditions and history in preference to a flashily marketed homogeneity. Furthermore, at a time when industrial pollution, biodiversity/habitat loss, and aquifer depletion are becoming widespread and acute, such pressures often exacerbate the problems by encouraging unsustainable patterns of consumption and land use, and by weakening familial and community relationships that are deeply tied to the local environment. A process of disintegration occurs as basic connections to the land fray and communities become less resilient and less able to deal with the dislocations that globalization and ecological deterioration bring about. A community's health—human and more-than-human—suffers.

The path to a sustainable existence must start with a fundamental reimagining of the ethical, economic, political and spiritual foundations upon which society is based, and that this process needs to occur within the context of a deep local knowledge of place. The solutions to many of our ecological problems lie in an approach that celebrates, empowers and nurtures the cultural, artistic, historical and spiritual resources of each local community and region, and champions their ability to bring those resources to bear on the healing of nature and community.

Schools and other educational institutions can and should play a central role in this process, but for the most part they do not. Indeed, they have often contributed to the problem by educating young people to be, in David Orr's words, 'mobile, rootless and autistic toward their places.' A significant transformation of education might begin with the effort to learn how events and processes close to home relate to regional, national, and global forces and events, leading to a new understanding of ecological stewardship and community. This, I believe, supports the propagation of an enlightened localism—a local/global dialectic that is sensitive to broader ecological and social relationships at the same time as it strengthens and deepens peoples sense of community and land.

Place-based education might be characterized as the pedagogy of community, the reintegration of the individual into her homeground and the restoration of the essential links between a person and her place. Place-based education challenges the meaning of education by asking seemingly simple questions: Where am I? What is the nature of this place? What sustains this community? It often employs a process of re-storying, whereby students are asked to respond creatively to stories of their homeground so that, in time, they are able to position themselves, imaginatively and actually, within the continuum of nature and culture in that place. They become a part of the community, rather than a passive observer of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/|title=Place-based Education, Entrepreneurship and Investing for an "Impact Economy" {{!}} Your Mark On The World|date=2016-08-01|work=Your Mark On The World|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Place-based education seeks to help communities through employing students and school staff in solving community problems. Place-based education differs from conventional text and classroom-based education in that it understands students' local community as one of the primary resources for learning. Thus, place-based education promotes learning that is rooted in what is local—the unique history, environment, culture, economy, literature, and art of a particular place&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm Rural Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929161138/http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, in students' own "[[Location (geography)|place]]" or immediate schoolyard, neighborhood, town or community. According to this pedagogy, grade school students often lose what place-based educators call their "[[sense of place]]" through focusing too quickly or exclusively on national or global issues. This is not to say that international and domestic issues are peripheral to place-based education, but that students should first have a grounding in the history, culture and [[ecology]] of their surrounding environment before moving on to broader subjects.

Place-based education often involves [[hands-on learning]], [[project-based learning]], and is always related to something in the real world. Thus students embarking upon a unit about the [[Vietnam War]] might interview veterans of that war, collecting their stories for a radio-spot, newspaper article or educational brochure. In this case, the use of local people to support students' learning would not only lead to greater comprehension of the Vietnam War, but also to understanding more about the history of their community and the people in it.

Byron Fellowship is a place-based learning experience built around sustainable community development.

[[Wintergreen Studios]] is a year-round wilderness education and retreat centre in Southeastern Ontario offering workshops and meeting facilities. Wintergreen's environment and architecture have been designed to enable people to engage in mindful living and return to their homes and workplaces inspired and refreshed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9969">The '''planetary equilibrium temperature''' is a theoretical temperature that a [[planet]] would be at when considered simply as if it were a [[black body]] being heated only by its parent [[star]]. In this model, the presence or absence of an [[atmosphere]] (and therefore any [[greenhouse effect]]) is not considered, and one treats the theoretical black body temperature as if it came from an idealized surface of the planet.

Other authors use different names for this concept, such as '''equivalent blackbody temperature''' of a planet,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, J.M., Hobbs, P.V. (2006). ''Atmospheric Science. An Introductory Survey'', second edition, Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|978-0-12-732951-2}}. Section 4.3.3, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''effective radiation emission temperature''' of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Stull, R. (2000). ''Meteorology For Scientists and Engineers. A technical companion book with Ahrens' Meteorology Today'', Brooks/Cole, Belmont CA, {{ISBN|978-0-534-37214-9}}., p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts include the global mean temperature, global radiative equilibrium, and  global-mean surface air temperature,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, J.M., Hobbs, P.V. (2006). ''Atmospheric Science. An Introductory Survey'', second edition, Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|978-0-12-732951-2}}., p.444.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the [[effects of global warming]].

==Calculation of semi-blackbody temperature==

If the incident solar radiation ("[[insolation]]") on the planet at its orbital distance from the Sun is I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the amount of energy absorbed by the planet will depend on its [[albedo]] a and its cross-sectional area:

&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ in }={ I_o } \left( 1-a \right)  \pi { { R }_{ p } }^{ 2 }  &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the albedo would be zero (&lt;math&gt; a=0 &lt;/math&gt;) for a blackbody. However, in planetology, more useful results are obtained by accounting for a measured or assumed planetary albedo &lt;math&gt; a&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The infrared power radiated by the planet as thermal radiation will depend on its emissivity and its surface area, according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ out }= \epsilon \sigma A { T }^{ 4 }&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiated power, &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the [[emissivity]], σ the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], A the surface area, and T the absolute temperature.  For a [[sphere|spherical]] planet, the surface area is &lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi { { R }_{ p } }^{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt;.

The emissivity is typically assumed to be &lt;math&gt; \epsilon=1 &lt;/math&gt;, as would be the case for a perfectly emitting [[black body|blackbody]]. This is often a good assumption, as emissivities of natural surfaces tend to be in the range of 0.9 to 1, e.g. &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{Earth(Planet)}=0.96&lt;/math&gt;.

The equilibrium temperature is then calculated by setting P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;=P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus,

&lt;math&gt;{ T }_{ eq }={\left( { \frac {I_o \left( 1-a \right) }{ 4 \sigma } }\right)}^{ 1/4 } &lt;/math&gt;

===Theoretical model===

Consider a spherical star and a spherical planet. The star and the planet are considered to be perfect black bodies. The planet has an albedo and only absorbs a fraction of radiation, depending on its surface characteristics. The star emits [[isotropic radiator|radiation isotropically]] according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law which travels a distance equal to the [[Semi-major axis#Astronomy|orbital distance]] of the planet, D. The planet absorbs the radiation that isn't reflected by the albedo of the surface, and heats up. Since the planet is also a black body which emits radiation according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, it will emit radiation and lose energy. Thermal equilibrium exists when the power supplied by the star is equal to the power emitted by the planet. The temperature at which this balance occurs is the planetary equilibrium temperature and is equal to:

&lt;math&gt;{ T }_{ eq }={ T }{ \left( 1-a \right)  }^{ 1/4 }\sqrt { \frac { { R } }{ 2D }  } &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;{ T }&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; { R } &lt;/math&gt;
are the temperature and radius of the star.

The equilibrium temperature is neither an upper nor lower bound on actual temperatures on a planet. Because of the greenhouse effect, planets with atmospheres will have temperatures higher than the equilibrium temperature. For example, Venus has an equilibrium temperature of approximately 227 K, but a surface temperature of 740 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html|title=Venus Fact Sheet|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burro.astr.cwru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/equiltemp.html |title=Equilibrium Temperatures of Planets |publisher=Burro.astr.cwru.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moon]] has a black body temperature of 271 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html |title=Moon Fact Sheet |publisher=Nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can have temperatures of 373 K in the daytime and 100 K at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/14725-moon-temperature-lunar-days-night.html |title=What’s the Temperature on the Moon? &amp;#124; Lunar Temperatures |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the relatively slow rotation of the Moon compared to its size, so that the entire surface doesn't heat evenly.

===Detailed derivation of the planetary equilibrium temperature===

The power absorbed by the planet from the star is equal to the power emitted by the planet:
&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ in }={ P }_{ out }&lt;/math&gt; 
 
The power input to the planet is equal to the [[solar irradiance]] (''i.e.'' power received per unit area) of the star at the distance of the planet, I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, times the fraction absorbed by the planet (1 minus the [[albedo]]), times the area of the planet illuminated by the star:
&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ in }={ I_o } \left( 1-a \right)  \pi { { R }_{ p } }^{ 2 }  &lt;/math&gt;

I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the solar intensity at the distance of the planet from the sun, is equal to the [[luminosity]] (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) (''i.e.'' total power emitted) of the star divided by the area of the sphere that all of the star's radiation is cast on at the distance of the planet. This yields:
&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ in }={ L }\left( 1-a \right) \left( \frac { \pi { { R }_{ p } }^{ 2 } }{ 4\pi { D }^{ 2 } }  \right) &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;ref name="burro.astr.cwru" /&gt;

Any incoming power to a black body is radiated as heat according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] &lt;math&gt;P=\epsilon \sigma A { T }^{ 4 }&lt;/math&gt;.

(The emissivity &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is usually expected to be very close to 1, and thus is often left out).  Multiplying by the area, the power emitted by the planet is:
&lt;math&gt;{ P }_{ out }=\left( \epsilon \sigma { { T }_{ eq } }^{ 4 } \right) \left( 4\pi { { R }_{ p } }^{ 2 } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Setting these equal:

&lt;math&gt;{ T }_{ eq }={\left( { \frac { { L } \left( 1-a \right) }{ 16 \epsilon \sigma \pi { D }^{ 2 } } }\right)}^{ 1/4 } &lt;/math&gt;

The luminosity of the star is equal to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, times the area of the star, times the fourth power of the temperature of the star:
&lt;math&gt;{ L }=\left( \sigma { { T }}^{ 4 } \right) \left( 4\pi { { R } }^{ 2 } \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this into the previous equation, it can be shown that:

&lt;math&gt;{ T }_{ eq }={ T }{ \left( \frac {\left( 1-a \right)} { \epsilon} \right)  }^{ 1/4 }\sqrt { \frac { { R } }{ 2D }  } &lt;/math&gt;

By assuming that the [[emissivity]] &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1, this reproduces the equation in the previous section. The equilibrium temperature does not depend on the size of the planet, because both the incoming radiation and outgoing radiation depend on the area of the planet.

==Calculation for extrasolar planets==
For [[extrasolar planet]]s the temperature of the star can be calculated from the color of the star using [[Planck's law]]. The calculated temperature of the star can be used with the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] to determine the [[absolute magnitude]] of the star, which can then be used with observational data to determine the distance to the star and finally the size of the star. Orbital simulations are used to determine what orbital parameters (including orbital distance) produce the observations seen by astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1112/1112.4550.pdf pages 3-4]&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers use a hypothesized albedo &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1112/1112.4550.pdf page 16]&lt;/ref&gt; and can then estimate the equilibrium temperature.

==Machine learning with quantum computers==

Quantum-enhanced machine learning refers to [[quantum algorithm]]s that solve tasks in machine learning, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer to make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit could reveal the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal [[quantum computer]] to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.

===Linear algebra simulation with quantum amplitudes===

A number of quantum algorithms for machine learning are based on the idea of ''amplitude encoding'', that is, to associate the [[Probability amplitude|amplitudes]] of a quantum state with the inputs and outputs of computations.&lt;ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.130503|pmid=25302877|title=Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Data Classification|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=13|pages=130503|year=2014|last1=Rebentrost|first1=Patrick|last2=Mohseni|first2=Masoud|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113m0503R|arxiv=1307.0471|hdl=1721.1/90391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050505|pmid=23006156|title=Quantum Algorithm for Data Fitting|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=109|issue=5|pages=050505|year=2012|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|last2=Braun|first2=Daniel|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e0505W|arxiv=1204.5242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maria Schuld 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.022342|title=Prediction by linear regression on a quantum computer|journal=Physical Review A|volume=94|issue=2|pages=022342|year=2016|last1=Schuld|first1=Maria|last2=Sinayskiy|first2=Ilya|last3=Petruccione|first3=Francesco|bibcode=2016PhRvA..94b2342S|arxiv=1601.07823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1512.03929 |last1=Zhao |first1=Zhikuan |title=Quantum assisted Gaussian process regression |last2=Fitzsimons |first2=Jack K. |last3=Fitzsimons |first3=Joseph F. |class=quant-ph |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a state of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;qubits is described by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; complex amplitudes, this information encoding can allow for an exponentially compact representation. Intuitively, this corresponds to associating a discrete probability distribution over binary random variables with a classical vector. The goal of algorithms based on amplitude encoding is to formulate quantum algorithms whose resources grow polynomially in the number of qubits &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which amounts to a logarithmic growth in the number of amplitudes and thereby the dimension of the input.

Many quantum machine learning algorithms in this category are based on variations of the [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=0811.3171 |last1=Harrow |first1=Aram W. |title=Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=150502 |last2=Hassidim |first2=Avinatan |last3=Lloyd |first3=Seth |year=2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid=19905613 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103o0502H }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, under specific conditions, performs a matrix inversion using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in the dimensions of the matrix. One of these conditions is that a Hamiltonian which entrywise corresponds to the matrix can be simulated efficiently, which is known to be possible if the matrix is sparse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters |last1=Berry |first1= Dominic W.|last2=Childs |first2=Andrew M.|last3=Kothari|first3=Robin|date=2015 |publisher=IEEE |pages=792–809 |conference= 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2015.54|arxiv=1501.01715}}&lt;/ref&gt; or low rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphys3029|title=Quantum principal component analysis|journal=Nature Physics|volume=10|issue=9|pages=631|year=2014|last1=Lloyd|first1=Seth|last2=Mohseni|first2=Masoud|last3=Rebentrost|first3=Patrick|bibcode=2014NatPh..10..631L|arxiv=1307.0401|citeseerx=10.1.1.746.480}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reference, any known classical algorithm for [[matrix inversion]] requires a number of operations that grows [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations#Matrix algebra|at least quadratically in the dimension of the matrix]].

Quantum matrix inversion can be applied to machine learning methods in which the training reduces to solving a [[System of linear equations|linear system of equations]], for example in least-squares linear regression,&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maria Schuld 2016" /&gt; the least-squares version of [[support vector machine]]s,&lt;ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014" /&gt; and Gaussian processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A crucial bottleneck of methods that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation, which often requires one to initialise a quantum system in a state whose amplitudes reflect the features of the entire dataset. Although efficient methods for state preparation are known for specific cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012307|title=Efficient state preparation for a register of quantum bits|journal=Physical Review A|volume=73|issue=1|pages=012307|year=2006|last1=Soklakov|first1=Andrei N.|last2=Schack|first2=Rüdiger|bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2307S|arxiv=quant-ph/0408045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.160501|pmid=18518173|title=Quantum Random Access Memory|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=100|issue=16|pages=160501|year=2008|last1=Giovannetti|first1=Vittorio|last2=Lloyd|first2=Seth|last3=MacCone|first3=Lorenzo|bibcode=2008PhRvL.100p0501G|arxiv=0708.1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; this step easily hides the complexity of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphys3272|title=Read the fine print|journal=Nature Physics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=291–293|year=2015|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|bibcode=2015NatPh..11..291A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum machine learning algorithms based on Grover search===

Another approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses [[amplitude amplification]] methods based on [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search]] algorithm, which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the [[K-medians clustering|k-medians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aïmeur|first=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=2013-02-01|title=Quantum speed-up for unsupervised learning|journal=Machine Learning|language=en|volume=90|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1007/s10994-012-5316-5|issn=0885-6125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[k-nearest neighbour|k-nearest neighbors algorithms]].&lt;ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2014" /&gt; Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of [[perceptrons|perceptron]].&lt;ref name=wiebe2016nips&gt;{{cite conference |arxiv=1602.04799|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|title=Quantum Perceptron Models|last2=Kapoor|first2=Ashish|last3=Svore|first3=Krysta M.|conference=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|volume=29||pages=3999–4007|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models||bibcode=2016arXiv160204799W|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplitude amplification is often combined with [[quantum walk]]s to achieve the same quadratic speedup. Quantum walks have been proposed to enhance Google's PageRank algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/srep00444|pmid= 22685626|pmc= 3370332|title= Google in a Quantum Network|journal= Scientific Reports|volume= 2|issue= 444|pages= 444|year= 2012|last1= Paparo|first1= Giuseppe Davide|last2= Martin-Delgado|first2= Miguel Angel|bibcode= 2012NatSR...2E.444P|arxiv= 1112.2079}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the projective simulation framework.&lt;ref name=paparo2014quantum&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.4.031002|title=Quantum Speedup for Active Learning Agents|journal=Physical Review X|volume=4|issue=3|pages=031002|year=2014|last1=Paparo|first1=Giuseppe Davide|last2=Dunjko|first2=Vedran|last3=Makmal|first3=Adi|last4=Martin-Delgado|first4=Miguel Angel|last5=Briegel|first5=Hans J.|bibcode=2014PhRvX...4c1002P|arxiv=1401.4997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum sampling techniques===

Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with important applications across science, engineering, and society. Examples include [[deep learning]], [[probabilistic programming]], and other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

A computationally hard problem, which is key for some relevant machine learning tasks, is the estimation of averages over probabilistic models defined in terms of a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard: algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become. Even though [[quantum annealing|quantum annealers]], like those produced by D-Wave Systems, were designed for challenging combinatorial optimization problems, it has been recently recognized as a potential candidate to speed up computations that rely on sampling by exploiting quantum effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biswas |first1=Rupak |last2=Jiang |first2=Zhang |last3=Kechezi |first3=Kostya |last4=Knysh |first4=Sergey |last5=Mandrà |first5=Salvatore |last6=O’Gorman |first6=Bryan |last7=Perdomo-Ortiz |first7=Alejando |last8=Pethukov |first8=Andre |last9=Realpe-Gómez |first9=John |last10=Rieffel |first10=Eleanor|author1-link= Eleanor Rieffel |last11=Venturelli|first11=Davide|last12=Vasko|first12=Fedir|last13=Wang|first13=Zhihui |title=A NASA perspective on quantum computing: Opportunities and challenges |year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.parco.2016.11.002|journal=Parallel Computing|volume=64 |pages=81–98 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is to rely on a physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.

The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center has been recently used for the learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016b /&gt; Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks.&lt;ref name=Adachi2015 /&gt; The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016a /&gt; In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.

Inspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian was recently proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Amin |first1=Mohammad H. |last2=Andriyash |first2=Evgeny |last3=Rolfe |first3=Jason |last4=Kulchytskyy |first4=Bohdan |last5=Melko |first5=Roger |date=2016 |title=Quantum Boltzmann machines |journal=Phys.

This problem was, to some extent, circumvented by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities, allowing the authors to train the model efficiently by sampling. It is possible that a specific type of quantum Boltzmann machine has been trained in the D-Wave 2X by using a learning rule analogous to that of classical Boltzmann machines.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2016a /&gt;&lt;ref name="William G 1611"/&gt;

[[Quantum annealing]] is not the only technology for sampling. In a prepare-and-measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Wiebe |first1=Nathan |last2=Kapoor |first2=Ashish |last3=Svore |first3=Krysta M. |date=2014 |title=Quantum deep learning |eprint=1412.3489 |class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well-known classical counterparts. Relying on an efficient thermal state preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state, quantum-enhanced [[Markov logic network]]s exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the [[Graphical model|probabilistic graphical model]] generated by a [[first-order logic]] template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wittek |first1=Peter |last2=Gogolin |first2=Christian |date=2017 |title=Quantum Enhanced Inference in Markov Logic Networks |journal=Scientific Reports|doi=10.1038/srep45672|pmid=28422093 |pmc=5395824 |volume=7|issue=45672 |page=45672 |arxiv=1611.08104|bibcode=2017NatSR...745672W}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference, and, while the protocol relies on a universal quantum computer, under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware.

Recent work has shown that these models can be successfully learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of the given data via classical optimization, and there is some empirical evidence that these models can better model sequential data compared to classical HMMs in practice, although further work is needed to determine exactly when and how these benefits are derived.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, since classical HMMs are a particular kind of [[Bayesian network|Bayes net]], an exciting aspect of HQMMs is that the techniques used show how we can perform quantum-analogous [[Bayesian inference]], which should allow for the general construction of the quantum versions of [[Graphical model|probabilistic graphical models]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Fully quantum machine learning===
In the most general case of quantum machine learning, both the learning device and the system under study, as well as their interaction, are fully quantum. This section gives a few examples of results on this topic.

One class of problem that can benefit from the fully quantum approach is that of 'learning' unknown quantum states, processes or measurements, in the sense that one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system. For example, one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states, given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated, but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states. The naive approach would be to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sentís|first1=Gael|last2=Guţă|first2=Mădălin|last3=Adesso|first3=Gerardo|date=9 July 2015|title=Quantum learning of coherent states|journal=EPJ Quantum Technology|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjqt/s40507-015-0030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sasaki|first1=Masahide|last2=Carlini|first2=Alberto|date=6 August 2002|title=Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine|journal=Physical Review A|volume=66|issue=2|pages=022303|arxiv=quant-ph/0202173|bibcode=2002PhRvA..66b2303S|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022303}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bisio|first1=Alessandro|last2=Chiribella|first2=Giulio|last3=D’Ariano|first3=Giacomo Mauro|last4=Facchini|first4=Stefano|last5=Perinotti|first5=Paolo|date=25 March 2010|title=Optimal quantum learning of a unitary transformation|journal=Physical Review A|volume=81|issue=3|pages=032324|arxiv=0903.0543|bibcode=2010PhRvA..81c2324B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.032324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going beyond the specific problem of learning states and transformations, the task of [[quantum clustering|clustering]] also admits a fully quantum version, wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between data-points and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Clustering Algorithms|last1=Aïmeur|first1=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=1 January 2007|journal=Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning|isbn=9781595937933|pages=1–8|citeseerx=10.1.1.80.9513|doi=10.1145/1273496.1273497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a general framework spanning supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in,&lt;ref name="DunjkoTaylorBriegel" /&gt; where it was also shown that the possibility of probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in reinforcement learning.

==Classical learning applied to quantum systems==
The term quantum machine learning is also used for approaches that apply classical methods of machine learning to the study of quantum systems. A prime example is the use of classical learning techniques to process large amounts of experimental data in order to characterize an unknown quantum system (for instance in the context of [[Quantum information |quantum information theory]] and for the development of quantum technologies), but there are also more exotic applications.

The ability to experimentally control and prepare increasingly complex quantum systems brings with it a growing need to turn large and noisy data sets into meaningful information. This is a problem that has already been studied extensively in the classical setting, and consequently, many existing machine learning techniques can be naturally adapted to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems. For example, [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] methods and concepts of [[Algorithmic learning theory|algorithmic learning]] can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification,&lt;ref name="sentis2012quantum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sentís|first1=Gael|last2=Calsamiglia|first2=John|last3=Muñoz-Tapia|first3=Raúl|last4=Bagan|first4=Emilio|year=2012|title=Quantum learning without quantum memory|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=2|issue=|page=708|arxiv=1106.2742|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.708S|doi=10.1038/srep00708|pmc=3464493|pmid=23050092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamiltonian learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|last2=Granade|first2=Christopher|last3=Ferrie|first3=Christopher|last4=Cory|first4=David|year=2014|title=Quantum Hamiltonian learning using imperfect quantum resources|url=|journal=Physical Review A|volume=89|issue=4|page=042314|arxiv=1311.5269|bibcode=2014PhRvA..89d2314W|doi=10.1103/physreva.89.042314|hdl=10453/118943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the characterization of an unknown [[Unitary matrix|unitary transformation]].&lt;ref name="bisio2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bisio|first1=Alessandro|last2=Chiribella|first2=Giulio|last3=D'Ariano|first3=Giacomo Mauro|last4=Facchini|first4=Stefano|last5=Perinotti|first5=Paolo|year=2010|title=Optimal quantum learning of a unitary transformation|journal=Physical Review A|volume=81|issue=3|pages=032324|arxiv=0903.0543|bibcode=2010PhRvA..81c2324B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.032324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeongho|first1=|last2=Junghee Ryu|first2=Bang|last3=Yoo|first3=Seokwon|last4=Pawłowski|first4=Marcin|last5=Lee|first5=Jinhyoung|year=2014|title=A strategy for quantum algorithm design assisted by machine learning|url=|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=16|issue=1|page=073017|arxiv=1304.2169|bibcode=2014NJPh...16a3017K|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems that have been addressed with this approach are given in the following list:

==Quantum learning theory==

Quantum learning theory pursues a mathematical analysis of the quantum generalizations of classical learning models and of the possible speed-ups or other improvements that they may provide. The framework is very similar to that of classical [[computational learning theory]], but the learner in this case is a quantum information processing device, while the data may be either classical or quantum. Quantum learning theory should be contrasted with the quantum-enhanced machine learning discussed above, where the goal was to consider ''specific problems'' and to use quantum protocols to improve the time complexity of classical algorithms for these problems. Although quantum learning theory is still under development, partial results in this direction have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=A Survey of Quantum Learning Theory|date=2017|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1701.06806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point in learning theory is typically a ''concept class'', a set of possible concepts. Usually a concept is a function on some domain, such as &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the concept class could be the set of [[Disjunctive normal form|disjunctive normal form (DNF)]] formulas on ''n'' bits or the set of Boolean circuits of some constant depth. The goal for the learner is to learn
(exactly or approximately) an unknown ''target concept'' from this concept class. The learner may be actively interacting with the target concept, or passively receiving samples from it.

In active learning, a learner can make ''membership queries'' to the target concept ''c'', asking for its value ''c(x)'' on inputs ''x'' chosen by the learner. The learner then has to reconstruct the exact target concept, with high probability. In the model of ''quantum exact learning'', the learner can make membership queries in quantum superposition. If the complexity of the learner is measured by the number of membership queries it makes, then quantum exact learners can be polynomially more efficient than classical learners for some concept classes, but not more.&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gortler|first2=Steven J.|year=2004|title=Equivalences and Separations Between Quantum and Classical Learnability|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=33|issue=5|pages=1067–1092|doi=10.1137/S0097539704412910|last1=Servedio|first1=Rocco A.|citeseerx=10.1.1.69.6555}}&lt;/ref&gt; If complexity is measured by the amount of ''time''
the learner uses, then there are concept classes that can be learned efficiently by
quantum learners but not by classical learners (under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" /&gt;

A natural model of passive learning is Valiant's [[probably approximately correct learning|probably approximately correct (PAC) learning]]. Here the learner receives random examples ''(x,c(x))'', where ''x'' is distributed according to some unknown distribution ''D''. The learner's goal is to output a hypothesis function ''h'' such that ''h(x)=c(x)'' with high probability when ''x'' is drawn according to ''D''. The learner has to be able to produce such an 'approximately correct' ''h'' for every ''D'' and every target concept ''c'' in its concept class.
We can consider replacing the random examples by potentially more powerful quantum examples &lt;math&gt;\sum_x \sqrt{D(x)}|x,c(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. In the PAC model (and the related agnostic model), this doesn't significantly reduce the number of examples needed: for every concept class, classical and
quantum sample complexity are the same up to constant factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=Optimal Quantum Sample Complexity of Learning Algorithms|date=2016|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1607.00932}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for learning under some
fixed distribution ''D'', quantum examples can be very helpful, for example for learning DNF under
the uniform distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Jackson C.|year=1999|title=Learning DNF over the Uniform Distribution Using a Quantum Example Oracle|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=28|issue=3|pages=1136–1153|doi=10.1137/S0097539795293123|last1=Nader|first1=Bshouty H.|citeseerx=10.1.1.23.5709}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering ''time'' complexity, there exist concept classes that can be PAC-learned efficiently by quantum learners, even from classical examples, but not by classical learners (again, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).&lt;ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" /&gt;

This passive learning type is also the most common scheme in supervised learning: a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed, without the ability to query the label of unlabelled examples. Outputting a hypothesis ''h'' is a step of induction. Classically, an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase: the model parameters are estimated in the training phase, and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase. In the asymptotic limit of the number of applications, this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Gael|last2=Sentís|title=Inductive supervised quantum learning|year=2017|last1=Monràs|first1=Alex|last3=Wittek|first3=Peter|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=118|issue=19|pages=190503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.190503 |pmid=28548536|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118s0503M|arxiv=1605.07541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations and experiments==

The earliest experiments were conducted using the adiabatic [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave]] quantum computer, for instance, to detect cars in digital images using regularized boosting with a nonconvex objective function in a demonstration in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/de//googleblogs/pdfs/nips_demoreport_120709_research.pdf|title=NIPS 2009 Demonstration: Binary Classification using Hardware Implementation of Quantum Annealing|publisher=Static.googleusercontent.com|format=PDF|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments followed on the same architecture, and leading tech companies have shown interest in the potential of quantum machine learning for future technological implementations. In 2013, Google Research, [[NASA]], and the [[Universities Space Research Association]] launched the [[Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab]] which explores the use of the adiabatic D-Wave quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+QuantumAILab|title=Google Quantum A.I. Lab Team|date=31 January 2017|website=Google Plus|access-date=31 January 2017|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/physics/quail/|title=NASA Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|date=31 January 2017|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|access-date=31 January 2017|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example trained a probabilistic generative models with arbitrary pairwise connectivity, showing that their model is capable of generating handwritten digits as well as reconstructing noisy images of bars and stripes and handwritten digits.&lt;ref name="Benedetti2016a" /&gt;

Using a different annealing technology based on [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), a quantum [[Hopfield network]] was implemented in 2009 that mapped the input data and memorized data to Hamiltonians, allowing the use of adiabatic quantum computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Neves|first2=Jorge L.|last3=Sollacher|first3=Rudolf|last4=Glaser|first4=Steffen J.|year=2009|title=Quantum pattern recognition with liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance|journal=Physical Review A|volume=79|issue=4|pages=042321|arxiv=0802.1592|bibcode=2009PhRvA..79d2321N|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.79.042321|last1=Neigovzen|first1=Rodion}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMR technology also enables universal quantum computing{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, and it was used for the first experimental implementation of a quantum support vector machine to distinguish hand written number ‘6’ and ‘9’ on a liquid-state  quantum computer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaomei|last3=Xu|first3=Nanyang|last4=Du|first4=Jiangfeng|year=2015|title=Experimental Realization of a Quantum Support Vector Machine|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=14|pages=140504|arxiv=1410.1054|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114n0504L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.140504|pmid=25910101|last1=Li|first1=Zhaokai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training data involved the pre-processing of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image. Once the vectors are defined on the feature space, the quantum support vector machine was implemented to classify the unknown input vector. The readout avoids costly [[quantum tomography]] by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.

Photonic implementations are attracting more attention,&lt;ref name="WanDKGK16" /&gt; not the least because they do not require extensive cooling. Simultaneous spoken digit and speaker recognition and chaotic time-series prediction were demonstrated at data rates beyond 1 gigabyte per second in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Soriano|first2=Miguel C.|last3=Mirasso|first3=Claudio R.|last4=Fischer|first4=Ingo|year=2013|title=Parallel photonic information processing at gigabyte per second data rates using transient states|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=1364|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E1364B|doi=10.1038/ncomms2368|pmc=3562454|pmid=23322052|last1=Brunner|first1=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mabuchi|first2=Hideo|year=2015|title=A coherent perceptron for all-optical learning|journal=EPJ Quantum Technology|volume=2|arxiv=1501.01608|doi=10.1140/epjqt/s40507-015-0023-3|last1=Tezak|first1=Nikolas}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first experimentally demonstrated for up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a photonic quantum computer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wu|first2=D.|last3=Su|first3=Z.-E.|last4=Chen|first4=M.-C.|last5=Wang|first5=X.-L.|last6=Li|first6=Li|last7=Liu|first7=N.-L.|last8=Lu|first8=C.-Y.|last9=Pan|first9=J.-W.|year=2015|title=Entanglement-Based Machine Learning on a Quantum Computer|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=11|pages=110504|arxiv=1409.7770|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114k0504C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.110504|pmid=25839250|last1=Cai|first1=X.-D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, based on a neuromimetic approach, a novel ingredient has been added to the field of quantum machine learning, in the form of a so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical [[memristor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep29507 |pmid=27381511 |pmc=4933948 |title=Quantum memristors |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |issue=2016 |pages=29507 |year=2016|last1=Pfeiffer |first1=P. |last2=Egusquiza |first2=I.

An implementation of a quantum memristor in superconducting circuits has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep42044|pmid= 28195193|pmc= 5307327|last1= Salmilehto|first1= J.|title= Quantum Memristors with Superconducting Circuits|last2=  Deppe|first2= F.|last3=  Di Ventra|first3= M.|last4=  Sanz|first4= M.|last5=  Solano|first5= E.|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue= 42044|pages=42044|year= 2017|arxiv=1603.04487|bibcode=2017NatSR...742044S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experiment with quantum dots performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1612.08409|last1=Li|first1=Ying|title=A simple and robust quantum memristor|journal=Physical Review B|volume=96|issue=7|pages=075446|last2= Holloway|first2=Gregory W.|last3= Benjamin|first3=Simon C.|last4= Briggs|first4=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">'''Rhizodermis''' is the [[root]] [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] (also referred to as '''Epiblem'''), the outermost primary [[Cell (biology)|cell]] layer of the root.

Specialized rhisodermal cells, [[trichoblast]]s, form long tubular structures (from 5 to 17 micrometers in diameter and from 80 micrometers to 1.5 millimeters in length) almost perpendicular to the main cell axis - [[Trichome#Root hair|root hairs]] that absorb water and nutrients. Root hairs of the rhizodermis are always in close contact with soil particles and because of their high surface to volume ratio form an absorbing surface which is much larger than the transpiring surfaces of the plant.

With some species of the [[Fabaceae]] family, the rhizodermis participates in the recognition and the uptake of nitrogen-fixing [[Rhizobia]] bacteria - the first stage of nodulation leading to formation of [[root nodule]]s. Rhizodermis plays an important role in nutrient uptake by the plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Grunwaldt|first = G.|last2 = Ehwald|first2 = R.|last3 = Pietzsch|first3 = W.|last4 = Göring|first4 = H.|date = 1979-01-01|title = A Special Role of the Rhizodermis in Nutrient Uptake by Plant Roots|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015379617306492|journal = Biochemie und Physiologie der Pflanzen|volume = 174|issue = 9|pages = 831–837|doi = 10.1016/S0015-3796(17)30649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the epidermis, rhizodermis contains no stomata and it is not covered by cuticle, either. Its unique feature is the presence of root hairs. Root hair is the outgrowth of a single rhizodermal cell. They occur in high frequency in the adsorptive zone of the root. Root hair derives from a trichoblast as a result of an unequal division. It contains a large vacuole; its cytoplasm and nucleus is superseded to the apical region of the outgrowth. Although it does not divide, its DNA replicates so the nucleus is polyploid. Root hairs live only for few days, they die off in 1-2 days due to mechanical damages.

{{Music education|settings}}
A '''school band''' is a group of [[student]] musicians who rehearse and perform [[instrumental]] [[music]] together. A [[concert band]] is usually under the direction of one or more [[conducting|conductors]] (band directors). A school band consists of [[woodwind instrument]]s, brass instruments and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instruments, although upper level bands may also have [[string basses]] or [[bass guitar]].

School bands in the [[United Kingdom]] are generally similar to those in the US although pure brass bands are more commonplace in schools than in the US. Some countries usually prefer certain special types of bands, usually drums, over conventional ones. The school band movement in Japan is unusually strong, organized around an enormous competition system administered by the [[All-Japan Band Association]]. Many international observers of Japanese school bands consider them to be the most impressive in the world, particularly among very young students, and Japan is also home to one of the world's leading professional concert bands, the [[Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra]].

==Middle school/Elementary school bands==
[[Image:JapaneseJr.HighBand.jpg|thumb|Junior High School Students band at Demachi Jr. High, Tonami City, Toyama, Japan]]
Although some children learn an instrument prior to entering a [[middle school]] (or junior high), students in [[music education]] programs within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] generally start daily band classes in the 6th or 7th Grade. Many band programs begin as early as 4th or 5th grade. The students usually make up a band based upon their grade, which may then be broken up into sectionals to provide better instrument-specific instruction. It is sometimes required for beginner students to play a recorder for a year before learning another instrument, so that basics, such as scales, [[embouchure]], etc. can be taught easily.  Other requirements may include learning a piano or guitar to understand basic music theory, notation, etc.

A "beginning" band, consisting of the youngest students in the school, usually gives two or three [[concerts]] a year, and may participate in a local/state contest. These bands are given easy music to learn, often with many duplicate parts and simple [[rhythms]]. Students sometimes may be required to memorize the [[Major Scale|12 major scales]].
Depending upon the size of the school,  there may be one to three "higher level" bands after the beginning band. These bands are usually divided similarly to [[high school]] bands. Some schools require students to audition and be placed in a band according to their ability on their instrument. Others will assign students based on their performance as seen in class. Yet others will simply sort the students according to their age or grade level. Most of these decisions are decided by the conductor.  These higher level bands will occasionally play in high school games and pep rallies to augment the local high school band, although in small schools they always come to these events. Beginning bands usually are used in the spot of an elective.

Instruments typically in beginning bands:

*Woodwind:
**[[Flutes]],
**[[Oboes]], 
**[[Clarinets]],
**Alto, Tenor, and occasionally Baritone [[saxophones]],
**[[Bassoons]]
*Brass:
**[[Tuba]]s,
**[[Trombones]],
**[[Trumpets]],
**[[French Horns]],
**Occasionally [[baritone horn|Baritones]], or [[Euphoniums]]

Some bands will also have a ''percussion kit'', which will allow them to play bells and drums

==High school bands==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - G 14 - Life in Ziguinchor, Senegal - PAIGC boarding school band, Ziguinchor - 1973.tif|thumb|[[PAIGC]] High school band in [[Ziguinchor]], Senegal, 1973]]
High school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. Music is much more difficult with more complex passages, intricate rhythms and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious '[[program music]]' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of [[music education]] available to them in school. [[March (music)|Marches]] were the first major contributions to the wind band repertoire.  There are many pieces other than marches written for wind band at present, but there are some historical standards that should be included into the repertoire of advanced ensembles.   Some of the most notable of these pieces are [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|First Suite in E-flat]]'' and ''[[Second Suite in F for Military Band|Second Suite in F]]'', and [[Percy Grainger|Grainger's]] ''Children's March'' and ''[[Lincolnshire Posy]]'' among others.

Below is a list of the [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] in a typical [[concert band]] at the high school level. The number of instruments in each section varies, but listed below are usually the average number of members. Middle school/junior high bands are usually around the upper values for each instrument. Instrumentation in beginner bands is usually much larger than this. College and professional bands generally have smaller numbers of players. These numbers may vary widely, based on the instrument and the people playing them (as many people playing instruments such as trombones may drop out, causing others to change instruments to fill the need).  Some bands have a set number of performers per section while other bands have open unlimited participation.

'''Woodwind'''
*1 or no [[Piccolo|Piccolo in C]]
*8-10 [[Flute]]s
*1-2 [[Oboe]]s
* 1 or no [[Cor anglais|English Horn]]
*1-2 [[Bassoon]]s

*8-10 [[Soprano clarinet|B♭ Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Alto clarinet|E♭ Alto Clarinet]]
*1-2  [[Bass clarinet|B♭ Bass Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Contra-alto clarinet|EE♭ Contra-alto Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Contrabass clarinet|BB♭ Contrabass Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Soprano saxophone|B♭ Soprano Saxophone]]
*4-6 [[Alto saxophone|E♭ Alto Saxophones]]

*1-4 [[Baritone horn]]s or [[Euphonium]]s
*1-4 [[Tuba]]s

'''Strings'''
*1 or no [[String Bass]] or [[Bass Guitar|Electric Bass]]

'''Percussion'''
* Percussionists playing:
*[[Snare drum]]
*[[Tom-tom drum|Tom-toms]]
*[[Bass drum]]
*[[Cymbal]]s including [[Crash cymbal|crash]], [[Ride cymbal|ride]], and [[suspended cymbal|suspended]]
*[[Tambourine]]
*2 playing [[Mallet Percussion]], including [[orchestra bells]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]], [[chimes]] and [[vibraphone]]
*1 [[Timpani]]
*1 [[Drum kit]]
*A variety of other auxiliary percussion instruments used on specific pieces, including [[Cabasa]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]], and [[Maraca]]s.

In most middle school bands, strings (besides the string bass) are not used. If they are, the band is generally considered an orchestra.

The first high school band in the United States was the Boston Farm and Trade School Band, founded in 1856.
The oldest high school band in America is [[The Christian Brothers Band (Memphis)]] founded in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Patrick (2009). The Christian Brothers Band, "The Oldest High School Band in America" 1872-1937. Christian Brothers Archives: Master's Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College bands==
Many colleges/universities have band as a class. Some are integrated within a 'Music' course while others are not. They tend to be larger than a high school band and play at a higher level.

==Other school bands==
There are many other school band opportunities for students. Most of these fall under the jurisdiction of the director that teaches the daily band classes, whether or not the smaller groups meet daily or during school hours.

[[Image:TTUband.jpg|thumb|left|[[Texas Tech University Goin' Band from Raiderland|Goin' Band from Raiderland]], a college marching band in the United States]]

===Marching band===
{{Main|Marching band}}
Many schools, especially high schools in the United States, have a [[marching band]]. A school marching band may contain from 11 to over 500 students.  Marching bands often practice frequently during the late summer and early fall and most often attend their school's [[American football|football]] games, playing music in the stands, and marching a show during halftime. A show is usually between 6 and 10 minutes long, but many competitions place restrictions on length. Bands often compete in marching band competitions throughout the marching season (typically the same time as football season). Competitions vary in intensity. Some areas have many smaller, local competitions hosted by individual schools. Others host a regional competition.  Others, such as [[Bands of America]] competitions are nationally known and take place in professional arenas.

In addition to their show, marching bands often march parades. Often this is limited to their city or town's municipal parades, but some bands travel to participate in well known parades, such as the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on New Years Day.

===Jazz band===
{{Main|Jazz band}}
Many schools have jazz programs in addition to their concert program. Different schools have different time slots for their jazz band. Some meet as an actual class during the school day. Others choose to practice after school or before school two or three times a week. Meeting as a class during school can often cause schedule conflicts with students' academic classes.  Many times jazz band may rehearse during the [[study hall]], [[free period]], or part of the  lunch period. Typical instrumentation for jazz ensembles will include trumpets, trombones, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, a drum set (often called a "trap set",) guitar, bass guitar, piano, clarinet and often, a vibraphone or marimba. Many areas have jazz festivals, but the popularity of these widely vary from different regions of the country. Jazz bands are most often used as an ambassador ensemble for the band program as a whole.  In addition, jazz education is seen as growing in popularity as a specialty area within school music departments. Possibly a person can only be in the jazz band if they are 7th grade or higher.

===Chamber ensembles===
Schools rarely have chamber music ensembles that meet as real classes, usually depending on the region, state and budget. Most of these groups are ''ad hoc'' ensembles put together by the director or the students themselves for a contest or recital. Examples would be clarinet quartets, woodwind quintet, brass quintet, duets, and trios. Groups consisting of the entire woodwind or brass section, or even percussion section of a band are also sometimes formed.

===All-region bands===
Perhaps not associated with the individual school, All-Region bands are audition-only groups for the most advanced players in each school. There are many different "All-Region" bands, ranging from the most local "All-County" or "All-District"(when referring to school districts) to the more prestigious "All-State".  Many states also have a level between County and State bands which varies in name according to the area. These events are often highly enjoyed by the students that attend them. Musical literature is often increased in difficulty for the concerts, providing a challenge that isn't seen at schools. Students also get to meet new players on their instrument and share stories from their own band experiences. Region bands typically last over a weekend, though some may meet for over a week before performing a concert.

Though not associated with All-State, [[Florida]] has a statewide band festival called Festival of Winds, held in [[Tampa]] at [[The University of South Florida]] in the first weekend of December. Also, Florida, [[Alabama]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] have a band festival called Tri-State, held in [[Tallahassee]], Florida at [[Florida State University]] in the same time period as Festival of Winds.

===Modern band===

Modern band &lt;ref&gt;''Modern Band: The Next Step in the Evolution of Music'' from ''School Band and Orchestra'' (March, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  is an instrumental and vocal school music program taught in a growing number of public schools systems in the U.S.  Instrumentation typically includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, vocals, computers and percussion instruments. The repertoire of modern band is evolving as it draws from commercially dominant and contemporary music styles of the day such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[disco]], [[reggae]], [[hip-hop]] and more.

Major public school systems that offer Modern Band programming include those in the [[New York City Department of Education]], [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], [[Chicago Public Schools]] and others. Modern band is a new movement in public school music education circles. The term "Modern Band" was coined by a music education non-profit, Little Kids Rock, who partners with school districts from economically challenged communities to expand their music programs.

==Stereotypes and popular culture==

==='Band geek'===
{{redirect2|Band geek|Band geeks|the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode|Band Geeks}}
"Band geek" or "band [[nerd]]" is a [[high school stereotype]] of a person obsessed with playing band music. However, the term usually relates to the belief that most people who are in school bands are socially inept.&lt;ref&gt;Patnaik, G. and Shinseki, M. (2000) ''The Secret Life of Teens: Young People Speak Out About Their Lives.'' HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilsland, B. (2004) ''What It Means To Be In A Marching Band: A Band Geek Perspective For The Musically Challenged.'' Authorhouse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, A. (2003) ''Lita: A Less Traveled R.O.A.D.--The Reality of Amy Dumas.'' Simon and Schuster. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes used to describe any student who plays an instrument and is in a band class (including students in the [[String orchestra|orchestra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, J.L. (2004) ''Taste Berries for Teens #4: Inspirational Short Stories and Encouragement.'' HCI Teens Publishing. p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willman, C. (2005) ''Rednecks &amp; Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music.'' p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Orch dork" is a variation specifically for members of school [[orchestra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Z. (2003) ''Please Don't Kill the Freshman: A Memoir.'' HarperCollins. p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have become a label of pride for many band members, being found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Gender stereotypes in instrument selection===
In school bands, more girls than boys tend to play most woodwind instruments, especially flute, and more boys than girls tend to play brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  However, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |title=Influences of Gender and Sex-Stereotyping of Middle School Students' Perception and Selection of Musical Instruments: A Review of the Literature |author=Mark J. Walker |journal=Visions of Research in Music Education |date=January 2004 |volume=4 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002080741/http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stereotypes can be avoided when band directors assess each student for musical capacity, as well as, meet with students individually to analyze their physical characteristics.  For example, petite students would be more successful playing the clarinet over the tuba.  Additionally, the role of gender bias in musical instrument assignment is highly debated in the field of music education.  Some feel that it should be left alone while others want to combat it.  One way band directors can overcome these stereotypes is to have live demonstrations from musicians playing gender atypical instruments (i.e., males playing flute, females playing tuba).&lt;ref&gt;Dale, E. B. (2005). An investigation of the instrument selection processes used by directors of beginning band. Contributions to Music Education, 32(1), 9-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{notability|date=May 2016}}
'''Social architecture''' is the conscious design of an environment that encourages a desired range of social behaviors leading towards some goal or set of goals. The environment social architecture influences may be [[Social structure|social systems]], or digital spaces such as [[Social media|media]] tools (sometimes synonymous with [[Web 2.0]]) and [[User experience design|UX strategy]]. In building design it can refer to the architecture of social spaces such as bars and restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Gatsby. "Social Architecture: A New Approach To Designing Social Spaces." ''Huffington Post'' 06/05/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In social systems, "social architects" seek to modify human behaviors ([[behavior modification|behavior change]]) through carefully designed programs or workshops that seek to involve the members of a population to improve, for example, the livability and safety or environmental impact of their own communities.

In digital spaces,  "social architecture" is sometimes confused with "[[information architecture]]" or "[[interaction design]]".

The theory of social architecture can be applied to solve talent attraction and retention issues, while simultaneously combating a community's social issues. The Milwaukee-based firm, [http://www.newaukee.com NEWaukee] is the first social architecture firm in the United States.

== Architecture of On-Line Communities ==
In September 2011 [[Pieter Hintjens]] presented "Social Architecture 101" at Mix-IT in Lyon. Hintjens defined the term like this: "Social Architecture by analogy with conventional architecture, is the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/pieterh/social-architecture101 Social Architecture 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintjens' 2016 book, "Social Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Social-Architecture-Building--line-Communities-ebook/dp/B01F8I7Z7E Pieter Hintjens, "Social Architecture: Building On-line Communities", 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a theoretical framework and a set of tools for building online communities, including a contribution process&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/ (C4)]&lt;/ref&gt; for open source software communities. The book refers to the [[ZeroMQ]] community as an example built using these tools and process.

== Kevin Werbach's interview on Amy Jo Kim ==
[[Amy Jo Kim]] is an American author and researcher on the subject of developing online communities. On [[Kevin Werbach]] interview on Amy Jo Kim. Kevin states that "Amy Jo Kim is an expert in the development of social architectures."

== Social architecture on team-building ==

Social Architecture is different from interaction design and information architecture. Rather, it can be illustrated with the combination of two. Specifically, the idea is to use structural (e.g. software, organizational rule) tools to design a socio-technical infrastructure for participants to behave in the wanted direction of the designer. It can be used as a conceptual framework for directing building a real-world community of which member communication is mostly taking off online. Social architecture aims for creating an effective infrastructure for non-face-to-face communication and management.

As more and more across-devices team-building platform (such as [https://slack.com Slack] [http://basecamp.com Basecamp]\[https://www.teambition.com Teambition]\[https://tower.im Tower.im]) has been used, they provide some empirically-designed communication pattern for new joined teams whose major communications taking off online.

The popular team-building platforms have some common features that their designers see as providing more efficient online communications. Mostly the team leader (or any member) will create a team on the platform with customizable name and invite other team members to join this team. The created team will be able to use designed features from the platform. They include:

'''Newsfeed''': Similar to Facebook's news feed, it is a semi-public feed where all joined team members can post or update their thoughts and get immediate or delayed feedback from other team members.

'''Discussion Board:''' Team members can create threads related to topics for all members to participate in discussing.

'''File Sharing:''' Team member can upload files from their multi-platform devices and cloud storage.

'''Chatroom and Private chat:''' They provide real-time chat among all team members or between specific team members.

'''Task-distribution and checklist:''' Team members can(be) distribute tasks and set deadlines.

'''Calendar:''' A shared calendar with deadlines and important dates.

'''''Tigriopus brevicornis''''' (often called a Tigger-pod) is a [[coast]]al [[Marine biology|marine]] [[copepod]].&lt;ref name="marinespecies1"/&gt; They are a dominant member of shallow supra tidal [[Tide pool|rock]] pools along the North Western European coastline. A broad range of studies have been carried out on this species, including: its [[ecology]], [[physiology]], [[phylogeography]], [[metapopulation]] [[genetics]], [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[reproductive behaviour]]. ''T. brevicornis'' has also recently been used in [[ecotoxicology]] studies and has been trialled as a live feed for [[larvae]] in several [[aquaculture]]-based studies for the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Theilacker, G. H., &amp; Kimball,  a. S. (1984). Comparative quality of rotifers and copepods as foods for larval fishes. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations Reports, 25(August 1983), 80–86. https://swfsc.noaa.gov/publications/CR/1984/8491.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and Ecology ==
This species of harpacticoid [[copepod]] is found in high shore splash pools on coastlines ranging from [[Portugal]] in the south to [[Iceland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] in the north. Sometimes it can be found below the high tide mark however, like in [[Geography of Sweden|Sweden]], where it was found at depths of 10 metres in the [[Littoral zone|subtidal]].&lt;ref name="handschumacher1"&gt;Handschumacher, L., Steinarsdóttir, M. B., Edmands, S., &amp; Ingólfsson, A. (2010). Phylogeography of the rock-pool copepod Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in the northern North Atlantic, and its relationship to other species of the genus. Marine Biology, 157(6), 1357–1366. http://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1415-7&lt;/ref&gt; These splash pools occur several metres above the high tide mark, isolated from the main coastal water as a microenvironment that can vary dramatically in chemical factors such as [[salinity]], [[temperature]] and [[oxygen]] levels over relatively short temporal scales. ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' has the ability to survive these variable [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] conditions (factors that limit predators such as fish to lower pools in the [[intertidal zone]]) and as a result is known as a [[euryhaline]] [[osmoconformer]]. Temperatures in supratidal splash pools tend to track air temperatures more closely than ocean temperatures as they are often extremely shallow (only a few cm deep to a few meters deep). Salinity also changes as the pools [[evaporate]] or fill up (from 0-150 PSU) as the pools receive freshwater inputs from rain (especially so in the [[West of Ireland]]) and saltwater from wave action during [[spring tide]]s or storm surges.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;McAllen, R. J., Taylor, A. C., &amp; Davenport, J. (1998). Osmotic and body density response in the Harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis in supralittoral rock pools. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 78(04), 1143–1153. Retrieved from http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0025315400044386&lt;/ref&gt; The orange pigment [[Astaxanthin]] is synthesised by the organism as an aid against UVAR and UVBR radiation from the sun, as rock pools can be quite exposed to [[desiccation]]. The copepod's diet of [[phytoplankton]] who are rich in Highly [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|Unsaturated]] Fatty Acids (HUFAs) allow them to synthesise this protective [[protein]], granting them [[Desiccation tolerance|tolerance]] to radiation year-round.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, J., Healy, A., Casey, N., &amp; Heffron, J. J. a. (2004). Diet-dependent UVAR and UVBR resistance in the high shore harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 276(1), 299–303. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps276299&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the pools, these relatively small (~1&amp;nbsp;mm long adult) organisms can thrive as [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] [[Benthos|benthic]] foragers, feeding primarily on [[biofilm]]s of phytoplankton and other [[Microorganism|microbes]] on the rock pool bed. They also feed on [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] phytoplankton present in the water and on [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] biofilms covering the dominant rock pool alga; [[Ulva intestinalis|Enteromorpha intestinalis]]. Aside from a feeding platform, ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' take advantage of the algae's hollow nature and are known to dwell within the actual [[Ulva intestinalis|thallus]] of the green macroalga. Especially during times of [[desiccation]], the thallus provides a moist [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] for the copepod when [[Tide pool|rock]] pools completely dry out. Several hundred individuals can be found in a single strand of the hollow [[Ulva intestinalis|seaweed]], where they can survive weeks longer compared to natural [[desiccation]]. Even when [[Ulva intestinalis|Enteromorpha]] spp. aren't present in splash pools and conditions are getting too dry, the copepod can [[burrow]] down where the loose sandstone still holds moisture. These behavioural [[adaptation]]s may be a key explanation in how this species can live and thrive in such an environment as extreme and as variable as the [[Intertidal zone|supratidal]].&lt;ref&gt;McAllen, R. (1999). Enteromorpha intestinalis-a refuge for the supralittoral rockpool harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 79(6), 1125–1126. http://doi.org/10.1017/S0025315499001393&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the [[Harpacticoida|Harpacticoid]] copepods of the [[genus]] Tigriopus Norman 1868, ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' belong to the subclass [[Copepod]]a which is of high [[Food web|ecological]] importance. Copepoda is the second largest [[Crustacean]] taxa and approximately 12,000 species of copepods have been described. They are one of the dominant [[Taxon|taxa]] in aquatic [[zooplankton]] communities representing 70% of the ocean’s [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and thus the principal link between the [[phytoplankton]] and higher [[Trophic level|trophic]] levels. Harpacticoids also play an important role in the marine meiobenthic [[Food web|food]] web, especially as food for [[Juvenile fish|juvenile]] fish.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Raisuddin, S., Kwok, K. W. H., Leung, K. M. Y., Schlenk, D., &amp; Lee, J. S. (2007). The copepod Tigriopus: A promising marine model organism for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. Aquatic Toxicology, 83(3), 161–173. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.04.005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogeography, Metapopulation and Genetics studies==
Supratidal splash pools are often so high on the [[shore]]line that they can become isolated from the coastal water and neighbouring pools for long periods of time. From this, scientists have speculated whether these neighbouring pools actually have different [[population]]s of copepods, and found that some pools only metres apart may never share [[genes]] through [[Gene flow|cross breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Wormhoudt, A. (2015). Seasonal and Cyclical Changes in Genetic Composition of the Marine Intertidal Rock Pool Copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. Biochemical Genetics, 53(4-6), 79–92. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10528-015-9674-0&lt;/ref&gt; The upper shore rock pool mosaic with interspersed copepod [[Community (ecology)|communities]] therefore forms a [[metapopulation]]. This is a rare occurrence in a [[marine biology|marine]] system, where [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] ability is usually less impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. P. (2001). Metapopulation dynamics of Tigriopus brevicornis (Harpacticoida) in intertidal rock pools. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 211, 215–224. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps211215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altermatt, F., Bieger, A., &amp; Morgan, S. (2012). Habitat characteristics and metapopulation dynamics of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 468, 85–93. http://doi.org/10.3354/meps09994&lt;/ref&gt; This extremely restricted dispersal has perplexed researchers, as phylogeographical studies have shown that despite this, distant relatives of ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' were capable of occasional long distance transport, [[colonising]] large [[geographic]] areas within the last 12 to 15 thousand years. A 1&amp;nbsp;mm long copepod somehow managed to traverse the Atlantic Ocean in the past - over 4000 kilometres.&lt;ref name="handschumacher1"/&gt;

== Reproduction and Development ==
''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' undergoes several stages of [[Developmental biology|development]], with 12 distinctive post-embryonic developmental stages; 6 [[Crustacean larvae|naupliar]] (copepod baby) stages, 5 copepodid (teenage) stages and an adult stage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Animals are sexually [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] and males are usually slightly smaller than females, possessing enlarged [[Antenna (biology)|antennules]]. These antennules are used to perform a characteristic [[Mate guarding|mate]]-guarding behaviour to secure a potential mate, where they grasp females before the actual [[mating]] event. Mating pairs will stay attached for several hours, and [[sperm]] is stored in a special organ known as a [[spermatheca]]. Females are highly [[Fertility|fecund]] and usually bear multiple [[Offspring|broods]] of [[Egg cell|eggs]] developed sequentially after a single mating with brood sizes of 30–50 [[Crustacean larvae|nauplii]]. [[Fertilisation|Fertilised]] ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' females are easily identifiable by the presence of a large dark egg sac attached to their hind [[Segmentation (biology)|segment]]. Other ''Tigriopus spp.'' females have varying numbers of egg sacs attached posteriorly (see image below).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J.H., 1936. The occurrence, ecology and life history of Tigriopus fulvus (Fischer). J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U.K. 20, 523–536.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Different T. brevicornis developmental stages.

[[File:Tigriopus brevicornis female.png|thumb|T. brevicornis female with characteristic single posterior egg sac.]]

== Behaviour ==
Studies on different behavioural traits of this species has been useful for understanding how it survives in its [[Tide pool|extreme]] environment.

=== Swimming and Feeding===
Although classed as a [[Benthos|benthic]] copepod, this particular species of ''Tigriopus'' is surprisingly [[Motility|motile]], and has been noted to spend prolonged amounts of time in the water column of experimental mesocosms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;De Troch, M., Chepurnov, V. a., Vincx, M., &amp; Ólafsson, E. (2008). The effect of Fucus vesiculosus on the grazing of harpacticoid copepods on diatom biofilms. Journal of Sea Research, 60(3), 139–143. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2008.05.005&lt;/ref&gt; While copepodites (adults) have six pairs of [[Carapace|cephalic]] [[appendage]]s used for swimming and food collection and up to five pairs of specialized ‘‘swimming legs’’ allocated for jumping, nauplii have only three pairs of appendages to be used for motion and feeding. Therefore, the kinematics of nauplii is different from that of adults. They have a swimming-by-jumping propulsion mode, with alternating power and recovery strokes of three pairs of cephalic appendages. This is fundamentally different from the way other [[Plankton|microplankton]] move, and the propulsion efficiency of the nauplii is low.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen Borg, C. M., Bruno, E., &amp; Kiørboe, T. (2012). The Kinematics of Swimming and Relocation Jumps in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 33–35. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047486&lt;/ref&gt; Very early ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' naupliar stages tend to crawl on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] they are feeding on, and this may hinder their motility even further. An interesting trait of some nauplii is to beat their appendages while being stationary, which results in the creation of a strong feeding [[Current (fluid)|current]] that is about 10 times faster than the average translation speed of the nauplius. More efficient feeding is a result of this clever adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, E., Andersen Borg, C. M., &amp; Kiørboe, T. (2012). Prey Detection and Prey Capture in Copepod Nauplii. PLoS ONE, 7(10), 1–8. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047906&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannibalism ===
Adult ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' have been shown to eat the first two developmental stages of [[Crustacean larvae|nauplii]] (N1 and N2) when population [[Population density|densities]] are high or when food availability is low. Speculation concerning the females' ability to recognise their own young and therefore not eat them is no longer supported, as more recent studies have indicated that this [[Offspring|kin]] [[Kin recognition|recognition]] does not exist within the ''Tigriopus'' genus. This is further supported by the fact that ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' produce several large [[Clutch (eggs)|broods]] of eggs per year, and any form of parental [[Parental care|care]] would be highly unlikely given their huge energy investment in producing so many offspring.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Gallucci, F., &amp; Ólafsson, E. (2007). Cannibalistic behaviour of rock-pool copepods: An experimental approach for space, food and kinship. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 342(2), 325–331. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2006.11.004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Given the species' high natural abundances and their occurrence as a [[Nuisance wildlife management|nuisance]] species in some [[Brine shrimp|brine]] shrimp / [[rotifer]] [[aquaculture]] tanks, these copepods were further researched as a potential live feed for larviculture thereafter.

=== Aquaculture ===
''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'' and many other copepod species have been analysed for their effectiveness as a live feed in marine larviculture ([[Ichthyoplankton|larvae]] [[aquaculture]]). Essentially, the larval stage of most fish and crustaceans is the most important for healthy [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Developmental biology|development]] into an economically feasible human [[Fish farming|commodity]]. When the fish larvae are fed with traditional feeds of [[Brine shrimp|brine]] shrimp or [[rotifer]]s, these larvae can develop growth defects and malpigmentation can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;Støttrup, J. G. (2006). A Review on the Status and Progress in Rearing Copepods for Marine Larviculture . Advantages and Disadvantages . Among Calanoid , Harpacticoid and Cyclopoid Copepods. Avances En Nutrición Acuícola VIII, (October), 62–83&lt;/ref&gt; Copepods are rich in Highly [[Unsaturated fat|Unsaturated]] Fatty Acids (HUFAs) which are essential for optimal fish larvae growth and development. The copepod is a [[Commercial fish feed|product]], reared in huge hundred litre tanks, fed with nearby-cultured micro algae and the nauplii would be constantly filtered out, leaving the adults and copepodites (teenagers) inside the mass culture vessels. These naulpii would be introduced to the larval rearing tanks where the larvae preferentially eat the nauplii.&lt;ref&gt;Drillet, G., Frouël, S., Sichlau, M. H., Jepsen, P. M., Højgaard, J. K., Joardeer, A. K., &amp; Hansen, B. W. (2011). Status and recommendations on marine copepod cultivation for use as live feed. Aquaculture. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.02.027&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for ''T.&amp;nbsp;brevicornis'''s effectiveness as a live feed are numerous:
* They have a generally short body size ({{nowrap|&lt; 1 mm}} for adults and nauplii are ~75&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Støttrup, J. G. (2000). The elusive copepods: Their production and suitability in marine aquaculture. Aquaculture Research, 31(8-9), 703–711. http://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2000.00488.x&lt;/ref&gt;
* They can reach high population growth rates (independent of high densities) with relatively short [[generation]] times (~ 3 to 4 weeks) all of which can be attained in mass culture systems.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;
[[File:Cultured Tigriopus brevicornis fed with Ulva intestinalis.jpg|thumb|Scanning image of a Western Irish population of Tigriopus brevicornis. After death, the Orange pigment Astaxanthin becomes intensified.]]
* Nauplii and adults swim in the water column, except the first two naupliar stages who crawl on the [[Substrate (biology)|substratum]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] only occurs by adults on the first two naupliar stages, which can be avoided by the aforementioned filtration system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;
* Cheap and versatile feeding due to their generalistic feeding habits - they have the ability to transform simple sugars into complex [[biomolecule]]s. They will eat anything from [[baker's yeast]] to fruit juice to any formulated [[Aquarium fish feed|fish feed]].&lt;ref&gt;Ajiboye, O., Yakubu, A. F., Adams, T. E., Olaji, E. D., &amp; Nwogu, N. A. (2011). A review of the use of copepods in marine fish larviculture. Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries. http://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-010-9169-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rich presence of Highly [[Unsaturated fat|Unsaturated]] Fatty Acids (HUFAs) when fed [[Microphyte|microalgae]]. This HUFA content can be maintained even after the individual has been frozen at -80 degrees Celsius and processed into a commercial paste to maximise transport potential and shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;Olivotto, I., Tokle, N. E., Nozzi, V., Cossignani, L., &amp; Carnevali, O. (2010). Preserved copepods as a new technology for the marine ornamental fish aquaculture: A feeding study. Aquaculture, 308(3-4), 124–131. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.08.033&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extreme stress [[Desiccation tolerance|tolerance]] allows the species to be grown in many different [[Climate|conditions]] and locations around the globe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5554">'''Trophic mutualism''' is a key type of ecological [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Specifically, "trophic mutualism" refers to the transfer of energy and nutrients between two species. This is also sometimes known as resource-to-resource mutualism. Trophic mutualism often occurs between an [[autotroph]] and a [[heterotroph]].&lt;ref&gt;Odum, Eugene. Fundamentals of Ecology. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1971.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many examples of trophic mutualisms, the heterotroph is generally a fungus or bacteria.  This mutualism can be both [[obligate]] and opportunistic.

==Examples ==

*'''Rhizobia''' – [[Rhizobia]] are bacteria that conduct [[nitrogen fixation]] for legume plants. Specifically, these bacteria can be from generas ''Allorhizobium, Azorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, or Sinorhizobium''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Vessey, K.J., K. Pawlowski, and B. Bergman, Root-based N2-fixing symbioses: Legumes, actinorhizal plants, Parasponiasp. and cycads. Plant and Soil 2005. 266(1-2): p. 205-230.&lt;/ref&gt; In this mutualistic relationship, the bacteria grow on or within the root hair and penetrate into the plant tissues&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Townsend, C.R., M. Begon, and J.L. Harper, Essentials Of Ecology Third Edition 2008, Malden, MA: Backwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact means of interaction between the Rhizobia and plant varies with genus and species, all forms of this interaction are made up of the infection of bacteria, bacteria colonization, control of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and exchange of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The role that rhizobia play in fixing nitrogen for legumes is the basis for why legumes can be used in [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Saito, K., B. Linquist, and B. Keobualapha, Stylosanthes guianensis as a short-term fallow crop for improving upland rice productivity in northern Laos. Field Crops Research 2006. 96(2/3): p. 438-447.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Mycorrhizae''' – [[Mycorrhizae]] are similar to rhizobia in that they interact with plants at their roots. Whereas rhizobia are bacteria that fix nitrogen, mycorrhizae are fungi that bring nutrients to the plants in return for carbon. Mycorrhizas are also capable of improving water uptake and communicating to their hosts to resist to [[pathogens]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas H. Boucher, Sam James and Kathleen H. Keeler 
Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, Vol. 13, (1982), pp. 315–347&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of mycorrhizae exist: 
:# Arbuscula: found in non-woody and tropical plants
:# Ectomycorrhiza: found in boreal and temperate forests
:# Ericoid: found in species of the heathland.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

*'''Digestive symbiotes''' – Digestive symbyotes are an example of an important trophic mutualism that does not occur between an autotroph and heterotroph. Bacteria known as "extracellular symbionts"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; live within the [[gastrointestinal tracts]] of [[vertebrates]], where they aid in the digestion of food. The bacteria benefits by extracting [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] from the eaten food, while the animal’s [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] is increased by being able to digest certain foods that its natural system cannot. (book) In addition, these bacteria create [[short-chain fatty acids]] (SCFA), providing the vertebrate with energy totaling up to anywhere from 29%-79% of the vertebrate’s maintenance energy depending on the species.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, C.E. and I.D. Hume, Contributions of Microbes in Vertebrate Gastrointestinal Tract to Production and Conservation of Nutrients. Physiological Reviews, 1998. 72(2): p. 383-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of research==

Ecologists first began to understand trophic mutualisms in the mid-20th century with the investigation of nutrient abundance and distribution. One of the first trophic mutualisms was discovered in 1958 by Professor Leonard Muscatine of UCLA, the relationship between endozoic algae and coral.&lt;ref&gt;Hoegh-Guldberg, O., et al., Len Muscatine (1932–2007) and his contributions
to the understanding of algal-invertebrate endosymbiosis. Coral Reefs, 2007. 26(4): pp. 731–739.&lt;/ref&gt; In this relationship, the algae provides the coral with a Carbon source to develop its CaCO&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; skeleton and the coral secretes a protecting nutrient-rich mucus which benefits the algae. Perhaps one of the most famous discoveries made by Muscatine in the field of trophic mutualism came about 10 years later in another aquatic based system-the relationship between algae and water hydra.&lt;ref&gt;Muscatine, Leonard, and Howard Lenhoff. "Symbiosis: On the Role of Algae Symbiotic with Hydra." Science 142 (19681): 956-58.e&lt;/ref&gt; This work was significant in establishing the presence of mutualistic relationships in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

Perhaps the most widely acclaimed example of a trophic mutualism was the discovery of the [[leafcutter ant]] that engage in trophic mutualism with a fungus.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Neal A.  1972.  Gardening Ants the Attines.  The American Philosophical 
Society.  Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;  These ants cultivate a certain type of fungus by providing it with leaves and other nutrients. In turn, the ants will feed on a special nutrient that is only created by the fungus they nurture. This trophic mutualism was studied in detail in the 1970s and since.

'''''Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible''''' is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] to the [[Bible]] compiled by [[Robert Young (biblical scholar)|Robert Young]] first published in 1879.

==Contents==
* ''Hints and Helps to Bible Interpretation'' (only in some later editions)
* ''Analytical Concordance'' - Each entry can contain the multiple original language words in the original language and in a phonetic vocalization into English. It also gives the extended meaning and usage of the word in the original language. This is a "[[Bible concordance]]" to the [[King James Version|King James Version (KJV)]] and not a [[lexicon]] of the [[Biblical Hebrew|OT Hebrew]] or [[Koine|NT Greek]] languages.
* ''Index lexicons to the Old and New Testaments, being a guide to parallel passages'' prepared by Wm. B. Stevenson.
* The British eighth edition also includes ''A complete list of Scripture Proper Names as in the Authorised and Revised Versions, showing their modern pronunciation and the exact form of the original Hebrew'' by the same author. This appendix also has an informative introduction.

==Editions==
British editions and American editions are numbered differently.

===British editions===
These have the title ''Analytical Concordance to the Holy Bible''.
* First published 1879, followed by editions 2&amp;ndash;6.
* Seventh edition published 1900, revised throughout by the Glasgow [[Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages]], [[William Barron Stevenson]] (1869-1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1426&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of William Barron Stevenson|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:This was reprinted 1904, 1905, 1906, 1909, 1912. 
:1913 was the first to be published by the [[Religious Tract Society]];&lt;ref&gt;Known from 1931 as the United Society for Christian Literature, [[Lutterworth Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reprinted 1919, 1922, 1924, 1927, 1933, 1935.
* Eighth edition published 1938, revised further by J. H. Young with advice from Stevenson.
:This was reprinted 1939, 1943, 1946, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961, ..., 1971, 1973, 1977, ...

===American editions===
:''This section is incomplete''.
These have the title ''Analytical Concordance to the Bible''.

The 20th American edition, first published in 1910, corresponds largely to the British 7th edition revised by W. B. Stevenson, but to which was added a further supplement, entitled ''A sketch of recent exploration in Bible lands'' by Thomas Nicol. This was originally published separately some time before its second edition which appeared in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recent-Explorations-Bible-Lands-Thomas/dp/B002IBADT2/|title=Recent Explorations in Bible Lands / by Thomas Nicol|last=Nicol|first=Thomas|date=1893|publisher=Edinburgh : George Adam Young|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later editions include a supplement entitled ''The Canon of Scripture'' by [[R. K. Harrison]] and Everett F. Harrison.
