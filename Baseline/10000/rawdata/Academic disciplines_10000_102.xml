The '''African Gender Institute''' (AGI) is a [[feminist]] research and teaching group that studies [[gender studies|issues related to gender]] in Africa. It has become a department at the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), administered within the School of African and Gender Studies, Social Anthropology and Linguistics. The AGI has its own dedicated staff and has a unique degree of independence from UCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02610151211235505 |title=Reflections on being a feminist academic/academic feminism in South Africa |year=2012 |last1=Gouws |first1=Amanda |journal=Equality, Diversity and Inclusion |volume=31 |issue=5/6 |pages=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The AGI describes itself as specifically feminist and seeks to promote [[feminism]] on the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agi.ac.za/mission-and-vision |title=Mission and Vision |publisher=African Gender Institute |quote=Powerfully feminist in philosophy and practice the AGI offers programmes of teaching and research on gender in the contexts of, inter alia, sexuality, development, land reform, law, conflict, politics, race, economics and culture. |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AGI serves as a point of contact for feminist intellectuals across Africa, many of whom suffer from isolation and discrimination at their academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sylvia Tamale]], profiled in: Gretchen L. Wilson, "African Female Scholars Share Virtual Lifeline", ''Women's eNews'' on ''WorldPress'', 21 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amina Mama]]—a key figure at the AGI—has argued that the organization constitutes a key exception to [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] commodification of and control over African academics.&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW interview"&gt;Amina Mama interviewed by Elaine Salo, "Talking about Feminism in Africa", reproduced in ''Women's World'' from ''Agenda'', "African Feminisms I", no. 50 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; A major goal of the AGI is to maintain an institutional space for African feminists to network, collaborate, teach, and research.&lt;ref name="Mama 2011"/&gt;

==History==
The AGI grew out of the Equal Opportunities Research Project, created at the University of Cape Town in 1992 as [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] was ending. The AGI was created in 1996, with the specific goal of advocating for women researchers, policy advocates and writers based within African countries, and with commitment to the growth and voice of African feminisms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agi.ac.za/about/history |title=History |publisher=African Gender Institute |quote=Powerfully feminist in philosophy and practice the AGI offers programmes of teaching and research on gender in the contexts of, inter alia, sexuality, development, land reform, law, conflict, politics, race, economics and culture. |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mama became director of the AGI in 2000 and helped to found its journal ''[[Feminist Africa]]''.&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=200759 |title=One-way ticket just isn't an option |author=Karen MacGregor |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |accessdate=2012-12-16 |date=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mama's leadership, projects in women's access to e-technologies, women's peace activism, sexual and reproductive rights, and projects on citizenship were undertaken, with contributors across the continent. Key amoing these were Elaine Salo, Sisonke Msimang, Jane Bennett, [[Jennifer Radloff]], and Yaliwe Clarke in South Africa, [[Charmaine Pereira]] in Nigeria, Sylvia Tamale and Ruth Ochieng in Uganda, Takyiwaa Manuh and Akosua Ampofo in Ghana, and many others. The AGI also grew a strong undergraduate and graduate teaching and research programme within the university of Cape Town.

Faced with budget cuts andshifting institutional support, the AGI found itself split from the project of Gender Studies at UCT. The AGI, under the directorship of Jane Bennett from 2008 to 2017, focused on consolidating its core intellectual positions and its institutional position at UCT, and continued to run successful projects, especially in sexuality and reproductive justice work. These efforts were generally successful, and in 2017, Yaliwe Clarke took over the directorship of the AGI with new agendas for strengthening black, queer and African work especially among young women. This was strongly supported by a new Advisory Board &lt;ref name="intellectuals"&gt;Amina Mama, "Gender studies for Africa's transformation", in ''African Intellectuals: Rethinking Politics, Language, Gender and Development'', ed. Thandika Mkandawire, London: Zed Books and [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|CODESRIA]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[File:Uct open day 035.jpg|thumb|300px|High school students check out the African Gender Institute during a UCT open day]]
Gender and Women's Studies for Africa's Transformation, or GWS Africa, is one of AGI's major projects. GWS Africa is an effort aimed at creating and sharing a strong intellectual core for feminists across Africa. Much of GWS Africa takes place online, through a listserv and a website. The organization generated ''Feminist Africa'', which mostly circulates online.&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt; Through GWS Africa, the AGI has been a major force for increasing women's access to internet communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hafkin, Nancy J. |chapter=Convergence of Concepts: Gender and ICTs in Africa |editor1=Adera, Edith Ofwona |editor2=Rathgeber, Eva-Maria |title=Gender and the information revolution in Africa |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-88936-903-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000–2002, GWS Africa conducted a survey of Gender and/or Women's Studies Departments across Africa. It found that these disciplines were generally on the rise, but that many of them had adopted the mainstream [[Women in Development]] (WID) approach. This finding reinforced the AGI's desire to foster a more critical African feminist discourse, and led in 2002 to a significant pan-African feminist forum in 2002, held at UCT.&lt;ref name="Mama 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/conf-proceedings/n1s/full/fr201122a.html |title=What does it mean to do feminist research in African contexts |author=Amina Mama |journal=Feminist Theory &amp; Activism in Global Perspective: Feminist Review Conference Proceedings |pages=e4–e20 |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 on, the AGI's work on strengthening gender studies and feminist work on the continent grew in multiple directions, including the creation of a Southern Africa-wide network on sexual harassment in higher education, the growth of feminist-oriented e-space specifically designed for the interest of African-based feminists, the regular publication of ''Feminist Africa'', and many capacity-building workshops on questions of land, movement building, militarism and sexuality.

From 2008 on, under the new directorship of Jane Bennett, programmes on sexuality and reproductive justice were strengthened while other AGI threads were simultaneously developed by a very strong team, including Yaliwe Clarke working on women's peace activism with Ruth Ochieng of ISIS-Wicce in Uganda.The teaching programmes within the University of Cape Town grew strongly, and partnerships were built with [[Barnard College]] in New York, the Gino Germani Institute in Buenos Aires, and [[CODESRIA]] in Senegal. E-advocacy projects were built by Selina Mudavanhu, and others.

In 2012, the University of Cape Town instituted a merger process which split the AGI's public project work from its gender studies teaching, creating a new section of Gender Studies. This had challenging impacts, but the AGI continued to stabilize itself with new programmes in young women's leadership in sexuality. 

In 2017, under new directorship again, with Yaliwe Clarke, the AGI ran programmes in queer visuality, with film festivals in different locations, and initiated work on a symposium entitled "Dreaming the Future," to celebrate the work of acclaimed South Arican feminist, Pumla Gqola.

==History==

===Dropsie College===
The institution now known as the Katz Center was founded in 1907 as the '''Dropsie College of Hebrew and Cognate Learning''' and finally as '''Dropsie University'''.  It was named after its benefactor, Moses Aaron Dropsie (1821–1905),&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5331-dropsie-moses-aaron "Dropsie, Moses Aaron"] ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587505418/dropsie-moses-aaron.html "Dropsie, Moses Aaron"] ''Encyclopedia.com'' website&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy man whose father was Jewish and mother was Christian but who self-identified as Jewish from the age of 14. Dropsie willed his entire fortune to "the promotion of and instruction in the Hebrew and cognate languages and their respective literatures."

Dropsie granted more than 200 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s between its inception and its closing as a degree-granting institution in 1986.  Dropsie was also the publisher of the ''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', which was at the time the most respected journal on the subject.

The faculty during the Dropsie era included scholars from outside the United States, including [[Benzion Netanyahu]], who came from [[Jerusalem]] with his young sons, [[Yonatan Netanyahu|Yonatan (Yoni)]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Benjamin (Bibi)]], who there had their first true exposures to American culture, which would become a touchstone for later interactions with the American public for Bibi.&lt;ref name=Moyer /&gt;

===Recent history===
Although no longer a degree-granting college, it became the '''Annenberg Research Institute''' after its 1986 closing and turned into one of the country's most noted interdisciplinary post-doctoral fellowship programs. It merged with the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, after which the institution was renamed the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.  It continues to publish the ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', the oldest continuously published Judaic studies [[Academic journal|journal]] in English.

==Fellowships==
Today, CAJS supports approximately 24 [[fellow]]s each year who conduct their research at the University of Pennsylvania.  Each fellow is given their own downtown Philadelphia office and meets with the others at weekly [[seminar]]s.  The [[Academic paper|papers]] they produce are published by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]] at the conclusion of their term in the program.

Each year has a specific theme; scholars apply if their current research fits the annual theme. For example, for the 2005-2006 [[Academic term|academic year]], the theme was "The Jewish Book: Materials Texts and Comparative Contexts."  For 2006-2007, fellows studied "Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Life under Caliphs and Sultans."

==Library==
The combination of the Dropsie/Annenberg library along with the University of Pennsylvania's resulted in a 350,000-volume collection on Judaica, including more than 8,000 rare books and an assortment of [[cuneiform]] tablets.  Texts are available to scholars in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Library Legacy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiron|first=Arthur|title=The Professionalization of Wisdom: The Legacy of Dropsie College and Its Library|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/at250/dropsie/ak.pdf|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|pages=20|format=PDF|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also 451 [[codices]] in eleven [[alphabet]]s and 24 languages and [[dialect]]s.   Some of the languages and dialects represented, in addition to those already listed, include [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judeo-Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].  Fragments from the [[Cairo Genizah]] and others written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] on [[papyrus]] round out the collection.&lt;ref name="Library Legacy" /&gt;

The library also holds the personal letters of more than 50 [[Jewish American|Jewish-American]] leaders from the 1800s and 1900s, including [[Isaac Leeser]], [[Sabato Morais]], &amp; Abraham Neuman (three ministers of [[Congregation Mikveh Israel (Philadelphia)]]), [[Cyrus Adler]] (president: Dropsie College, Mikveh Israel, [[American Jewish Committee]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], librarian: [[Smithsonian Institution]]), Charles Cohen (president: Mikveh Israel, [[Fairmount Park]] Commission), his journalist sister Mary M. Cohen, Yiddish journalist Ben Zion Goldberg, and the benefactor Dropsie.&lt;ref name="Library Legacy" /&gt;

The '''UCD Center for Mind and Brain''' is a [[research]] and [[training]] unit at the [[University of California, Davis]] dedicated to understanding the nature of the [[human mind]] from interdisciplinary perspectives.

Scientists currently in the CMB (19 core members), and those who will be recruited to join it, include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how our minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]), [[biological science]] ([[behavioral neuroscience|behavioral]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[physiology]]), [[engineering science]] ([[biomedical]] and [[electrical engineering]], [[computer science]]), and [[medical science]] ([[neurology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[medical imaging]]).

The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the [[brain]]? Scientists in the CMB study language, memory, attention, cognitive control, emotion, multi-sensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants, children, and adults, and in special patient populations. We are also a leader in the emerging field of translational cognitive neuroscience, which endeavors to translate basic science findings about the operation of healthy minds and brains into clinical research on mind-[[brain disorder]]s such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[attention deficit disorder]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2314">The '''City Statute''' (Law 10.257) is a federal law passed in [[Brazil]] in 2001 that builds on the [[Constitution of Brazil | Federal Constitution of Brazil]] to create a new legal-urban order to provide land access and equity in large urban cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The City Statute: A Commentary|year=2010|publisher=Cities Alliance and Ministry of Cities|location=Sao Paulo, Brazil|pages=120|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CA_Images/CityStatuteofBrazil_Eng_ForewordandTOC.pdf The City Statute of Brazil: A commentary], ''The Cities Alliance'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is premised on the idea of the [[Right to the city]] and emerged as a result of many years of popular struggle.&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"&gt;[http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/polis-blog/30417/implementing-right-city-brazil "Implementing the Right to the City in Brazil?"], ''Sustainable Cities Collective'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two main functions. The first is to ensure that the 'social function' of urban land and buildings is put before their commercial value. This has been defined as "the prioritization of [[use value]] over exchange value".&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"/&gt; The second is to ensure 'democratic city management'. This has been defined as "a path to plan, produce, operate and govern cities subject to social control and participation."&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"/&gt;

==Critiques==
It has been argued that, although the legislation is pro-poor, elite actors have been able to use their power to operate in a manner that still privileges elite interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepolisblog.org/2012/01/misusing-city-statute-in-sao-paulo.html Misusing the City Statute in São Paulo], Patricia Rodrigues Samora, ''Polis'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="895">A '''cut-out score''' or '''cutout score''' is a [[Sheet music|musical score]] in which measures with [[rest (music)|rests]] are simply omitted, and no rests of any kind are used. Cut-out scores are mostly used for proportional notation scores, such as Penderecki's ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]''. "Proponents of this arrangement argue that it dispenses with needless clutter on the score page," while "others maintain that not enough is gained by this format to justify the extra effort in setting up the score."&lt;ref&gt;Kennan &amp; Grantham (1990): 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut-out scores can be created with any full-featured [[scorewriter]], such as Finale or Sibelius. Instead of extracting parts, all the players are given the score.

The Diplomacy Academy is the institute in charge of diplomatic training and academic collaboration operations of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey]]. The Academy was originally established as Foreign Affairs Academy in 1968, was later renamed to Training Center in 1994, and eventually took its current designation, "Diplomacy Academy" under the 2010 legal overhaul that redesigned Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey and gave the Academy a larger spectrum of tasks, including:&lt;ref&gt;http://diab.mfa.gov.tr/en/about/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20th International Junior Diplomats Training Program.JPG|thumb|20th International Junior Diplomats Training Program]]

* train Ministry officers of every service category and rank, including Consuls General and Ambassadors,
* plan and organize attendance to internship and training programs,
* coordinate exchange of diplomats with other Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
* execute training programs for foreign diplomats, including International Junior Diplomats Training Program.
* collaborate with other Diplomatic Academies,
* plan and organize foreign service orientation program for officials from other Turkish government institutions due for overseas posting,
* hold foreign policy and protocol seminars for foreign relations departments of other Turkish government institutes.

International Junior Diplomats Training Program is the Academy's biggest annual undertaking. It has been held every year since 1992, and diplomats from all over the globe are invited for a one-month program covering an overview of Turkish foreign policy, introduction to Turkish history and art, and visits to touristic and cultural spotlights including Cappadocia, Nevşehir, and landmarks of Istanbul

The Diplomacy Academy is headed by the office of Director, currently held by Assoc. Prof. Mesut Özcan.&lt;ref&gt;http://diab.mfa.gov.tr/en/about/message-from-the-chairman/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14096">'''Disinfection by-products''' (DBPs) result from [[chemical reaction]]s between organic and inorganic matter in water with chemical treatment agents during the [[water disinfection]] process.&lt;ref name=Richardson07&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.09.001 |title=Occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in drinking water: A review and roadmap for research |year=2007 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Plewa |first2=Michael J. |last3=Wagner |first3=Elizabeth D. |last4=Schoeny |first4=Rita |last5=DeMarini |first5=David M. |journal=Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research |volume=636 |pages=178–242 |pmid=17980649 |issue=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chlorination disinfection byproducts ==
Chlorinated [[disinfectant|disinfection agents]] such as [[chlorine]] and [[chloramine]] are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s introduced into water in order to destroy [[pathogenic]] microbes, to oxidize taste/odor-forming compounds, and to form a [[disinfectant residual]] so water can reach the consumer tap safe from microbial contamination. These disinfectants may react with naturally present [[fulvic acid|fulvic]] and [[humic acid|humic]] acids, amino acids, and other natural organic matter, as well as iodide and bromide ions, to produce a range of DBPs such as the [[trihalomethanes]] (THMs), [[haloacetic acids]] (HAAs), [[bromate]], and [[chlorite]] (which are regulated in the US), and so-called "emerging" DBPs such as [[nitromethane|halonitromethanes]], [[acetonitrile|haloacetonitriles]], [[haloamide]]s, [[furanone|halofuranones]], [[iodo-acid]]s such as [[iodoacetic acid]], iodo-THMs ([[iodotrihalomethanes]]), [[nitrosamine]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

Chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the US, and it has been found to produce [[N-Nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA), which is a possible human carcinogen, as well as highly [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] iodinated DBPs, such as [[iodoacetic acid]], when iodide is present in source waters.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/es801169k |title= Occurrence and Mammalian Cell Toxicity of Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in Drinking Water |year=2008 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Fasano |first2=Francesca |last3=Ellington |first3=J.

Residual chlorine and other disinfectants may also react further within the distribution network — both by further reactions with dissolved natural organic matter and with biofilms present in the pipes. In addition to being highly influenced by the types of organic and inorganic matter in the source water, the different species and concentrations of DBPs vary according to the type of disinfectant used, the dose of disinfectant, the concentration of natural organic matter and bromide/iodide, the time since dosing (i.e. water age), temperature, and pH of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=81–90 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.1997.12.2.81 |title=Drinking Water Chlorination By-Products And Cancer |year=1997 |last1=Koivusalo, |first1=Meri |last2=Vartiainen |first2=Terttu |journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |volume=12 |issue=2 |pmid=9273924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming pools using chlorine have been found to contain trihalomethanes, although generally they are below current EU standard for drinking water (100 micrograms per litre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=586–99 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500139 |title=Uptake of chlorination disinfection by-products; a review and a discussion of its implications for exposure assessment in epidemiological studies |year=2000 |last1=Nieuwenhuijsen |first1=Mark J. |last2=Toledano |first2=Mireille B. |last3=Elliott |first3=Paul |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=10 |issue=6 |pmid=11140442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of trihalomethanes (mainly [[chloroform]]) of up to 0.43 ppm have been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beech |first1=J.

Trichloramine is formed by the reaction of urea (from urine and sweat) with chlorine and gives the indoor swimming pool its distinctive odor.

==Byproducts from non-chlorinated disinfectants==
Several powerful oxidizing agents are used in disinfecting and treating drinking water, and many of these also cause the formation of DBPs. [[Ozone]], for example, produces ketones, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes, including formaldehyde.  Bromide in source waters can be converted by ozone into [[bromate]], a potent carcinogen that is regulated in the United States, as well as other brominated DBPs.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt; 

As regulations are tightened on established DBPs such as THMs and HAAs, drinking water treatment plants may switch to alternative disinfection methods. This change will alter the distribution of classes of DBP's.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

==Occurrence==
DBPs are present in most drinking water supplies that have been subject to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[chloramination]], ozonation, or treatment with chlorine dioxide. Many hundreds of DBPs exist in treated drinking water and at least 600 have been identified.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Richardson |first=Susan D. | editor-last =Nriagu | editor-first =J.O. |title=Disinfection By-Products: Formation and Occurrence of Drinking Water |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environmental Health |volume=2 | pages=110–13| publisher=Burlington Elsevier | year=2011 |isbn=978-0-444-52273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low levels of many of these DBPs, coupled with the analytical costs in testing water samples for them, means that in practice only a handful of DBPs are actually monitored. Increasingly it is recognized that the genotoxicities and cytotoxicities of many of the DBPs not subject to regulatory monitoring, (particularly iodinated, nitrogenous DBPs) are comparatively much higher than those DBPs commonly monitored in the developed world (THMs and HAAs).&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=955–61 |doi=10.1021/es071754h |title=Occurrence, Synthesis, and Mammalian Cell Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of Haloacetamides: An Emerging Class of Nitrogenous Drinking Water Disinfection Byproducts |year=2008 |last1=Plewa |first1=Michael J. |last2=Muellner |first2=Mark G. |last3=Richardson |first3=Susan D. |last4=Fasano |first4=Francesca |last5=Buettner |first5=Katherine M. |last6=Woo |first6=Yin-Tak |last7=McKague |first7=A. Bruce |last8=Wagner |first8=Elizabeth D. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=42 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
Epidemiological studies have looked at the associations between exposure to DBPs in drinking water with cancers, adverse birth outcomes and birth defects. Meta-analyses and pooled analyses of these studies have demonstrated consistent associations for bladder cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=148–56 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwj364 |title=Bladder Cancer and Exposure to Water Disinfection By-Products through Ingestion, Bathing, Showering, and Swimming in Pools |year=2006 |last1=Villanueva |first1=C.

'''Egypt Nanotechnology Center''' (EGNC) ([[Arabic]]: مركز مصر للنانو تكنولوجي) is the joint result of partnership agreement between the Egyptian [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)]] represented by [[Information Technology Industry Development Agency]] (ITIDA), Egyptian [[Ministry of Higher Education]] represented by [[Cairo University]] and Egyptian [[Ministry of Scientific Research]] represented by the [[Science and Technological Development Fund]] (SCID).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itida.gov.eg/En/OurPrograms/ResearchInnovation/Nanotechnology/Pages/default.aspx#&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a state of art initiative launched by the Egyptian government in 2008 to support industrial research novelty.

== History ==
The center was proposed by the Egyptian government in 2008 and planning for the centre was based on a memorandum of understanding signed in September 2008 between the development agency, on behalf of the Egyptian [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)]], SCID and IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090724101625342|title=EGYPT: First nanotechnology centre to boost research - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of human capital started by sending 10 Egyptian researchers to gain industrial R&amp;D experience in [[IBM]]’s research labs in [[Yorktown Heights]] and [[Zurich]]. During their post, they work in collaboration with [[IBM]]’s scientists on five main projects. [[Cairo University]] and [[Nile University]] were the founding academic partners of EGNC, and additional academic partners have been such as [[Mansoura University]], and the [[Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology]].
The center has 44 patents and published 25 researches in international scientific periodicals of nanotechnology applications in the period between 2009 and 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cu.edu.eg/Cairo-University-News-3090.html|title=First Phase of Nanotechnology Center at Cairo University - Cairo University|last=University|first=Cairo|website=cu.edu.eg|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims and Vision ==
This state of the art research center will contribute to the growth of the national economy through the development of human capital, the production of valuable intellectual property and the promotion of nanotechnology applications in all sectors that are relevant to the economic development of Egypt. The aim of the Center is to build and strengthen applied and industrial research and its infrastructure in the areas of greatest strategic value to Egypt’s long-term competitiveness and development. The center also aims at making the Egyptian economy become among the top 10 in the world in terms of the relative growth resulting from the development and application of nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itida.gov.eg/En/OurPrograms/ResearchInnovation/Nanotechnology/Pages/default.aspx#&lt;/ref&gt;

A not-for-profit organisation, the '''European Language Resources Association''' ("ELRA") is established under the law of the Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]].  Its seat is in Luxembourg and its headquarters in [[Paris]] (France).

==Activities==
Since its foundation in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/1250_Paper.pdf Khalid Choukri, Valérie Mapelli, Hélène Mazo and Vladimir Popescu,  	LR Infrastructures and Architectures, LR National/International Projects, Infrastructural/Policy issues]&lt;/ref&gt; the European Language Resources Association has been a conduit for the '''distribution''' of speech, written and terminology Language Resources (LRs) for the Human [[Language Technology]] (HLT), a key compound of [[Information Society Technologies|IST]]. In order to do so, a number of technical and logistic, commercial (prices, fees, royalties), legal ([[License|licensing]], [[Intellectual Property]] Rights, Management), and information dissemination issues had to be addressed. Since its foundation, ELRA's mission has enlarged slightly, broadening its objectives and responsibilities towards the HLT community. ELRA is also involved in the '''production''', or commissioning of the production, of language resources through a number of initiatives, also actively committed to the '''evaluation''' of language engineering tools as well as to the '''identification''' of new resources. The set up of the identification number [[ISLRN]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/1251_Paper.pdf Valérie Mapelli, Vladimir Popescu, Lin Liu and Khalid Choukri,	Language Resource Citation: the ISLRN Dissemination and Further Developments]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by NLP12 in 2013, is the most recent initiative led by ELDA to enhance the identification of Language Resources and their citation in publications.
Finally, every other year, ELRA organizes a major conference [[LREC]], the International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

==Mission==
The mission of the Association is to promote language resources and evaluation for the Human Language Technology sector in all their forms and their uses, in a [[Europe]]an context. Consequently, the goals are: to coordinate and carry out identification, production, validation, distribution, standardisation of languages resources, as well as support for evaluation of systems, products, tools, etc. Information Dissemination is also part of ELRA's missions which is carried through both the organisation of the conference [[LREC]] and the Language Resources and Evaluation Journal&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/journal/10579 Language Resources and Evaluation Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Springer.

==ELRA Board==

'''European Pathway to Zero Waste''' is an EU demonstration project part funded by [[The LIFE Programme]] (LIFE+), the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and is a partnership between the [[Environment Agency]] and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). The project has been set up to investigate practical ways to achieve zero waste to landfill in the South East of England. It will share the results with colleagues both in the UK and in relevant EU Member States. Zero waste in this context is an approach to supporting the sustainable use of resources by business to benefit both the economy and the environment. It concentrates on reducing, re-using, recycling and recovering energy from waste. The project will run to March 2013.

{{short description|Termination of a taxon by the death of the last member}}
{{Conservation status}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''extinction''' is the termination of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences

Through [[evolution]], species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann {{ISBN|0-434-22610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|The [[dodo]] of [[Mauritius]], shown here in a 1626 illustration by [[Roelant Savery]], is an often-cited example of [[Holocene extinction|modern extinction]]&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] | publisher = [[W.

Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed ([[anagenesis]]) into a successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Michael |last2=Mulligan |first2=Pamela |last3=Stansfield |first3=William |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or split into more than one ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leighton |first=Lindsey R. |title=Taxon Characteristics That Promote Survivorship Through the Permian-Triassic Interval: Transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic Brachiopod Fauna  |journal=Paleobiology |date=2009 |volume=34 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1666/06082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===
{{Main|Lazarus taxa}}
The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.&lt;ref name="dinofish"&gt;[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt; A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt;

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover – John R.

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVLEV64qYfcC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-03-12|isbn = 9781444308938|language = en|first = L. Scott|last = Mills|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&amp;nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref name="Raup"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J.

When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences.

Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.&lt;ref name="IUCNno"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[World Conservation Union]] | url = http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20080113030317/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/red_list_2004/GSAexecsumm_EN.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 13, 2008 | title = 2004 Red List | work = IUCN Red List of Threatened Species | accessdate = September 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===
{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion|Mutational meltdown}}
If [[adaptation]] increasing population [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious [[mutation]]s, then a population will go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=J|last2=Gomez|first2=K|last3=Masel|first3=J|title=Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with population genetics|journal=Evolution|date=February 2017|volume=71|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1111/evo.13116|arxiv=1605.08717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to [[fixation (population genetics)|fix]] in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause [[mutational meltdown]].

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, J.L.  |author2=S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506–11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565|bibcode = 2007PNAS..10410506P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects [[evolvability]], including [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]]. A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent.

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating. Survey is now 20+ years old.  --&gt; of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;[[American Museum of Natural History]].

In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 25 July 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi=10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode= | last1 = Vignieri | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O.

For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a [[species]] was incompatible with the prevailing worldview.

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7LriV7aZpkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=hooke+nautilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWXg0qsaJ8&amp;sig=vUkaTNuCy8Ud9RjliZubXBdD4bM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6rGQptXTAhUF2IMKHfamAc8Q6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=hooke%20nautilus&amp;f=false|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005-05-03|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=9781596921153|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; While he contended that  it was possible a species could be "lost", he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912273245|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521819288|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart|Alexandre Bronigniart]] &amp; [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45730036|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M.

In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898833548|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520058309|oclc=898833548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He similarly argued against [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]], could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name="Kotzman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. Cormack Gates |author2=Curtis H. Freese |author3=Peter J.P. Gogan |author4=Mandy Kotzman |title=American bison: status survey and conservation guidelines 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koUrGx-i2ucC&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=6 November 2011|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-8317-1149-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name="INCHEM"&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

Retrieved September 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biogeography|Biogeographer]] [[Jared Diamond]] notes that while [[big business]] may label environmental concerns as "exaggerated", and often cause "devastating damage", some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by [[national park]]s.&lt;ref name="DiamondCollapse"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = Collapse | publisher = Penguin | year = 2005| isbn = 0-670-03337-5 | pages=15–17 |chapter=A Tale of Two Farms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to [[ecotourism]],&lt;ref name="Drewry"&gt;Drewry, Rachel. "[http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit51/orang.htm Ecotourism: Can it save the orangutans?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216200744/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit51/orang.htm |date=February 16, 2007 }}" ''Inside Indonesia''.

[[Nature preserve]]s are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] has resulted in international [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that "we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal." He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benatar|first=David|date=2008 |title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197 |isbn=978-0199549269|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans –- that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', a parasitic worm which causes the disease [[dracunculiasis]], is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the [[Carter Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3680439/guinea-worm-almost-extinct/ |title=This Species is Close to Extinction and That's a Good Thing |date=23 January 2015 |publisher=Time |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".&lt;ref name="Judson"/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''. Wilson stated, "I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it's just common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-04/why-famous-biologist-wants-eradicate-killer-mosquitoes| title=Why a famous biologist wants to eradicate killer mosquitoes|publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]], believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

"This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gray|first2=Roger|last2=Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genre fiction''', also known as '''popular fiction''', is a term used in the book-trade for [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specifically [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewArticle.asp?id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Genre fiction is generally distinguished from [[literary fiction]], a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]], publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]], and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by [[André Gide]] as "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney. http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-09-10/features/8903020475_1_inspector-maigret-georges-simenon-detective-story&lt;/ref&gt;

The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Genre and the marketing of fiction==

In the publishing industry the term "category fiction" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as [[Western fiction|Western]] or mystery.

The uncategorized section is known in the industry as "general fiction", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Adult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public,&lt;ref name=wollheim200606&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/06Wollheim.html|title=Locus Online: Betsy Wollheim interview excerpts|magazine=Locus |date=June 2006 | access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Stephanie|title=Forget 'serious' novels, I've turned to a life of crime|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=STASIO|first=MARILYN|title=Next Victim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Stasio-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=KAKUTANI|first=MICHIKO|title=Critic's Notebook; Kill!

Though a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

==History of genres==
{{See also|History of fantasy|History of science fiction}}
[[Genre]] began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Poetry]], [[prose]], and [[drama]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story.  Among the genres were the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in poetry and [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] for plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hadas, Moses (1950). ''A History of Greek Literature''. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods other genres such as the [[chivalric romance]], [[opera]], and [[prose fiction]] developed.

Though the [[novel]] is often seen as a modern genre, [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web|title=Literary critic Ian Watt dies after a long illness|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/99/991217watt.html|website=Stanford News Service|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been described as possessing "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", from the time of both [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p. 1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "romance" is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romance]]s of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.xxv-xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its "romance" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the [[mass-marketing]] of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the [[gothic novel]], [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[adventure novel]], [[historical romance]], and the [[detective novel]]. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction [[romance novel]]s in [[literary fiction]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, including [[Samuel Richardson]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and the novels of [[Jane Austen]] such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813).&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Regis, ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The genres==
{{mainlist|List of literary genres}}
The following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:

===Crime===
{{Main article|Crime fiction|Detective fiction}}
Crime fiction is the [[literary genre]] that fictionalises [[crime]]s, their detection, criminals, and their [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is usually distinguished from [[Literary fiction|mainstream]] fiction and other genres such as [[historical fiction]] or [[science fiction]], but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple [[subgenres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=990082541924074;res=IELAPA|title = May I Suggest Murder?: An Overview of Crime Fiction for Readers' Advisory Services Staff|last = Franks|first = Rachel|date = 2011|journal = Australian Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|volume = 60|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[detective fiction]] (such as the [[whodunit]]), [[courtroom drama]], [[hardboiled|hard-boiled]] fiction, [[mystery fiction]], and [[legal thriller]]s. [[Suspense]] and mystery are key elements to the genre.

===Fantasy===
{{Main article|Fantasy|History of fantasy|Fantasy literature}}
[[Fantasy]] is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] that uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or other [[supernatural]] elements as a main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element, [[Theme (literature)|theme]], or [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. Many works within the genre take place in [[imaginary world]]s where magic and [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]] are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of [[speculative fiction]]. In [[popular culture]], the fantasy genre predominantly features a [[Medievalism|medieval]]-type setting.

===Romance===
{{Main article|Romance novel}}
The [[romance novel]] or "romantic novel" primarily focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two&amp;nbsp;people, and must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web   | title = The Romance Genre Overview | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | url =http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=578  | accessdate = November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of the romance novel including [[fantasy]], [[Historical romance|historical]], [[science fiction]], same sex romantic fiction, and [[paranormal fiction]].

There is a [[literary fiction]] form of romance, which [[Walter Scott]] defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Romance Writers of America''{{'s}} data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582 Romance Writers of America]&lt;/ref&gt; the most important subgenres are: [[Category romance|Contemporary series romance]], [[Contemporary romance]], [[Historical romance]], [[Paranormal romance]], [[Romantic suspense]], [[Inspirational fiction|Inspirational romance]], Romantic suspense (series).
*Other: [[chick-lit]], [[erotic romance novels|erotic romance]], [[women's fiction]], [[Young Adult Romance Literature|Young adult romance]].

===Science fiction===
{{Main article|Science fiction}}
Science fiction is a [[genre]] of [[speculative fiction]] dealing with [[imagination|imaginative]] concepts such as [[future|futuristic]] [[science]] and [[technology]], [[spaceflight|space travel]], [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], [[faster than light travel]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] and [[extraterrestrial life]]. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other [[innovation]]s, and has been called a "literature of ideas".&lt;ref name="Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marg Gilks |author2=Paula Fleming |author3=Moira Allen | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas | work = | publisher =WritingWorld.com | year =2003 | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually eschews the [[supernatural]], and unlike the related genre of [[fantasy]], historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of [[science|science-based fact or theory]] at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506221319/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jenkins_mi.html |title=Media and Imagination: A Short History of American Science Fiction |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Misa |url=http://misabuckley.com/does-the-science-in-science-fiction-matter/ |title=Does the Science in Science Fiction Matter? |publisher=Misa Buckley |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western===
{{Main article|Western fiction}}
Western fiction is defined primarily by being set in the [[Western United States|American West]] in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen ([[cowboy]]s). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.

===Inspirational===
{{Main article|Inspirational fiction}}
Inspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes.  It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians.  Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.

===Horror===
{{Main article|Horror fiction}}
[[Horror fiction]] aims to frighten or disgust its readers.  Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required.  Early horror took much inspiration from [[Romanticism]] and [[Gothic fiction]].  Modern horror, such as [[cosmic horror]] and [[splatterpunk]], tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit.  Horror is often mixed with other genres.

==Critical appraisal and controversy==
Although frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with [[Stephen King]] being awarded the [[National Book Award|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]];&lt;ref name=natbook&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/amerletters.html "Distinguished Contribution to American Letters "], National Book Foundation, Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit.  Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Literary Revolution in the Supermarket Aisle: Genre Fiction Is Disruptive Technology|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/|work=Time|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[the Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Colin |title=King &amp; I: Stephen King and a Balanced Diet |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414150715/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]] described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. [[Graham Greene]] at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/03/biography.grahamgreene|title=More Sherry trifles|author=Ian Thomson|publisher=

Steensma|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[BBC]] defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=BBC denies 'sneering' at genre fiction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/21/bbc-genre-fiction?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Man Booker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Science fiction author hits out at Booker judges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/18/science-fiction-booker-prize|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Book Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=National Book Awards: Genre fiction dissed again|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/11/national_book_awards_genre_fiction_dissed_again/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. 

Some critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, K., Mullin, J.B., &amp; Mar, R.A. (2013). "What you read matters: The role of fiction genre in prediction interpersonal sensitivity". ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, And The Arts'', 7(4), 370-376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century British and Irish genre fiction==

{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[Sir John Barrow]]'s descriptive [[The Eventful History of the Mutiny and Piratical Seizure of HMS Bounty|1831 account]] of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] immortalised the Royal Navy ship {{HMS|Bounty}} and her people. The legend of [[Dick Turpin]] was popularised when the 18th-century English [[highwayman]]'s exploits appeared in the novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' in 1834.

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).

[[Penny dreadful]] publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous [[Sweeney Todd]]. The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' 1865, and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s "[[The Vampyre]]" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p.99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]], yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work ''[[Dracula]]'' and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire [[Count Dracula]], with the [[vampire hunter]] [[Abraham Van Helsing]] his arch-enemy. ''Dracula'' has been attributed to a number of [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].

[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' [[archenemy]] [[Professor Moriarty]], is widely considered to be the first true example of a [[supervillain]], while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr John H. Watson]].

The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novels]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' 1894, and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]'', 1898.

[[F. Anstey]]'s [[comic novel]] ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river [[Thames]]. Grossmith brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] &amp; [[Weedon Grossmith|Weedon]]'s ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.

==20th-century genre fiction==

===Early 20-century===
[[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]' ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' (1903), defined the [[spy novel]] and Follett has also called it "the first modern [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]".&lt;ref name=follett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ken-follett.com/suspense/index.html |title=The Art of Suspense |first=Ken |last=Follett |work=ken-follett.com |year=2016 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma Orczy]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the [[French Revolution]]ary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her "reckless daredevil" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|musical]] and other media. Baroness Orczy's character ''[[The Old Man in the Corner]]'' (1908) was among the earliest [[armchair detective]]s to be created. Her short stories about ''[[Lady Molly of Scotland Yard]]'' (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.

[[John Buchan]] wrote the [[adventure novel]]s on ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'' (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of [[Richard Hannay]], of which the first, ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the [[interwar period]], exemplified by the series of [[H. C. McNeile]] with ''[[Bulldog Drummond]]'' (1920), and [[Leslie Charteris]], whose many books chronicled the adventures of [[Simon Templar]], alias ''[[Simon Templar#Publishing history|The Saint]]''.

[[Image:Agatha Christie.png|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Agatha Christie]]]]

The [[medievalist]] scholar [[M. R. James]] wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.

This was called the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]]. [[Agatha Christie]], a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]], made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative [[twist ending]] had a significant impact on the genre), ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937) and ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939). Other female writers dubbed "Queens of crime" include [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] ([[gentleman detective]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]), [[Margery Allingham]] ([[Albert Campion]], supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/campion.htm|title=The Great Detectives: Albert Campion|work=Strand Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and New Zealander [[Ngaio Marsh]] ([[Roderick Alleyn]]). [[Georgette Heyer]] recreated the [[historical romance]] genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).

[[Image:Tolkien 1916.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]]]

A major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by Scottish writer [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]], first published in 1920. It combines [[fantasy]], philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm Book Review: A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) by David Lindsay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215000000/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |date=December 15, 2014 }} – Review by Paul M. Kieniewicz 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Space Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Lindskoog – [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=882 „A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower“].&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he read the book "with avidity", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookladysblog.com/2011/08/17/the-top-ten-books-that-influenced-j-r-r-tolkien/|title=thebookladysblog.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] in 1968.

From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal [[literary]] discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "[[Inklings]]". Its leading members were the major [[high fantasy|fantasy]] novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Lewis is known for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1950–1956) and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'' (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977).

===Later 20th-century===
In [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] writing, [[Ian Fleming]] created the character [[James Bond 007]] in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953), ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954), ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958), ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959), ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' (1961), ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1962), and nine short story works.

In contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, [[John le Carré]] was an author of [[spy fiction|spy novels]] who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. [[Frederick Forsyth]] writes thriller novels, including ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' (1971), ''[[The Odessa File]]'' (1972), ''[[The Dogs of War (novel)|The Dogs of War]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1984). [[Ken Follett]] writes spy thrillers, his first success being ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' (1978), followed by ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'' (1980), as well as historical novels, notably ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (1989), and its sequel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'' (2007). [[Elleston Trevor]] is remembered for his 1964 adventure story ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', while the thriller novelist [[A. J. Quinnell|Philip Nicholson]] is best known for ''[[Man on Fire (Quinnell novel)|Man on Fire]]''. [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958), is a Cold War thriller.

[[War novel]]s include [[Alistair MacLean]] thriller's ''[[The Guns of Navarone (novel)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1957), ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), and [[Jack Higgins]]' ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1975). [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[sea story|nautical]] historical novels feature the ''[[Aubrey–Maturin series]]'' set in the [[Royal Navy]], the first being ''[[Master and Commander]]'' (1969).

The "father of [[Wicca]]", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], began propagating his own version of [[witchcraft]] in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the [[New Forest coven]] in 1939, Gardner published his books ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. [[Ronald Welch]]'s [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] winning novel ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the [[Third Crusade]], featuring the Christian leader and King of England [[Richard the Lionheart]].

In crime fiction, the [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]] of [[Ruth Rendell]] and [[P. D. James]] are popular.

[[Nigel Tranter]] wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; [[Robert the Bruce]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#Robert the Bruce trilogy|The Bruce Trilogy]]'', and [[William Wallace]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#The Wallace|The Wallace]]'' (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.

====Science fiction====
[[Image:Clarke sm.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Arthur C. Clarke]]]]

[[John Wyndham]] wrote [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] science fiction, his most notable works being ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Midwich Cuckoos]]'' (1957).

The '''German Archaeological Institute''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut}}, ''DAI'') is an institution of research within the field of [[archaeology]] (and related fields),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/en/objectives?ft=all Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:33GMT&lt;/ref&gt; and  a "scientific corporation", under the auspices of the [[Federal Foreign Office|federal Foreign Office of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:26GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Startseite_node.html Federal Foreign Office] retrieved 12:47GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

[[Eduard Gerhard]] was the founder of the institute, according to the homepage of DAI. On the occasion of his leaving [[Rome]],  the headquarters of the then ''Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica'', established within Berlin in 1832,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/en/history?ft=all Deutsches Archäologisches Institut] retrieved 12:38GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt; from the institute previously founded by [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (archaeologist)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]], [[Theodor Panofka]] and [[August Kestner]] in 1829 in Rome.

There are offices in many other cities, currently including [[Madrid]], Rome, [[Istanbul]], [[Athens]], [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], [[Tehran]] and [[Sana'a]]. Its Romano-Germanic Commission (Römisch-Germanische Kommission), including the world's largest library for prehistoric archaeology, is located in [[Frankfurt]], its Commission for the History of [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]] in [[Munich]] and its Commission for the Archaeology of Non-European Cultures in [[Bonn]]. 

[[Hans-Joachim Gehrke]] was President of the Institute from March 2008 to April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hans-joachim-gehrke.de/?page_id=2  Timeline of Hans-Joachim Gehrke] retrieved 16:08GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;  succeeded by [[Friederike Fless]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/klassarch/mitarbeiter/professoren/fless.html Institut für Klassische Archäologie] retrieved 16:26GMT 2.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;

An important retired employee is [[Jutta Meischner]]. She retired after 35 years of service in the German Archeological Institute in 2000. During this time she continued her studies of late antique portraiture, which culminated in a brief monograph entitled "Portraits of Late Antiquity".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">The [[anti-trust]] [[class-action]] lawsuit '''Jung v. AAMC ''' alleged collusion to prevent American [[medical resident|trainee doctors]] from negotiating for better working conditions. The [[Medical resident work hours|working conditions of medical residents]] often involved 80- to 100-hour workweeks.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal anti-trust laws.

==Background==
Every year, American medical students and graduates participate along with foreign-trained physicians in a national matching plan to obtain a position in an accredited resident training program.  Applicants and programs that participate in the matching plan submit rank-ordered preferences for training.  A mathematical algorithm is used to place an applicant in a preferred program that also prefers the applicant.

The [[National Resident Matching Program]], also referred to as "The Match", is one of several national matching plans in the United States.

==Lawsuit==
The suit was launched on behalf of all current and former medical residents against defendants that oversaw and participated in the matching process as well as institutions that employed medical residents.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three physicians who launched the suit alleged that the [[National Resident Matching Program|NRMP Matching program]] was an [[anti-competitive practice]], claiming that:

* fourth-year medical students were required to apply to the Match, and had no opportunity to negotiate their terms of employment with teaching hospitals ''(if they did not apply, they could not enter a residency accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], and hence could not become certified as physicians by an [[American Board of Medical Specialties|ABMS-recognized board]], meaning that they cannot practice their specialty)''
* the defendants limited the number of residency positions available in U.S. teaching hospitals 
* the defendants placed "substantial obstacles to the ability of a resident to transfer employment from one employer to another during the period of a residency"
* the ACGME encouraged or required participation in the Match as a condition of accreditation for institutions offering residencies.
* the defendants shared information on conditions of employment, and reviewed them in order to keep salaries low.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants challenged the admissibility of the lawsuit with several arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction &lt;ref name=opinion&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2004419300FSupp2d119_1407/JUNG%20v.%20ASSOCIATION%20OF%20AMERICAN%20MEDICAL%20COLLEGES]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the plaintiffs had not been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S1546-1440(03)00007-3| issn = 1546-1440| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 40–47| last = Bierig| first = Jack R.| title = Jung v. Association Of American Medical Colleges: the lawsuit challenging our system of graduate medical education| journal = Journal of the American College of Radiology| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2004-01-01| url = http://www.jacr.org/article/S1546144003000073/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court dismissed the cases against two defendants for lack of jurisdiction, and three because the claims of conspiracy did not involve them. The federal district court did allow the case to proceed against 17 defendants, ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged a common agreement to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and compensation of resident physicians and to impose a scheme of restraints that has the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other terms of employment among certain defendants.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislative change==
The lawsuit ended when Congress enacted legislation as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] added to an unrelated bill (the [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004|Pension Funding Equity Act]]) that exempted participation in a matching program from federal anti-trust laws.

The rider was called "Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs" (Section 207). Neither the rider nor the then-ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. The rider was lobbied for by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and the [[American Hospital Association]], and sponsored by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] of New Hampshire and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; Senators [[Herb Kohl|Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold|Feingold]], and [[Jeff Bingaman|Bingaman]] publicly criticized the way in which the rider was added.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;

The rider praised the 50-year-old Matching Program, saying that "[a]ntitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long standing process" and  "would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research"&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The bill containing the rider was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 8, 2004.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The new law prohibited  "using allegations related to the Match to support any antitrust claim",&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; retroactively.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; The court ruled that the plaintiff's case was dependent on allegations related to the Match.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; The case was dismissed under the authority of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">A '''Legist''', from the Latin ''lex'' 'law', is any expert or student of law.

It was especially used since the [[Carolingian]] dynasty for royal councillors who advised the monarch in legal matters, and specifically helped base its absolutist ambitions on [[Roman Law]]. More generally they were teachers of civil or Roman law, who, besides expounding sources, explaining terms, elucidating texts, summarizing the contents of chapters etc., illustrated by cases, real or imaginary, the numerous questions and distinctions arising out of the "Corpus Juris" enactments of the ancient Roman code.
 
From the twelfth century, when a fresh impulse was given to legal researches, the terms legist and [[decretist]] -- the latter applied, in the narrower sense, to the interpreter of ecclesiastical [[canon law]] and commentator on the canonical texts—have been carefully distinguished.
 
Legists came to be employed by lower authorities in the feudal pyramid. The rise of universities would lead to academical lawyers taking their place in the western world.

By analogy, the term is also applied to equivalent legal advisers in other traditions, e.g. in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and/or civil law of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

'''Lewis Mumford''' (October 19, 1895&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1990) was an American historian, [[Sociology|sociologist]], philosopher of technology, and [[Literary criticism|literary critic]]. Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir [[Patrick Geddes]] and worked closely with his associate the British sociologist [[Victor Branford]].

Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Clarence Stein]], [[Frederic Osborn]], [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund N. Bacon]], and [[Vannevar Bush]].

== Life ==

Mumford was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], New York and graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/instadv/quest/cityascommunity.html |title=City As Community: The Life And Vision Of Lewis Mumford |first=Robert |last=Wojtowicz |journal=Quest |publisher=[[Old Dominion University]] |date=Jan 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[City College of New York]] and [[The New School|The New School for Social Research]], but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/mumfordl|title=Mumford, Lewis|last=Sorensen|first=Lee (ed)|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of ''[[The Dial]]'', an influential [[modernist]] literary journal. He later worked for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.

Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. ''The Golden Day'' contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s American [[transcendentalist]] authors and ''Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision'' effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of [[Herman Melville]]. Soon after, with the book ''The Brown Decades'', he began to establish himself as an authority in American architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.

In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and [[mass communication]] to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], [[Louis Sullivan]] and Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1963, Mumford received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=Oct 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/chronology_lm.htm|title=Chronology of Mumford's Life|publisher=Lewis Mumford Center|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary [[British honours system|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1976, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1986, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;

== Ideas ==

In his book ''The Condition of Man'', published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as "organic humanism".  The term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature's threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford's respect for human "nature", that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and technics in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.

Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex.  He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information "pooling" in the world as humanity moved into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumford | first = Lewis| title = Enough Energy for Life &amp; The Next Transformation of Man [MIT lecture transcript] | journal = CoEvolution Quarterly| volume = 1| issue = 4| pages = 19–23| publisher = POINT Foundation | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's choice of the word "technics" throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[:wikt:τέχνη#Ancient Greek|tekhne]]'', which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the "wishes, habits, ideas, goals" as well as "industrial processes" of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'', "other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics."

===Megatechnics===
In ''[[The Myth of the Machine]] Vol II: The Pentagon of Power'' (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford [[Critique of technology|criticizes the modern trend of technology]], which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics", fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[installment plan|installment buying]], non-functioning and defective designs, [[planned obsolescence]], and frequent [[planned obsolescence (business)|superficial "fashion" changes]]. "Without constant enticement by advertising," he writes, "production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year."

He uses his own [[refrigerator]] as an example, reporting that it "has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use."

===Biotechnics===
[[File:Mumford3.jpg|thumb|Pentagon of Power picture and a quote from it.]]
Mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability.  The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity.  Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically.  Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'', and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., ''Bladerunner''). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pentagon of Power'' p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of "megatechnics." While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.

In Mumford's understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.

Thus Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve "livability." Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls "plenitude"; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue "for its own sake."

Alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward "qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair." The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.

Mumford's critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford's work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: "livability," a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, [[Patrick Geddes]].

Mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of ''The Pentagon of Power'', written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of "organic humanism," in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics.  It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.

It is true that Mumford's writing privileges the term "biotechnics" more than the "biotechnic society." The reason is clear in the last sentence of ''The Pentagon of Power'' where he writes, "for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out." Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them "coffins"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., he published a critical review of [[Process and Reality]]: "Metaphysics and Art. Review of Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, by Alfred North Whitehead; Essays in Philosophy, edited by Thomas Vernor Smith and William Kelley Wright; The Philosophic Way of Life, by T.V. Smith." ''The New Republic'', December 18, 1929: 117–118, reprinted in Alan Van Wyk and [[Michel Weber]] (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279954/Creativity_and_Its_Discontents._The_Response_to_Whiteheads_Process_and_Reality Creativity and Its Discontents. The Response to Whitehead's Process and Reality]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2009, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnics versus monotechnics===
A key idea, introduced in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934) was that technology was twofold:
* ''Polytechnic'', which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
* ''Monotechnic'', which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.

Mumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being "monotechnic" in their reliance on cars. [[Automobile]]s become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as [[walking]], bicycle and [[public transit]], because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a "ritual sacrifice" the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.

===Three epochs of civilization===
Also discussed at length in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):
:* ''Eotechnic'' (the [[middle ages]])
:* ''Paleotechnic'' (the time of the [[industrial revolution]]) and
:* ''Neotechnic'' (later, present-day)

===Megamachines===
Mumford also refers to large [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizations as ''megamachines''—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's [[stage theory]] of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] [[nuclear powers]]—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the [[Kremlin]] and [[the Pentagon]], respectively. The builders of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the armies of the [[World War]]s are prior examples.

He explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged [[pharaoh]]s and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from [[ancient Egypt]] to [[Nazi Germany]].

Necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous [[bureaucracy]] of humans which act as "servo-units", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the [[assembly line]], or instant, global, [[wireless]], communication and [[remote control]], can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of [[Adolf Eichmann]], the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of [[the Holocaust]]. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as "Eichmanns".

===The clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution===

One of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] was developed by monks in the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole [[Industrial Revolution]], contrary to the common view of the [[steam engine]] holding the prime position, writing: "The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ...."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. ''Technics and Civilization''. London: Routledge, 1934. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban civilization===
''[[The City in History]]'' won the 1962 U.S. [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1962&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 "National Book Awards – 1962"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of [[urban sprawl]], Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While [[pessimist]]ic in tone, Mumford argues that [[urban planning]] should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.

Mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the "ideal city," and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.

Mumford wrote critically of [[urban culture]] believing the city is "a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, ''The Culture of Cities,'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared "metropolitan finance," urbanisation, politics, and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Mumford wrote: "The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community."&lt;ref&gt;City Reader
 edited by Richard T. LeGates, Frederic Stout, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburbs====
Suburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis.  ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects'' (New York, 1961), p.464; quoted in {{cite crabgrass}}, pp.155–156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion and Spirituality ===
Mumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manouchehrifar|first=Babak|date=2018-11-08|title=Is Planning 'Secular'?

&lt;blockquote&gt;The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/246342365|title=Faith for living|last=1895-1990.|first=Mumford, Lewis,|date=1940|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|oclc=246342365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence ==

Mumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  "polytechnics", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Richard. ''The Value of Voluntary Simplicity''. Pendle Hill, 1936, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amory Lovins]], [[J. Baldwin]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Colin Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Influences: Voices of Creative Dissent''. Green Books, 1991, pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.

Mumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like [[Barry Commoner]] and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Derek. ''Green History'', Routledge, 1994, pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramachandra Guha]] noted his work contains "some of the earliest and finest thinking on [[bioregionalism]], anti-nuclearism, [[biodiversity]], alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guha, Ramachandra &amp; Martinez-Alier, J. (1997) ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South''. London: Earthscan (1997). For other works on Mumford's ecological and environmental thought, see: David Pepper ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996; Max Nicolson, ''The New Environmental Age'', Cambridge University Press, 1989; and BA Minteer, ''The Landscape of Reform: Civic Pragmatism and Environmental Thought in America'' MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including [[Berenice Abbott]]'s photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Peter. "Becoming Documentary: Berenice Abbott's Photographs, 1925–1939," PhD dissertation, Boston University, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford was an inspiration for [[Ellsworth Toohey]], the antagonist in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Walter (1998). "[http://reason.com/archives/1998/02/01/the-writerly-rand The Writerly Rand]", Reason.com, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

In some theories of syntax and grammar, in particular in the Chomskyan schools of [[government and binding theory]] and the [[minimalist program]], the '''Logical Form''' (abbreviated '''LF''' and conventionally spelled with capital initial letters) of a linguistic expression is a [[mental representation]] of it, derived solely from [[surface structure]]. In the words of [[Noam Chomsky]], LF captures "those aspects of semantic representation that are strictly determined by grammar, abstracted from other cognitive systems".{{sfn|Collinge|1990}} It functions as the interface between grammar and conceptual-intentional properties of language, analogous to how the '''[[phonetic form]]''' (abbreviated '''PF''') is the interface between grammar and the audio-perceptual properties of utterances.

Logical Form is the level of representation that affects the semantic interpretation of a sentence. LF is sometimes referred to as a [[Covert (linguistics)|covert]] level of representation, because the output of this level is not actually pronounced by the speaker.{{sfn|Ouhalla|1999}}

Many theories of syntax do not acknowledge the concept of Logical Form (e.g. [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Dependency grammar|Dependency Grammars]], [[Tree-Adjoining Grammar]], etc.), at least not in the way it is understood in Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program. The postulation of such a level of representation remains a subject of debate.

== Syntax interfacing with semantics ==
The notion of Logical Form was originally invented for the purpose of determining [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] scope. As the theory around the Minimalist program developed, all output conditions, such as theta-criterion, the case filter, Subjacency and [[binding theory]], are examined at the level of LF. The study of LF is more broad than the study of [[syntax]].{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003|pages=607, 633}}

=== The notion of scope ===

The definition of scope was introduced early in the development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only within its own domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting some aspect of the interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-[[pronoun]], quantifier-[[negative polarity item]].

In instances where a negation has an indefinite article in its scope, the reader's interpretation is affected. The reader is not able to infer the existence of a relevant entity. If negation (or a negation phrase) is within the subject quantifier scope, [[negation]] is not affected by the quantifier.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}
If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in the domain of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are in the domain of the other, the structure is potentially ambiguous. If neither QE is in the domain of the other, they must be interpreted independently.{{sfn|Ioup|1975}} These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, ''that every boy left upset a teacher'', it cannot be interpreted as ''for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset by the fact that the boy left''. The only available interpretation is that ''one single teacher was upset''.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}

[[File:LF-everyone loves someone 2.png|thumb|Everyone loves the same someone]][[File:LF-everyone loves someone.png|thumb|Everyone has someone that they love, not necessarily the same person]]

=== Ambiguity motivation ===

In syntax, LF exists to give a structural account of certain kinds of [[semantics|semantic]] ambiguities.

==== Example ====

: ''Everyone loves someone.''

This sentence is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, it contains a [[Free variables and bound variables|scope]] ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since ''someone'', being within the [[verb phrase]], must be lower in the structure than ''everyone''. This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is ''insufficiently specified'' for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order to account for the ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, [[logical form]] in [[logic]].{{sfn|Hanna|2006|pages=50–51}}

== Quantification ==

=== Key historical developments===
There has been discussion about quantification since the 1970s. In 1974, Montague argued that a grammar for a small fragment of English contains the logicosyntactic and semantic devices to handle practically any scope phenomenon.{{sfn|Montague|1974}} The tool that he mainly relied on is categorical syntax with functional application; in terms of recent formulations, it can be considered Minimalist syntax with [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] only. However, this approach does not make predictions for some examples with inverse scope (wide scope in [[object (grammar)|object]] position).

For example, '''''everyone loves someone'''''.

When there is no scope interaction in the relevant portion of the sentence, making either choice shows no difference in semantics.

A short time later, May suggested a different idea.{{sfn|May|1977}} In contrast to Montague, May did not propose any syntax that generates the surface string. He proposed a rule called Quantifier Raising (QR), which explains that movement operations of [[wh-movement]] continue to operate on the level of LF, and each phrase continues to possess the quantifier in its domain. May suggested that QR applies to all quantifier phrases with no exception.

The study of Quantification carried on in the 1980s. In contrast to May and Montague, it was suggested that independently motivated phrase structure, such as the relative clause, imposes a limitation on scope options.{{sfn|Reinhart|1983}}

This clause boundedness somewhat restricts the QR. May also noticed a subject-object asymmetry with respect to the interaction of wh-words and quantifier phrases.{{sfn|May|1985}} A modified version of his past work that QR determines quantifier scope but does not disambiguate it was brought up. To regulate the interaction, The Scope Principle that if two operators govern each other, they can be interpreted in either scopal order was also brought up. However, this solution has eventually been abandoned.

As [[Minimalism]] showed up in 1990s, more studies have been related to Minimalist syntax.{{sfn|Chomsky|1993}} A strategy to remedy the situation is to eliminate QR and the expected scope would be by-products of entirely independent grammatical processes.{{sfn|Hornstein|1995}} The other strategy is to modify QR and show it can be fitted into a Minimalist structure.{{sfn|Beghelli|1993}}{{sfn|Beghelli|Stowell|1997}}

===Quantificational noun phrases===
Danny Fox discusses syntactic positions of QNPs as a way of introducing and illustrating the basic semantic and syntactic relations found in LF.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} By looking at the meaning of QNPs in relation to the property they are given, or their predicate, we can derive the meaning of the whole sentence.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
a. ''A girl is tall.''

b. ''Many girls are tall.''

c. ''Every girl is tall.''

d. ''No girl is tall.''{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}
To understand the Logical Form of these examples, it is important to identify what the basic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate is tall and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

Each of the examples above will have different conditions that make the statement true according to the quantifier that precedes girl.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
'''Truth Value conditions:'''

Example a. ''A girl'' has a truth value of '''true if and only if''' ([[iff]]) at least one girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example b. ''Many girls'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' there are many girls who are tall.  &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with more than 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example c. ''Every girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' every girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that every instance of a person being female, she must be tall.

Example d. ''No girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' no girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that for all instances of a person being female, she must not be tall.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}

In a syntactic tree, the structure is represented as such: "the [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of a QNP is always the sister of the QNP."{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

== WH-movement ==
In linguistics, wh-phrases are operators binding variables at LF, like other quantifier noun phrases. Scope interpretations can be constrained by syntactic constraints as shown in LF when regarding the scope of wh-phrases and quantifiers. When [[wh-movement]] is from the subject position it is unambiguous, but when wh-movement is from the object position it is ambiguous.{{sfn|May|1985}}

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
1) What did everyone buy for Max?

:''[S’ what&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S everyone&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Two possible interpretations: what did everyone

:'''collectively buy''', versus '''individually buy''')

2) Who bought everything for Max?

:''[S’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Only one possible interpretation.)

|}

This example demonstrates the effect of the Path Containment Condition (PCC). An A'-path is a line of dominating nodes that go from the trace to a c-commanding A'-binder. If two of the A'paths intersect then one must be contained in the other. If the paths are overlapping without having one being contained in the other, then it is ill-formed. (2)'s paths are overlapping, violating PCC, therefore in order to obtain a grammatical LF structure, everything needs to join the VP. The LF structure then becomes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: LF REPRESENTATION:
:[s’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [s e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [vp everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [vp bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]
  |}

== Cross-linguistic examples==

=== Hungarian ===

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The tree to show the Hungarian data in support of Beghelli and Stowell.png|thumb|right|The tree structure has been abbreviated. It is to show the linear relation between three QP: ''Öt orvos'', ''minden betegnek'', and ''kevés új tablettát'']] --&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: Öt orvos minden betegnek kevés új tablettát írt fel.
: five doctor every patient-Dat few new pill-Acc wrote up
: ''"There are five doctors x such that for every patient y, x prescribed few new pills to y. "''
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
:  *Öt orvos kevés betegnek minden új tablettát írt fel.
: five doctor few patient-Dat every new pill-Acc wrote up
: ''"There are five doctors x such that for some patient y,x prescribed a new pill to y. "''
|}

In the sentence, ''"Five doctors prescribed few new pills to every patient."'', the scope in Hungarian is largely disambiguated by the linear order of quantifiers on the surface. Two facts that should be kept in mind are (1) the linear order is not obtained by putting quantifiers together in the desired order, which contradicts the predictions made by Montague or May's theory; (2) the linear order is not determined by case or grammatical functions, which supports the prediction of Hornstein's theory. {{sfn|Szabolcsi|2002}}

=== Chinese ===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The syntax tree to clarify the Logical Form in Mandarin data.png|thumb|left|The tree structure is highly abbreviated. It is to show the relative position of two QP in the first Mandarin sentence. QP ''liangge nuren'' takes a higher position, in AgrSP, than QP ''meiben shu'', in AgrOP.]] --&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: 1. Yaoshi liangge nuren  du  guo meiben shu...
:     if      two   women read Asp every book
:  i. ''"if there are two women who read every book..."''
:  ii. ''"*if for every book, there are two women who read it... "''
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: 2. Yaoshi liangge xiansuo bei meigeren zhaodao...
:      if     two     clues  by  everyone  found
:  i. ''"if there are two clues that are found by everyone... "''
:  ii. ''"if for everyone, there are two clues she or he finds... "''
|}

The significance of A-chains has been emphasized in the Chinese language. Scope in Chinese is disambiguated by case positions in some examples. {{sfn|Aoun|Li|1993}} In this example, the active sentence only has subject wide scope, but the passive sentence is ambiguous. The active sentence only has one interpretation: 
if there are two women who read every book, which is in the subject wide scope. According to Aoun and Li, Chinese does not have VP-internal subjects, thus, ''liangge nuren'' cannot be reconstructed in LF. So the sentence has no ambiguous interpretation. However, the passive sentence has two interpretations, 1. everyone finds the same two clues; 2. everyone finds two clues, while two clues can be different ones. That is because ''liangge xiansuo'' is in VP-internal complement position, then in LF, it can be reconstructed. So the passive sentence has two different interpretations.

=== English ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: ''A boy climbed every tree.''
: i. A single boy climbed all the trees.
: ii.For every tree there is a boy, who may be different for each tree, that climbed tree X.
|}

This phrase is ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe be different for each tree takes a narrow scope.

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

The '''organon model''', formulated by [[Karl Bühler]], defined the functions of communication according to which linguistic communication can be described. Bühler's work influenced [[Roman Jakobson]] for his [[Jakobson's functions of language|communication model]].

Bühler identified the following three communicative functions:
* the ''expressive function'' (''Ausdrucksfunktion'')
* the ''representation function'' (''Darstellungsfunktion'')
* the ''conative function'' (''Appellfunktion'', i.e. appealing function).

This article discusses the history and development of [[oscilloscope]] technology. The modern day digital [[oscilloscope]] grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn grew out of the older [[oscillograph]]. The oscillograph started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the oscillograph, eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the digital oscilloscope has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray tube oscilloscopes. However, the oscillograph lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.

== Hand-drawn oscillograms ==
[[File:Oscillograph Joubert's Step-by-Step Method.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of Joubert's step-by-step method of hand-plotting waveform measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|p=1844}} Fig. 2589&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest method of creating an image of a waveform was through a laborious and painstaking process of measuring the voltage or current of a spinning rotor at specific points around the axis of the rotor, and noting the measurements taken with a [[galvanometer]]. By slowly advancing around the rotor, a general standing wave can be drawn on graphing paper by recording the degrees of rotation and the meter strength at each position.

This process was first partially automated by [[Jules François Joubert]] with his ''step-by-step'' method of wave form measurement. This consisted of a special single-contact [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] attached to the shaft of a spinning rotor. The contact point could be moved around the rotor following a precise degree indicator scale and the output appearing on a galvanometer, to be hand-graphed by the technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|pp=1841–1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process could only produce a very rough waveform approximation since it was formed over a period of several thousand wave cycles, but it was the first step in the science of waveform imaging.

|}

The first automated oscillographs used a galvanometer to move a pen across a scroll or drum of paper, capturing wave patterns onto a continuously moving scroll. Due to the relatively high-frequency speed of the waveforms compared to the slow reaction time of the mechanical components, the waveform image was not drawn directly but instead built up over a period of time by combining small pieces of many different waveforms, to create an averaged shape.

The device known as the Hospitalier Ondograph was based on this method of wave form measurement. It automatically charged a capacitor from each 100th wave, and discharged the stored energy through a recording galvanometer, with each successive charge of the capacitor being taken from a point a little farther along the wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1917|pp=1849–1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such wave-form measurements were still averaged over many hundreds of wave cycles but were more accurate than hand-drawn oscillograms.)

In order to permit direct measurement of waveforms it was necessary for the recording device to use a very low-mass measurement system that can move with sufficient speed to match the motion of the actual waves being measured. This was done with the development of the ''moving-coil oscillograph'' by [[William Duddell]] which in modern times is also referred to as a [[mirror galvanometer]]. This reduced the measurement device to a small mirror that could move at high speeds to match the waveform.

To perform a waveform measurement, a photographic slide would be dropped past a window where the light beam emerges, or a continuous roll of motion picture film would be scrolled across the aperture to record the waveform over time. Although the measurements were much more precise than the built-up paper recorders, there was still room for improvement due to having to develop the exposed images before they could be examined.

== A tiny tilting mirror ==
In the 1920s, a tiny tilting mirror attached to a diaphragm at the apex of a horn provided good response up to a few kHz, perhaps even 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. A time base, unsynchronized, was provided by a spinning mirror polygon, and a collimated beam of light from an arc lamp projected the waveform onto the lab wall or a screen.
&lt;!-- ref.: _The Science of Musical Sounds_, by Dayton Clarence Miller, published about 1924 --&gt;

Even earlier, audio applied to a diaphragm on the gas feed to a flame made the flame height vary, and a spinning mirror polygon gave an early glimpse of waveforms. &lt;!-- Late 1800s, possibly? Ganot's Physics, a very popular 19th-C physics text? IIrc, Miller also described this. --&gt;

Moving-paper oscillographs using UV-sensitive paper and advanced mirror galvanometers provided multi-channel recordings in the mid-20th century. Frequency response was into at least the low audio range.

== CRT invention ==
[[Image:CRT oscilloscope.png|thumb|400px|The interior of a [[cathode-ray tube]] for use in an oscilloscope. '''1.''' Deflection voltage electrode; '''2.''' Electron gun; '''3.''' Electron beam; '''4.''' Focusing coil; '''5.''' Phosphor-coated inner side of the screen]]
[[Cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) were developed in the late 19th century. At that time, the tubes were intended primarily to demonstrate and explore the physics of [[electrons]] (then known as [[cathode ray]]s). [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] invented the CRT oscilloscope as a physics curiosity in 1897, by applying an oscillating signal to electrically charged deflector plates in a [[phosphor]]-coated CRT. Braun tubes were laboratory apparatus, using a cold-cathode emitter and very high voltages (on the order of 20,000 to 30,000 volts). With only vertical deflection applied to the internal plates, the face of the tube was observed through a rotating mirror to provide a horizontal time base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Abramson|1995|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 [[Jonathan Zenneck]] equipped the cathode ray tube with beam-forming plates and used a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.&lt;ref name="kul03"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kularatna | first1 = Nihal | title = Digital and analogue instrumentation: testing and measurement | chapter = Chapter 5: Fundamentals of Oscilloscopes | publisher = Institution of Engineering and Technology | year = 2003 | page = 165 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac5iYqHCcucC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-01-19 | isbn = 978-0-85296-999-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as early as 1919 &lt;ref name=Burns98&gt;{{Harvtxt|Burns|1998|pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. The application of a [[Thermionic emission|thermionic]] emitter allowed operating voltage to be dropped to a few hundred volts. [[Western Electric]] introduced a commercial tube of this type, which relied on a small amount of gas within the tube to assist in focussing the electron beam.&lt;ref name=Burns98/&gt;

[[Vladimir K. Zworykin|V. K. Zworykin]] described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed [[General Radio]] to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="kul03"/&gt;

The first dual-beam oscilloscope was developed in the late 1930s by the British company [[A.C.Cossor]] (later acquired by [[Raytheon]]). The CRT was not a true double beam type but used a split beam made by placing a third plate between the vertical deflection plates. It was widely used during WWII for the development and servicing of [[radar]] equipment. Although extremely useful for examining the performance of pulse circuits it was not calibrated so could not be used as a measuring device. It was, however, useful in producing response curves of IF circuits and consequently a great aid in their accurate alignment.

Allen B. Du Mont Labs. made moving-film cameras, in which continuous film motion provided the time base. Horizontal deflection was probably disabled, although a very slow sweep would have spread phosphor wear. CRTs with P11 phosphor were either standard or available.&lt;!-- ref.: Oscilloscope catalog, Allen B. DuMont Labs, possibly 1949. --&gt;

Long-persistence CRTs, sometimes used in oscilloscopes for displaying slowly changing signals or single-shot events, used a phosphor such as P7, which comprised a double layer. The inner layer fluoresced bright blue from the electron beam, and its light excited a phosphorescent "outer" layer, directly visible inside the envelope (bulb). The latter stored the light, and released it with a yellowish glow with decaying brightness over tens of seconds. This type of phosphor was also used in radar analog PPI CRT displays, which are a graphic decoration (rotating radial light bar) in some TV weather-report scenes.

== Sweep circuit ==
The technology for the horizontal sweep, that portion of the oscilloscope that creates the horizontal time axis, has changed.

===Synchronized sweep===
[[File:Heathkit Oscilloscope OM-2.jpg|thumb|Oscilloscope with synchronized sweep. "HOR. SELECTOR" sets horizontal frequency range (the capacitor); "FREQ. VERNIER" adjusts the free-running frequency; "SYNC. AMPLITUDE" sets the gain to the comparator.]]
Early oscilloscopes used a synchronized sawtooth waveform generator to provide the time axis.  The sawtooth would be made by charging a capacitor with a relatively constant current; that would create a rising voltage.  The rising voltage would be fed to the horizontal deflection plates to create the sweep.  The rising voltage would also be fed to a comparator; when the capacitor reached a certain level, the capacitor would be discharged, the trace would return to the left, and the capacitor (and the sweep) would start another traverse.  The operator would adjust the charging current so the sawtooth generator would have a slightly longer period than a multiple of the vertical axis signal.  For example, when looking at a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz sinewave (1&amp;nbsp;ms period), the operator might adjust the horizontal frequency to a little bit more than 5&amp;nbsp;ms. When the input signal was absent, the sweep would free run at that frequency.

If the input signal were present, the resulting display would not be stable at the horizontal sweep's free-running frequency because it was not a submultiple of the input (vertical axis) signal. To fix that, the sweep generator would be synchronized by adding a scaled version of the input the signal to the sweep generator's comparator. The added signal would cause the comparator to trip a little earlier and thus synchronize it to the input signal. The operator could adjust the synch level; for some designs, the operator could choose the polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=Knight Electronics Corporation |location=Maywood, IL |year=1965 |title=Operator's Manual: Model KG-635 DC to 5.2 MC 5" Wideband Oscilloscope |page=3 |quote=Synchronization ... + internal, − internal, 60 cps, and external. Sync limiting provides semi-automatic operation with level control.  Locks from waveform fundamentals up to 5 mc. Will sync on display amplitudes as low as 0.1 [inch]}}  The KG-635 sync amplifier used a 12AT7 differential amplifier (V5). (id p. 15.)  Sync level control would bias the amplifier into cutoff so action would only occur near the end of the sweep; the sync output was a negative pulse to the sweep generator; a diode pulse limiter clamped the sync pulse. (id p. 18.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The sweep generator would turn off (known as blanking) the beam during retrace.&lt;ref&gt;KG-635 p. 18 stating, "Retrace blanking is obtained from the plate of V-6A and applied to the cathode of the CRT."&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting horizontal sweep speed was uncalibrated because the sweep rate was adjusted by changing slope of the sawtooth generator. The time per division on the display depended upon the sweep's free-running frequency and a horizontal gain control.

A synchronized sweep oscilloscope could not display a non-periodic signal because it could not synchronize the sweep generator to that signal. Horizontal circuits were often AC-coupled

===Triggered sweep ===
During World War II, a few oscilloscopes used for radar development (and a few laboratory oscilloscopes) had so-called driven sweeps. These sweep circuits remained dormant, with the CRT beam cut off, until a drive pulse from an external device unblanked the CRT and started a constant-speed horizontal trace; the calibrated speed permitted measurement of time intervals. When the sweep was complete, the sweep circuit blanked the CRT (turned off the beam), reset itself, and waited for the next drive pulse. The Dumont 248, a commercially available oscilloscope produced in 1945, had this feature.

Oscilloscopes became a much more useful tool in 1946 when [[Howard Vollum]] and [[Melvin Jack Murdock]] introduced the Tektronix Model 511 ''triggered-sweep'' oscilloscope. Howard Vollum had first seen this technology in use in Germany. The triggered sweep has a circuit that develops the driven sweep's drive pulse from the input signal.

Triggering allows stationary display of a repeating waveform, as multiple repetitions of the waveform are drawn over exactly the same trace on the phosphor screen. A triggered sweep maintains the calibration of sweep speed, making it possible to measure properties of the waveform such as frequency, phase, rise time, and others, that would not otherwise be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|Howarth|1972|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, triggering can occur at varying intervals, so there is no requirement that the input signal be periodic.
[[File:Triggered Sweep Controls on Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|Triggered sweep controls on a Tektronix 465 oscilloscope]]
Triggered-sweep oscilloscopes compare the vertical deflection signal (or rate of change of the signal) with an adjustable threshold, referred to as trigger level. As well, the trigger circuits also recognize the slope direction of the vertical signal when it crosses the threshold—whether the vertical signal is positive-going or negative-going at the crossing. This is called trigger polarity. When the vertical signal crosses the set trigger level and in the desired direction, the trigger circuit unblanks the CRT and starts an accurate linear sweep. After the completion of the horizontal sweep, the next sweep will occur when the signal once again crosses the threshold trigger.

Variations in triggered-sweep oscilloscopes include models offered with CRTs using long-persistence [[Phosphor|phosphors]], such as type P7. These oscilloscopes were used for applications where the horizontal trace speed was very slow, or there was a long delay between sweeps, to provide a persistent screen image. Oscilloscopes without triggered sweep could also be retro-fitted with triggered sweep using a solid-state circuit developed by [[Harry Garland]] and [[Roger Melen]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Popular Electronics| title = Add Triggered Sweep to your Scope | last1 = Garland | first1 = Harry  | last2 = Melen | first2 = Roger | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–66 | year = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As oscilloscopes have become more powerful over time, enhanced triggering options allow capture and display of more complex waveforms. For example, ''[[trigger holdoff]]'' is a feature in most modern oscilloscopes that can be used to define a certain period following a trigger during which the oscilloscope will not trigger again. This makes it easier to establish a stable view of a waveform with multiple edges which would otherwise cause another trigger. &lt;!-- duplicated details in this paragraph; I'll try to fix this, but feel free to remind me! -- Nikevich--&gt;

== Tektronix ==
[[Image:Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Type 465 [[Tektronix]] oscilloscope, a popular analog oscilloscope during the 1980s]]
Vollum and Murdock went on to found [[Tektronix]], the first manufacturer of calibrated oscilloscopes (which included a [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] on the screen and produced plots with calibrated scales on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] of the screen).{{cn|date=January 2016}} Later developments by Tektronix included the development of multiple-trace oscilloscopes for comparing signals either by time-[[multiplexing]] (via chopping or trace alternation) or by the presence of multiple [[electron gun]]s in the tube. In 1963, Tektronix introduced the [[DVBST|Direct View Bistable Storage Tube (DVBST)]], which allowed observing single pulse waveforms rather than (as previously) only repeating wave forms. Using [[micro-channel plate]]s, a variety of secondary-emission electron multiplier inside the CRT and behind the faceplate, the most advanced analog oscilloscopes (for example, the Tek 7104 mainframe) could display a visible trace (or allow the photography) of a single-shot event even when running at extremely fast sweep speeds. This oscilloscope went to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

In vacuum-tube oscilloscopes made by Tektronix, the vertical amplifier's delay line was a long frame, L-shaped for space reasons, that carried several dozen discrete inductors and a corresponding number of low-capacitance adjustable ("trimmer") cylindrical capacitors. These oscilloscopes had plug-in vertical input channels. For adjusting the delay line capacitors, a high-pressure gas-filled mercury-wetted reed switch created extremely fast-rise pulses which went directly to the later stages of the vertical amplifier. With a fast sweep, any misadjustment created a dip or bump, and touching a capacitor made its local part of the waveform change. Adjusting the capacitor made its bump disappear. Eventually, a flat top resulted.

Vacuum-tube output stages in early wideband oscilloscopes used radio transmitting tubes, but they consumed a lot of power. Picofarads of capacitance to ground limited bandwidth. A better design, called a distributed amplifier, used multiple tubes, but their inputs (control grids) were connected along a tapped L-C delay line, so the tubes' input capacitances became part of the delay line. As well, their outputs (plates/anodes) were likewise connected to another tapped delay line, its output feeding the deflection plates. (This amplifier was push-pull, so there were four delay lines, two for input, and two for output.)

== Digital oscilloscopes ==
{{details|Oscilloscope types#Digital oscilloscopes}}
[[File:Handheld Oscilloscope SHS800.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern Siglent SHS800 handheld digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) using an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] for its display]]
The first [[Digital Storage Oscilloscope]] (DSO) was invented by [[Nicolet Test Instrument]] of Madison, Wisconsin.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  It was a low speed ADC (1 MHz, 12 bit) used primarily for vibration and medical analysis.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  The first high speed DSO (100 MHz, 8 bit) was invented by [[Walter LeCroy]] (who founded the [[LeCroy Corporation]], based in New York, USA) after producing high-speed digitizers for the research center [[CERN]] in Switzerland. LeCroy (since 2012 Teledyne LeCroy) remains one of the three largest manufacturers of oscilloscopes in the world.

Starting in the 1980s, [[digital electronics|digital]] oscilloscopes became prevalent. Digital storage oscilloscopes use a fast [[analog-to-digital converter]] and memory chips to record and show a digital representation of a waveform, yielding much more flexibility for triggering, analysis, and display than is possible with a classic analog oscilloscope. Unlike its analog predecessor, the digital storage oscilloscope can show pre-trigger events, opening another dimension to the recording of rare or intermittent events and [[troubleshooting]] of electronic [[glitch]]es. As of 2006 most new oscilloscopes (aside from education and a few niche markets) are digital.

Digital scopes rely on effective use of the installed memory and trigger functions: not enough memory and the user will miss the events they want to examine; if the scope has a large memory but does not trigger as desired, the user will have difficulty finding the event.

DSOs also led to the creation of hand-held digital oscilloscopes (pictured), useful for many test and field service applications. A hand held oscilloscope is usually a digital sampling oscilloscope, using a [[liquid crystal display]] for its display.

Due to the recent rise in the prevalence of PCs, PC-based oscilloscopes have been becoming more common. Typically, a signal will be captured on external hardware (which includes an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and memory) and transmitted to the computer, where it is processed and displayed.

The Paleolithic is followed in Europe by the [[Mesolithic]], although the date of the transition varies geographically by several thousand years.

During the Paleolithic, hominins grouped together in small societies such as [[band society|bands]], and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing, hunting or scavenging wild animals.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite book | author=McClellan

Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including [[leather]] and vegetable [[fiber]]s; however, due to their nature, these have not been preserved to any great degree.

About 50,000 years ago, there was a marked increase in the diversity of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. In Africa, bone artifacts and the first [[art]] appear in the archaeological record. The first evidence of human [[fishing]] is also noted, from artifacts in places such as [[Blombos cave]] in [[South Africa]]. Archaeologists classify artifacts of the last 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools.

Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus ''[[Homo]]—''such as ''Homo habilis'', who used simple stone tools—into [[anatomically modern humans|anatomically]] [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] as well as [[Behaviourally modern humans|behaviorally]] [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] by the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394/Human_Evolution.html "Human Evolution," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5lCsAZ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394/Human_Evolution.html |date=2009-11-01 }} Contributed by Richard B.

==Etymology of paleolithic==
The term "[[wikt:Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]]" was coined by archaeologist John Lubbock in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubbock |first=John |author-link=John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury |orig-year=1872 |year=2005 |title=Pre-Historic Times, as Illustrated by Ancient Remains, and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages |publisher=Williams and Norgate |page=75 |via=Elibron Classics |chapter=4 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t7vm4dg4c;view=1up;seq=87 |isbn=978-1421270395}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from Greek: [[wikt:παλαιός|παλαιός]], ''palaios'', "old"; and [[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]], ''lithos'', "stone", meaning "old age of the stone" or "Old [[Stone Age]]".

==Paleogeography and climate==

&lt;!---[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The Paleolithic climate consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods.]]---&gt;
The Paleolithic coincides almost exactly with the [[Pleistocene]] epoch of geologic time, which lasted from 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago to about 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/pleistocene.php|title=The Pleistocene Epoch|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This epoch experienced important geographic and climatic changes that affected human societies.

During the preceding [[Pliocene]], continents had continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] from possibly as far as {{cvt|250|km|lk=on|abbr=off}} from their present locations to positions only {{cvt|70|km}} from their current location. South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]], bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[marsupial]] fauna. The formation of the isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, because warm [[equator]]ial ocean currents were cut off, and the cold Arctic and Antarctic waters lowered temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean.

Most of [[Central America]] formed during the Pliocene to connect the continents of North and South America, allowing fauna from these continents to leave their native habitats and colonize new areas.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pli.html |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pliocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa's collision with Asia created the Mediterranean, cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. During the [[Pleistocene]], the modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions; the [[tectonic plate]]s on which they sit have probably moved at most {{cvt|100|km}} from each other since the beginning of the period.&lt;ref name=Scotese&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm|author=Christopher Scotese|title=Paleomap project |accessdate=2008-03-23|work=The Earth has been in an Ice House Climate for the last 30 million years|authorlink=Christopher Scotese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climates during the Pliocene became cooler and drier, and seasonal, similar to modern climates. [[Ice sheet]]s grew on [[Antarctica]]. The formation of an Arctic ice cap around 3&amp;nbsp;million years ago is signaled by an abrupt shift in [[oxygen]] [[isotope]] ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North [[Pacific Ocean]] beds.&lt;ref name="Andel"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Van Andel|first=Tjeerd H.|title=New Views on an Old Planet: A History of Global Change.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|location=Cambridge|pages=454 pp.|isbn=0-521-44243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-latitude [[glacier|glaciation]] probably began before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s.&lt;ref name=UCMPPliocene/&gt;
The [[Pleistocene]] climate was characterized by repeated glacial cycles during which [[continental glacier]]s pushed to the 40th [[parallel (latitude)|parallel]] in some places. Four major glacial events have been identified, as well as many minor intervening events. A major event is a general glacial excursion, termed a "glacial". Glacials are separated by "interglacials". During a glacial, the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats. The minor excursion is a "stadial"; times between stadials are "interstadials". Each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets {{cvt|1500–3000|m|ft|lk=on|abbr=off}} deep, resulting in temporary sea level drops of {{cvt|100|m}} or more over the entire surface of the Earth. During interglacial times, such as at present, drowned coastlines were common, mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions.
[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Antón.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Many great mammals such as [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[woolly rhinoceros]]es, and [[Panthera leo fossilis|cave lions]] inhabited the [[mammoth steppe]] during the Pleistocene.]]
The effects of glaciation were global. [[Antarctica]] was ice-bound throughout the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene. The [[Andes]] were covered in the south by the [[Patagonia]]n ice cap. There were glaciers in New Zealand and [[Tasmania]]. The now decaying glaciers of [[Mount Kenya]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Ruwenzori Range]] in east and central Africa were larger. Glaciers existed in the mountains of [[Ethiopia]] and to the west in the [[Atlas mountains]]. In the northern hemisphere, many glaciers fused into one. The [[Cordilleran ice sheet]] covered the North American northwest; the [[Laurentide]] covered the east. The Fenno-Scandian ice sheet covered northern Europe, including Great Britain; the Alpine ice sheet covered the Alps. Scattered domes stretched across [[Siberia]] and the Arctic shelf. The northern seas were frozen. During the late Upper Paleolithic (Latest Pleistocene) {{c.|18,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, the [[Beringia]] land bridge between Asia and North America was blocked by ice,&lt;ref name=Scotese/&gt; which [[Clovis culture#Evidence of human habitation before Clovis|may have prevented]] early [[Paleo-Indian]]s such as the [[Clovis culture]] from directly crossing [[Beringia]] to reach the Americas.

According to [[Mark Lynas]] (through collected data), the Pleistocene's overall climate could be characterized as a continuous [[El Niño]] with [[trade winds]] in the south [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] weakening or heading east, warm air rising near [[Peru]], warm water spreading from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific, and other El Niño markers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]], ''Six Degrees Could Change The World'', Mark Lynas interview. Retrieved February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paleolithic is often held to finish at the end of the ice age (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the extinction of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], although it is also possible that the late [[Quaternary extinction event|Pleistocene extinctions]] were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/ple.html|title=University of California Museum of Paleontology website the Pleistocene epoch(accessed March 25)|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080401-mammoth-extinction.html|author=Kimberly Johnson|title=National Geographic news|accessdate=2008-04-04|work=Climate Change, Then Humans, Drove Mammoths Extinct from National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research suggests that the extinction of the [[woolly mammoth]] may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the [[Holocene]] may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Small populations of woolly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]] and [[Wrangel Island]], until {{c.|3700}}&amp;nbsp;BCE and {{c.|1700|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BCE respectively.

==Human way of life==
[[File:Terra-Amata-Hut.gif|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of a temporary wood house, based on evidence found at [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]] (in [[Nice, France]]) and dated to the Lower Paleolithic ({{c.|400,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP)]]

Nearly all of our knowledge of Paleolithic human culture and way of life comes from [[archaeology]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] comparisons to modern hunter-gatherer cultures such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung San]] who live similarly to their Paleolithic predecessors.&lt;ref name="Leften Stavrianos"/&gt; The economy of a typical Paleolithic society was a [[hunter-gatherer]] economy.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"&gt;{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society | title=A Global History from Prehistory to the Present| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1991 | isbn=0-13-357005-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society&amp;pgis=1 Pages 9–13]&lt;/ref&gt; Humans hunted wild animals for meat and gathered food, firewood, and materials for their tools, clothes, or shelters.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt;

Human population density was very low, around only one person per square mile.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; This was most likely due to low body fat, [[infanticide]], women regularly engaging in intense endurance exercise,&lt;ref name="Schultz"/&gt; late weaning of infants, and a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; Like contemporary hunter-gatherers, Paleolithic humans enjoyed an abundance of leisure time unparalleled in both [[Neolithic]] farming societies and modern industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Felipe Fernandez Armesto |title=Ideas that changed the world |publisher=Dorling Kindersley limited|location=Newyork |year=2003 |page=400 |isbn=978-0-7566-3298-4 |oclc= |doi=}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=tFIAAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ideas+that+changed+the+world+by+Felipe+Fernandez+Armesto Page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Paleolithic, specifically the Middle or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce works of art such as [[cave painting]]s, [[rock art]] and [[jewellery]] and began to engage in religious behavior such as burial and ritual.&lt;ref name="Hillary Mayell"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0220_030220_humanorigins2_2.html|title= When Did "Modern" Behavior Emerge in Humans?|work= National Geographic News |author= Hillary Mayell |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
At the beginning of the Paleolithic, hominins were found primarily in eastern Africa, east of the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Most known hominin fossils dating earlier than one million years before present are found in this area, particularly in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Ethiopia]].

By {{c.|2,000,000|1,500,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, groups of hominins began leaving Africa and settling southern Europe and Asia. Southern Caucasus was occupied by {{c.|1,700,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP, and northern China was reached by {{c.|1,660,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP. By the end of the Lower Paleolithic, members of the hominin family were living in what is now China, western Indonesia, and, in Europe, around the Mediterranean and as far north as England, southern Germany, and Bulgaria. Their further northward expansion may have been limited by the lack of control of fire: studies of cave settlements in Europe indicate no regular use of fire prior to {{c.|400,000|300,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref&gt;"On the earliest evidence for habitual use of fire in Europe", Wil Roebroeks et al, PNAS, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

East Asian fossils from this period are typically placed in the genus ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Very little fossil evidence is available at known Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe, but it is believed that hominins who inhabited these sites were likewise ''Homo erectus''. There is no evidence of hominins in America, Australia, or almost anywhere in Oceania during this time period.

Fates of these early colonists, and their relationships to modern humans, are still subject to debate. According to current archaeological and genetic models, there were at least two notable expansion events subsequent to peopling of Eurasia {{c.|2,000,000|1,500,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP. Around 500,000&amp;nbsp;BP a group of early humans, frequently called ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', came to Europe from Africa and eventually evolved into ''Homo neanderthalensis'' ([[Neanderthal]]s). In the Middle Paleolithic, Neanderthals were present in the region now occupied by Poland.

Both ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo neanderthalensis'' became extinct by the end of the Paleolithic. Descended from ''Homo Sapiens'', the anatomically modern ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' emerged in eastern Africa {{c.|200,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP, left Africa around 50,000&amp;nbsp;BP, and expanded throughout the planet. Multiple hominid groups coexisted for some time in certain locations. '' Homo neanderthalensis'' were still found in parts of Eurasia {{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP years, and engaged in an unknown degree of interbreeding with ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. DNA studies also suggest an unknown degree of interbreeding between ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' and ''[[Homo sapiens denisova]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Callaway, Ewen (22 September 2011), "First Aboriginal genome sequenced", Nature, Nature News, doi:10.1038/news.2011.551&lt;/ref&gt;

Hominin fossils not belonging either to ''Homo neanderthalensis'' or to ''Homo sapiens'' species, found in the [[Altai Mountains]] and Indonesia, were radiocarbon dated to {{c.|30,000|40,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP and {{c.|17,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP respectively.

For the duration of the Paleolithic, human populations remained low, especially outside the equatorial region. The entire population of Europe between 16,000 and 11,000&amp;nbsp;BP likely averaged some 30,000 individuals, and between 40,000 and 16,000&amp;nbsp;BP, it was even lower at 4,000–6,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.evolhum.cnrs.fr/bocquet/jas2005.pdf|title=Estimates of Upper Palaeolithic meta-population size in Europe from archaeological data|author=Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|year=2005|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2005.05.006|volume=32|pages=1656–1668|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tools====
Paleolithic humans made tools of stone, bone, and wood.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt; The early paleolithic hominins, ''[[Australopithecus]]'', were the first users of stone tools. Excavations in Gona, Ethiopia have produced thousands of artifacts, and through radioisotopic dating and [[magnetostratigraphy]], the sites can be firmly dated to 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Evidence shows these early hominins intentionally selected raw materials with good flaking qualities and chose appropriate sized stones for their needs to produce sharp-edged tools for cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Semaw|first1=Sileshi|title=The World's Oldest Stone Artefacts from Gona, Ethiopia: Their Implications for Understanding Stone Technology and Patterns of Human Evolution Between 2.6–1.5 Million Years Ago|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2000|volume=27|issue=12|pages=1197–1214|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0592|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440399905927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Paleolithic stone tool industry, the [[Oldowan]], began around 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite book |author=Klein, R. |year=1999 |title=The Human Career |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained tools such as choppers, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, and [[stitching awl]]s. It was completely replaced around 250,000 years ago by the more complex Acheulean industry, which was first conceived by ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' around 1.8–1.65&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Roche H et al., 2002, ''Les sites archaéologiques pio-pléistocènes de la formation de Nachuku 663–673, qtd in Scarre, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Acheulean implements completely vanish from the archaeological record around 100,000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic tool kits such as the [[Mousterian]] and the [[Aterian]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Desmond Clark|Clark, JD]], ''Variability in primary and secondary technologies of the Later Acheulian in Africa'' in Milliken, S and Cook, J (eds), 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower Paleolithic humans used a variety of stone tools, including [[hand axe]]s and [[Chopper (archaeology)|choppers]]. Although they appear to have used hand axes often, there is disagreement about their use. Interpretations range from cutting and chopping tools, to digging implements, to flaking cores, to the use in traps, and as a purely ritual significance, perhaps in [[courting behavior]]. [[William H. Calvin]] has suggested that some hand axes could have served as "killer [[Frisbees]]" meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a waterhole so as to stun one of them. There are no indications of [[hafting]], and some artifacts are far too large for that. Thus, a thrown hand axe would not usually have penetrated deeply enough to cause very serious injuries. Nevertheless, it could have been an effective weapon for defense against predators. Choppers and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] were likely used for skinning and butchering scavenged animals and sharp-ended sticks were often obtained for digging up edible roots. Presumably, early humans used wooden spears as early as 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago to hunt small animals, much as their relatives, [[chimpanzee]]s, have been observed to do in [[Senegal]], Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Weiss, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html "Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lower Paleolithic humans constructed shelters, such as the possible wood hut at [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]].

Fire was used by the Lower Paleolithic hominins ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''Homo ergaster'' as early as 300,000 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago and possibly even earlier by the early Lower Paleolithic (Oldowan) hominin ''Homo habilis'' or by robust ''[[Australopithecine]]s'' such as ''[[Paranthropus]]''.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; However, the use of fire only became common in the societies of the following [[Middle Stone Age]] and [[Middle Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name=Thoth&amp;Schick/&gt; Use of fire reduced mortality rates and provided protection against predators.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marlowe FW |title=Hunter-gatherers and human evolution |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=15294 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/marlowe_pubs/hunter-gatherers%20and%20human%20evolution.pdf |doi=10.1002/evan.20046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527230019/http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/marlowe_pubs/hunter-gatherers%20and%20human%20evolution.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early hominins may have begun to cook their food as early as the Lower Paleolithic ({{c.|1.9}}&amp;nbsp;million years ago) or at the latest in the early Middle Paleolithic ({{c.|250,000}} years ago).&lt;ref name=Wrangham&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wrangham R, Conklin-Brittain N |title=Cooking as a biological trait |journal=Comp Biochem Physiol a Mol Integr Physiol |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14527628 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(03)00020-5 |url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519215539/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have hypothesized that hominins began cooking food to defrost frozen meat, which would help ensure their survival in cold regions.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt;

====Rafts====
The Lower Paleolithic ''Homo erectus'' possibly invented [[raft]]s ({{c.|840,000|800,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) to travel over large bodies of water, which may have allowed a group of ''Homo erectus'' to reach the island of [[Flores]] and evolve into the small hominin ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. However, this hypothesis is disputed within the anthropological community.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/mariner1.html |title=First Mariners Project Photo Gallery 1 |publisher=Mc2.vicnet.net.au |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025085331/http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/mariner1.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/ng2004.html |title=First Mariners – National Geographic project 2004 |publisher=Mc2.vicnet.net.au |date=2004-10-02 |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026043820/http://mc2.vicnet.net.au/home/mariners/web/ng2004.html |archivedate=2009-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible use of rafts during the Lower Paleolithic may indicate that Lower Paleolithic hominins such as ''Homo erectus'' were more advanced than previously believed, and may have even spoken an early form of modern language.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"/&gt; Supplementary evidence from Neanderthal and modern human sites located around the Mediterranean Sea, such as Coa de sa Multa ({{c.|300,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP), has also indicated that both Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans used rafts to travel over large bodies of water (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea) for the purpose of colonizing other bodies of land.&lt;ref name="vicnet1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2006"&gt;{{cite book |title= Anthropology|last=Miller |first=Barbra |author2=Bernard Wood |author3=Andrew Balansky |author4=Julio Mercader |author5=Melissa Panger  |year=2006 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston Massachusetts |isbn= 0-205-32024-4 | page= 768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advanced tools====
By around 200,000&amp;nbsp;BP, [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[stone tool]] manufacturing spawned a tool making technique known as the [[prepared-core technique]], that was more elaborate than previous [[Acheulean]] techniques.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; This technique increased efficiency by allowing the creation of more controlled and consistent [[Lithic flake|flake]]s.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; It allowed Middle Paleolithic humans to create stone tipped [[spear]]s, which were the earliest composite tools, by hafting sharp, pointy stone flakes onto wooden shafts. In addition to improving tool making methods, the Middle Paleolithic also saw an improvement of the tools themselves that allowed access to a wider variety and amount of food sources. For example, [[microlith]]s or small stone tools or points were invented around 70,000–65,000&amp;nbsp;BP and were essential to the invention of bows and [[spear thrower]]s in the following Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22/&gt;

[[Harpoon]]s were invented and used for the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic ({{c.|90,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP); the invention of these devices brought fish into the human diets, which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-1"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394_12/human_evolution.html "Human Evolution," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032236/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566394_12/human_evolution.html |date=2008-04-08 }} Contributed by Richard B.

====Other inventions====
During the [[Upper Paleolithic]], further inventions were made, such as the [[net (device)|net]] {{c.|22,000}} or {{c.|29,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP)&lt;ref name=MarloweFW22/&gt; [[bolas]],&lt;ref&gt;J.

Archaeological evidence from the [[Dordogne]] region of France demonstrates that members of the European early [[Upper Paleolithic]] culture known as the [[Aurignacian]] used calendars ({{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP).

===Social organization===
{{Unreliable sources|date=February 2010}}

[[File:Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|Humans may have taken part in long-distance trade between [[band society|bands]] for rare commodities and raw materials (such as stone needed for making tools) as early as 120,000 years ago in Middle Paleolithic.]]
The social organization of the earliest Paleolithic ([[Lower Paleolithic]]) societies remains largely unknown to scientists, though Lower Paleolithic hominins such as ''Homo habilis'' and ''Homo erectus'' are likely to have had more complex social structures than chimpanzee societies.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/ia/ia03_mod_10.html |title=Intro to archeology The First People and Culture |accessdate=2008-03-20 |author=Nancy White |work=Introduction to archeology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Oldowan/Early Acheulean humans such as ''Homo ergaster''/''Homo erectus'' may have been the first people to invent central campsites or home bases and incorporate them into their foraging and hunting strategies like contemporary hunter-gatherers, possibly as early as 1.7 million years ago;&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt; however, the earliest solid evidence for the existence of home bases or central campsites (hearths and shelters) among humans only dates back to 500,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="encarta.msn.com"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2014}}

Similarly, scientists disagree whether Lower Paleolithic humans were largely [[monogamous]] or [[polygynous]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt; In particular, the Provisional model suggests that [[bipedalism]] arose in pre-Paleolithic australopithecine societies as an adaptation to monogamous lifestyles; however, other researchers note that [[sexual dimorphism]] is more pronounced in Lower Paleolithic humans such as ''Homo erectus'' than in modern humans, who are less polygynous than other primates, which suggests that Lower Paleolithic humans had a largely polygynous lifestyle, because species that have the most pronounced sexual dimorphism tend more likely to be polygynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6937476.stm |title=Finds test human origins theory |publisher=[[BBC News]] |author=James Urquhart|accessdate=2008-03-20 | date=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human societies from the Paleolithic to the early Neolithic farming tribes lived without states and organized governments. For most of the Lower Paleolithic, human societies were possibly more hierarchical than their Middle and Upper Paleolithic descendants, and probably were not grouped into [[band society|bands]],&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208&gt;Christopher Boehm (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljxS8gUlgqgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Paleolithic&amp;lr=&amp;sig=V-GOM-s3rCApE_baw2oRoaw24w8#PPA198,M1 "Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior" page 198–208] Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; though during the end of the Lower Paleolithic, the latest populations of the hominin ''Homo erectus'' may have begun living in small-scale (possibly egalitarian) bands similar to both Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies and modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208/&gt;

Middle Paleolithic societies, unlike Lower Paleolithic and early Neolithic ones, consisted of bands that ranged from 20–30 or 25–100 members and were usually nomadic.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohem198-208/&gt; These bands were formed by several families. Bands sometimes joined together into larger "macrobands" for activities such as acquiring mates and celebrations or where resources were abundant.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; By the end of the Paleolithic era ({{c.|10,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP), people began to settle down into permanent locations, and began to rely on agriculture for sustenance in many locations. Much evidence exists that humans took part in long-distance trade between bands for rare commodities (such as [[ochre]], which was often used for religious purposes such as ritual&lt;ref name=Henahan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/SU/caveart.html |title=Blombos Cave art |accessdate=2008-03-12 |author=Sean Henahan |work=Science News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felipe Fernandez Armesto 2003 400"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ideas that changed the world|author=Felipe Fernandez Armesto|publisher=Dorling Kindersley limited|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7566-3298-4|location=Newyork|page=400|doi=|oclc=}}; [https://books.google.com/books?id=tFIAAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ideas+that+changed+the+world+by+Felipe+Fernandez+Armesto]&lt;/ref&gt;) and raw materials, as early as 120,000 years ago in Middle Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="Hillary Mayell" /&gt; Inter-band trade may have appeared during the Middle Paleolithic because trade between bands would have helped ensure their survival by allowing them to exchange resources and commodities such as raw materials during times of relative scarcity (i.e. famine, drought).&lt;ref name="Hillary Mayell"/&gt; Like in modern hunter-gatherer societies, individuals in Paleolithic societies may have been subordinate to the band as a whole.&lt;ref name="Leften Stavrianos"&gt;{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eamHPkIkE1UC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=paleolithic+society |title=Lifelines from Our Past: A New World History| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=M.E.

Some Upper Paleolithic societies in resource-rich environments (such as societies in [[Sungir]], in what is now Russia) may have had more complex and hierarchical organization (such as [[tribe]]s with a pronounced hierarchy and a somewhat formal [[division of labor]]) and may have engaged in [[endemic warfare]].&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Raymond C. Warless societies and the origin of war. Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there was no formal leadership during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Like contemporary egalitarian hunter-gatherers such as the [[Mbuti#Political structure|Mbuti]] pygmies, societies may have made decisions by communal [[consensus decision making]] rather than by appointing permanent rulers such as chiefs and [[monarch]]s.&lt;ref name="Kusimba 2003 285"/&gt; Nor was there a formal [[division of labor]] during the Paleolithic. Each member of the group was skilled at all tasks essential to survival, regardless of individual abilities. Theories to explain the apparent egalitarianism have arisen, notably the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[primitive communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Communist Manifesto |first=Karl |last=Marx |url= https://books.google.com/?id=TiKKmyacAiAC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;vq=Primitive+communism|author2=Friedrich Engels |year=1848 |location=London |page=87 |isbn=978-1-59986-995-7 }} Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, Stephen Henry (1999).

Kelly speculates that the relative peacefulness of Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies resulted from a low population density, cooperative relationships between groups such as reciprocal exchange of commodities and collaboration on hunting expeditions, and because the invention of projectile weapons such as throwing spears provided less incentive for war, because they increased the damage done to the attacker and decreased the relative amount of territory attackers could gain.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt; However, other sources claim that most Paleolithic groups may have been larger, more complex, sedentary and warlike than most contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, due to occupying more resource-abundant areas than most modern hunter-gatherers who have been pushed into more marginal habitats by agricultural societies.&lt;ref name=Kiefer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suluarchipelago.com/E20Website2002/default.htm|title=Anthropology E-20|accessdate=2008-03-11 |author=Thomas M.

Anthropologists have typically assumed that in Paleolithic societies, women were responsible for gathering wild plants and firewood, and men were responsible for hunting and scavenging dead animals.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt; However, analogies to existent hunter-gatherer societies such as the [[Hadza people]] and the [[Aboriginal Australians]] suggest that the sexual division of labor in the Paleolithic was relatively flexible.

Early examples of artistic expression, such as the [[Venus of Tan-Tan]] and the patterns found on [[elephant]] bones from [[Bilzingsleben (Paleolithic site)|Bilzingsleben]] in [[Thuringia]], may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'' prior to the start of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period.

Lower Paleolithic [[Acheulean]] tool users, according to Robert G. Bednarik, began to engage in symbolic behavior such as art around 850,000&amp;nbsp;BP. They decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic, rather than utilitarian qualities.&lt;ref name=Bednarik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/frontline/bednarik.htm |title=Beads and the origins of symbolism |author=Robert G.

The "Venus" figurines have been theorized, not universally, as representing a [[mother goddess]]; the abundance of such female imagery has inspired the theory that Paleolithic (and later Neolithic) societies centered their religion and societies around women. Adherents of the theory include archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] and [[feminist]] scholar [[Merlin Stone]], the author of the 1976 book ''[[When God Was a Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=Merlinstone&gt;{{cite book |title=When God Was a Woman |author=Merlin Stone.

===Music===
The origins of music during the Paleolithic are unknown. The earliest forms of music probably did not use musical instruments other than the human voice or natural objects such as rocks. This early music would not have left an archaeological footprint.  Music may have developed from rhythmic sounds produced by daily chores, for example, cracking open nuts with stones. Maintaining a rhythm while working may have helped people to become more efficient at daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bücher. '''Trabajo y ritmo'''. Biblioteca Científico-Filosófica, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative theory originally proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] explains that music may have begun as a hominin mating strategy. Bird and other animal species produce music such as calls to attract mates.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. '''The origin of man'''. Edimat books, S. A. {{ISBN|84-8403-034-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is generally less accepted than the previous hypothesis, but nonetheless provides a possible alternative.

[[Upper Paleolithic]] (and possibly [[Middle Paleolithic]])&lt;ref name="BoneAge"&gt;Nelson, D.E., ''Radiocarbon dating of bone and charcoal from Divje babe I cave'', cited by Morley, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; humans used [[flute]]-like bone pipes as musical instruments,&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahn, Paul 1996"&gt;Bahn, Paul (1996) "The atlas of world archeology" Copyright 2000 The Brown Reference Group PLC&lt;/ref&gt; and music may have played a large role in the religious lives of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. As with modern hunter-gatherer societies, music may have been used in ritual or to help induce [[trance]]s. In particular, it appears that animal skin [[drum]]s may have been used in religious events by Upper Paleolithic shamans, as shown by the remains of drum-like instruments from some Upper Paleolithic graves of shamans and the [[ethnography|ethnographic]] record of contemporary hunter-gatherer shamanic and ritual practices.&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-3"/&gt;

According to James B. Harrod humankind first developed [[religion|religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] or [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/aboutornet1.html |title=About OriginsNet by James Harrod |publisher=Originsnet.org |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial scholars of prehistoric religion and anthropology, James Harrod and Vincent W. Fallio, have recently proposed that religion and spirituality (and art) may have first arisen in Pre-Paleolithic chimpanzees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originsnet.org/chimpspiritdatabase.pdf |title=Appendices for chimpanzee spirituality by James Harrod |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527230019/http://www.originsnet.org/chimpspiritdatabase.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Early [[Lower Paleolithic]] ([[Oldowan]]) societies.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsnet.org/mindold.html |title=Oldowan Art, Religion, Symbols, Mind by James Harrod |publisher=Originsnet.org |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fallio, the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans experienced altered states of consciousness and partook in ritual, and ritual was used in their societies to strengthen social bonding and group cohesion.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt;

Middle Paleolithic humans' use of burials at sites such as [[Krapina]], Croatia ({{c.|130,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) and [[Qafzeh]], Israel ({{c.|100,000|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;BP) have led some anthropologists and archaeologists, such as [[Philip Lieberman]], to believe that Middle Paleolithic humans may have possessed a belief in an [[afterlife]] and a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".&lt;ref name=Lieberman/&gt; Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites, such as Combe-Grenal and Abri Moula in France, suggest that the [[Neanderthal#Cannibalism or ritual defleshing.3F|Neanderthals]]—like some contemporary human cultures—may have practiced [[excarnation|ritual defleshing]] for (presumably) religious reasons. According to recent archaeological findings from ''Homo heidelbergensis'' sites in [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]], humans may have begun burying their dead much earlier, during the late [[Lower Paleolithic]]; but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community.

Likewise, some scientists have proposed that Middle Paleolithic societies such as Neanderthal societies may also have practiced the earliest form of [[totemism]] or [[animal worship]], in addition to their (presumably religious) burial of the dead. In particular, Emil Bächler suggested (based on archaeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a [[bear]] [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was widespread among Middle Paleolithic [[Neanderthal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wunn, Ina (2000). "Beginning of Religion", Numen, '''47'''(4), pp. 434–435&lt;/ref&gt; A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship {{c.|70,000}}&amp;nbsp;BCE originates from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert has been denied by the original investigators of the site.&lt;ref name="Robbins et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Lawrence H.|author2=AlecC.

Narr |title=Prehistoric religion |accessdate=2008-03-28 |work=Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic was intertwined with hunting rites.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt; For instance, archaeological evidence from art and bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently involved a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism, in which a bear was sliced with [[arrow]]s, finished off by a blast in the [[lung]]s, and ritualistically worshipped near a clay bear statue covered by a bear fur with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately.&lt;ref name="Narr"/&gt; Barbara Ehrenreich controversially theorizes that the sacrificial hunting rites of the Upper Paleolithic (and by extension Paleolithic cooperative big-game hunting) gave rise to war or warlike raiding during the following [[Epipaleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] or late Upper Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="Barbara Ehrenreich"/&gt;

The existence of anthropomorphic images and half-human, half-animal images in the Upper Paleolithic may further indicate that [[Upper Paleolithic]] humans were the first people to believe in a [[Polytheism|pantheon of gods or supernatural beings]],&lt;ref name="mithen"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Steve Mithen|isbn=0-500-05081-3| title=The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science| year=1996| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| author=Steven Mithen}}&lt;/ref&gt; though such images may instead indicate shamanistic practices similar to those of contemporary tribal societies.&lt;ref name="Clottes"/&gt; The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman (and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices) dates back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] era ({{c.|30,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP) in what is now the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Tedlock/&gt; However, during the early Upper Paleolithic it was probably more common for all members of the band to participate equally and fully in religious ceremonies, in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos"/&gt; Additionally, it is also possible that Upper Paleolithic religions, like contemporary and historical [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, believed in the existence of a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as animistic spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From earth spirits to sky gods Socioecological Origins of Monotheism|last= Lerro |first=Bruce |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qs5RqLdx1HgC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=Paleolithic |year=2000 |publisher=Lexington Press |location= Lanham MD |isbn=0-7391-0098-X |page=327 }} pages 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent W. Fallio writes that [[ancestor worship|ancestor cults]] first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies. He argues that the elites of these societies (like the elites of many more contemporary complex hunter-gatherers such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies, by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that also gives them control over the earthly realm.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt; [[Secret societies]] may have served a similar function in these complex quasi-[[theocratic]] societies, by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the separate spheres of [[folk religion]] and [[elite religion]].&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"/&gt;

Religion was possibly [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]]; specifically, it may have involved [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt; The [[Venus figurines]], which are abundant in the Upper Paleolithic archaeological record, provide an example of possible Paleolithic sympathetic magic, as they may have been used for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have sometimes been explained as depictions of an [[earth goddess]] similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], or as representations of a goddess who is the ruler or mother of the animals.&lt;ref name=Narr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L.

For example, humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the Middle Paleolithic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]]. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as [[New Guinea]] and [[Alaska]], and adapting their diets to whatever local resources were available.

Another view is that until the Upper Paleolithic, humans were [[frugivore]]s (fruit eaters) who supplemented their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and [[mussel]]s, and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as [[antelope]]s.&lt;ref name=HartSussman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly [[chimpanzee]]s. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically, sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally very similar to that of humans.&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic_com&gt;{{cite news|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|title=Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimpanzees are primarily [[frugivore]]s, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% [[Plant-based diet|plant-based]], with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals.&lt;ref&gt;

Anthropologists have diverse opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed. Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers, there were many varied "diets"—in different groups—and also varying through this vast amount of time.

[[File:Quivira-Whitetail-Buck.jpg|thumb|Large game animals such as deer were an important source of protein in Middle and Upper Paleolithic diets.]]
People during the Middle Paleolithic, such as the Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa, began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and in Middle Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' sites at [[Pinnacle Point]], Africa around 164,000&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES/10/08/07"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/science/18beach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science&amp;oref=slogin|title=Key Human Traits Tied to Shellfish Remains |work=New York Times|author=John Noble Wilford |accessdate=2008-03-11 | date=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fishing only became common during the [[Upper Paleolithic]],&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/11/1108_bonetool_2.html African Bone Tools Dispute Key Idea About Human Evolution] National Geographic News article.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fish]] have been part of human diets long before the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"/&gt; For example, the Middle Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' in the region now occupied by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] hunted large {{cvt|6|ft|m|adj=on}}-long [[catfish]] with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Miller2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA-2"/&gt; The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter-gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi-nomadic, which altered their social structures.&lt;ref name="Bahn, Paul 1996"/&gt; Example societies are the [[Lepenski Vir]] as well as some contemporary hunter-gatherers, such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]].

Anthropologists such as Tim White suggest that [[cannibalism]] was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, based on the large amount of “butchered human" bones found in Neanderthal and other Lower/Middle Paleolithic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-TVHr_XtDJcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=paleolithic+cannibalism|title= Once were Cannibals |work=Evolution: A Scientific American Reader|author=Tim D.

A modern-day diet  known as the [[Paleolithic diet]] exists, based on restricting consumption to the foods presumed to be available to anatomically modern humans prior to the advent of settled [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Dining: The Real Paleo Diet|url=http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/22/prehistoric-dining-the-real-paleo-diet/|website=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Polar climate}}

'''Polar [[meteorology]]''' is the study of the atmosphere of Earth's [[polar regions]]. 
Surface [[temperature inversion]] is typical of polar environments and leads to the [[katabatic wind]] phenomenon. The vertical temperature structure of polar environments tends to be more complex than in mid-latitude or [[tropical]] climates.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The collection of polar meteorology data started in 1893 with [[Fridtjof Nansen]] during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|North Pole expedition]]. One of the goals of the expedition was to make detailed meteorological and early oceanographic measurements. The measurements made from Nansen’s ship, which was named Fram, were used by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]] to develop the theory of the turning of surface flow with friction (the [[Ekman spiral]]).

 | zbl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
The [[Cold War]] acted as a catalyst for progress in polar meteorology. Balloon instruments along the northern borders of the US and Canada were used for [[atmospheric profiling]]. North America’s air defenses often used instruments carried on balloons to profile the Arctic. [[Nuclear submarine]]s, which the United States used as a defense mechanism, were equipped with upward looking [[sonar]]. The data were later declassified and  between 1958-1979 became the baseline for assessing the thinning of ice from the 1980s to the present day.&lt;ref name="Weatherly"/&gt; Russia also contributed highly accurate data between 1937 and 1991.

===Present day===
Today, submarine mapping and measurements have been drastically reduced. One classic way to measuring ice thickness is to drill a hole in the ice and analyze the ice obtained. There are also many more complex methods and devices dedicated to measuring and keeping track of weather conditions in polar areas. These include ice mass balance buoys, upward looking sonar from under-ice buoys, and satellites. Global warming has increased interest in polar meteorology. This is because most of Earth's snow and ice are in polar regions, and these areas are expected to be the most affected by the snow/ice-surface [[albedo]] feedback effect. Therefore, if increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration causes global warming, then polar regions should warm faster than other locations on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Guest | first = Peter | title = Climate Change - Introduction

==Topics of interest==

===Atmosphere sea ice/ocean interaction===
Interaction between the atmosphere, ice and ocean is confined to the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], which is mainly influenced by surface characteristics. In polar regions, these are sea ice roughness and sea ice concentration, which greatly influence surface temperature distribution. Wind speed and direction, the temperature of the air, and the location of the wind contact are other factors.&lt;ref name="Wegener"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wacker | first = U. | title = Polar Meteorology | work = | publisher = Alfred Wegener Institute | date = | url = http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/ | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070220022815/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/| doi = | accessdate = 01-10-2013 | dead-url = yes | archivedate =2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sea ice and wind have great impact on the atmospheric boundary layer, which is often used to measure conditions in polar areas.

=== Polar clouds and precipitation ===
The atmospheric portion of the hydrological cycle in polar regions plays an important role  in that:&lt;ref name="Wegener" /&gt;
* the balance of polar ice masses is inseparably linked to precipitation,
* clouds modify the [[radiation transfer]],
* the release of [[latent heat]] modifies the temperature of the air, hence circulations.

===Carbon dioxide and methane===
Carbon dioxide (C02) is of particular interest in polar meteorology because it affects the melting of sea ice. 
Human activity releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning oil, coal and natural gas.
A dozen pounds of Arctic sea ice disappears for every pound of carbon dioxide released. This highlights the heating power of carbon dioxide, which pumps 100,000 times more energy into our climate than was given off when the oil, coal or natural gas was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/climatesnapshot/arctic-death-spiral-leaves-climate-scientists-shocked-and-worried |title=Arctic "death spiral" leaves climate scientists shocked and worried |publisher=Vancouver Observer |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Arctic ice, currently at its lowest level in recent history, is causing more absorption. Prof Wadhams, in a recent BBC article, calculates that this absorption of the sun's rays is having an effect "the equivalent of about 20 years of additional CO2 being added by man". The Cambridge University expert says that the Arctic ice cap is "heading for oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts |first=Susan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19496674 |title=BBC News - Arctic ice melt 'like adding 20 years of CO2 emissions' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Methane]], a potent greenhouse gas, introduces a significant [[positive feedback]] as global warming leads to the retreat of vast permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere. As permafrost retreats, more areas become emitters of methane. Estimations of the [[methane emissions]] from northern swamps vary strongly due to (1) the extensive variability of methane emission between and within different swamp areas, (2) the very limited knowledge of these fluxes for various types of soils, and (3) the lack of representative data for vast areas like the enormous swamps, e.g., in Sibiria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/methane/ |title=Alfred Wegener Institute Methane |publisher=Awi.de |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407105301/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/polar_meteorology/methane/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances now allow sensors to directly measure turbulent methane fluxes from naturally emitting surfaces. A fast response methane sensor can also be installed in research aircraft, like the Polar 5 airplane of the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]].

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''R''}}|{{color|#900|''R''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''S''}}|{{color|#900|''T''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''T''}}|{{color|#900|''S''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''P''}}|{{color|#900|''P''}}|transparent}}
|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

===Special case: Donation game===
The "donation game"&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbe|first=Christian |author2=Martin A. Nowak |author3=Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of extortion in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games|journal=PNAS|date=April 2013|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6913–18|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6913.abstract|accessdate=25 November 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1214834110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6913H |arxiv=1212.1067}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit ''b'' at a personal cost ''c'' with ''b'' &gt; ''c''. Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! {{diagonal split header|{{navy (color)|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''}}|{{color|#900|-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|0}}|{{color|#900|0}}|transparent}}
|}

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed-bag exchange===
[[File:Prisoner's Dilemma briefcase exchange (colorized).svg|thumb|The prisoner's dilemma as a briefcase exchange]]
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas R. | last=Hofstadter| authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter | title= [[Metamagical Themas]]: questing for the essence of mind and pattern | publisher= Bantam Dell Pub Group| year=1985 | isbn=0-465-04566-9|chapter= Ch.29 ''The Prisoner's Dilemma Computer Tournaments and the Evolution of Cooperation''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was "closed bag exchange":
{{quote|Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.}}

In this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

The rewards matrix is
{| class="wikitable"
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Pair 1}}|{{color|#900|Pair 2}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:6em;" | {{color|#900|"Friend"&lt;br /&gt;(cooperate)}}

|}

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

The '''radiography of cultural objects''' is the use of [[radiography]] to understand intrinsic details about objects. This process can reveal various details about objects that are not visible to the naked eye. This information, which includes structural elements, aids [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] as they assess object condition and consider treatment plans. Radiography can also reveal previous compositions and earlier repairs.

== Use and precautions ==
[[Infrared]] and [[ultraviolet light]] are also useful tools to understand the intrinsic details of certain objects. However, x-rays tend to be more useful for denser objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcons.udel.edu/about/kress/examination-techniques-and-scientific-terms/x-radiography Art Conservation at the [[University of Delaware]] (2014).  X-radiography. Retrieved from artcons.udel.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of radiography is that it is not intrusive. Radiography does expose the object to [[radiation]], but these levels are low. In fact, they are much lower than the radiation levels required for medical x-rays. While technicians and staff conducting the x-ray must use protective gear, the object is not damaged during the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays. (n.d.) Retrieved from  webexhibits.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icdd.com/resources/axa/vol47/v47_01.pdf Schreiner, B., Frühmann, B., Jembrih-Simbürger, D. &amp; Linke, R. (2004).

[[Paints]] are produced with a variety of [[Chemical Elements|elements]]. Depending on how much these pigments absorb x-rays affects how clear or opaque they will appear in the radiograph, this is known as x-ray [[fluorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays.

An x-ray of the [[Ghent Altarpiece]], painted by [[Jan Van Eyck]], in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent]], [[Belgium]] revealed the structure and details of the large altarpiece’s painting scheme. The complete radiography of the [[altarpiece]] was conducted between 2010 and 2011 as part of a project largely funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust|Getty Institute]]. The x-rays and other technical information that was gathered were used to prepare conservation treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/#viewer/id1=40&amp;id2=0 Closer to Van Eyck: Rediscovering the Ghent Altarpiece (2011).

The Sampling Officials of the Amsterdam Drapers’ Guild, also known as the [[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]] or more simply as the Syndics, was painted by [[Rembrandt]] in 1662. An x-ray of the painting revealed that Rembrandt fine-tuned the composition several times, alternating the glances between the figures and slightly changing their positions before he settled on that is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Late Rembrandt - The Syndics, 1662|url = http://kpnrijksmuseum.com/destaalmeesters|website = KPN Late Rembrandt|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray analysis revealed alterations to the paint of a sixteenth century portrait that had been identified as a [[Bronzino]] portrait of [[Eleanor of Toledo]] at the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

X-rays can provide a better picture of [[plaster casts]] and other works that rely on internal supports. However, size and mobility can often affect whether or not radiography is an option for sculptural works. X-rays can also identify cracks and previous repairs to [[glass]] and [[ceramic]] materials, which is important for assessing the condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/xray.html Pigments through the Ages: X-rays.

In the x-rays of a wooden power figure at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], conservators discovered that there were hollowed out sections through the center of the sculpture that connected three filled cavities. Information about the network inside of these sculptures has aided curators as they research the function of these pieces. The findings have led to the use of radiography to compare power figures in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imamuseum.org/about/ima-magazine/spring-2010|title = The Songye X-ray Project|date = Spring 2010|accessdate = |website = IMA Magazine|publisher = [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiography of Textiles ==
X-rays can reveal information about layers of [[textiles]] and stitching patterns. For [[quilts]], for instance, different textile types and other materials are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-03/x-radiography-as-a-tool-to-examine-the-making-and-remaking-of-historic-quilts/ Hackett, J. (2011). X-radiography as a tool to examine the making and remaking of historic quilts. Victoria &amp; Albert Online Journal 3(Spring 2011). Retrieved from vam.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; These materials are often hidden in the finished quilt. Therefore, x-radiography can provide conservators with useful information. For other textiles X-rays can also provide conservators with information about [[dyes]] since metallic mordant has historically been used in the dye making process. Details about stitching patterns can also appear on x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/research-journal/issue-03/x-radiography-as-a-tool-to-examine-the-making-and-remaking-of-historic-quilts/ Hackett, J.

'''Reading Recovery''' is a school-based, short-term intervention designed for children aged five or six, who are the lowest achieving in [[literacy]] after their first year of school. For instance, a child who is unable to read the simplest of books or write their own name, after a year in school, would be appropriate for a referral to a Reading Recovery program. The intervention involves intensive one-to-one lessons for 30 minutes a day with a trained literacy teacher, for between 12 and 20 weeks.

Reading Recovery was developed in the 1970s by New Zealand educator [[Marie Clay]]. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Recovery is an application of [[Whole Language]] instructional principles in an attempt to address the needs of struggling readers.

== Description of the program ==

A combination of teacher judgment and systematic evaluation procedures identify those lowest-achieving children for whom Reading Recovery was designed. The lowest performing children (the bottom 5-20% depending on the context) are identified using the Observation Survey (Clay, 2002), a multi-faceted series of assessment tools covering early reading and writing. The Observation Survey has been standardized in the UK and US to determine its validity and reliability, however coefficients have not been reported. 
Once a child has been identified and referred to the Reading Recovery program, intervention is developed. The intervention is different for every child, assessing what the child knows and what s/he needs to learn next. The focus of each lesson is to understand and construct "messages"—to understand messages in reading and construct messages in writing—and to learn how to attend to detail without losing focus on meaning.

Daily 30 minute lessons are individually designed and delivered by specially trained teachers. Drawing from their training, Reading Recovery teachers make moment-to-moment decisions to support the child's learning. During each lesson, children read many little books. These include two to three familiar books, a rereading of the previous day's new book and the introduction and reading of a new story. Teachers take a [[running record]] of the previous day's new book to analyse the child's independence and reading behaviour. Children also compose, write and read their own messages or stories. Magnetic alphabet letters are used for sorting, to assist visual discrimination, and to look closely at how words work. Reading skills, including phonetic skills, are taught in the context of extended reading and writing by Reading Recovery teachers who have completed a year-long inservice education program that focuses on moment-to-moment responses to children's actions and behaviour.

The intervention goal is to bring children up to the level of their peers and to give them the assistance they need to develop independent reading and writing strategies. Once they are reading and writing at a level equivalent to that of their peers, their series of lessons is discontinued.

The intervention is not intended as an alternative to classroom teaching, but is complementary, to enable children to engage in their classroom program.

==Professional development for teachers ==

An essential component of the Reading Recovery program is the training of the teachers who provide the tutorial instruction. Reading Recovery teachers learn to observe, analyse, and interpret the reading and writing behaviours of individual students and to design and implement an individual program to meet each student's needs. Just as the Reading Recovery children engage in learning through social interaction with the teacher, Reading Recovery teachers engage in learning through social interaction with their colleagues and mentors to construct a view of learning and teaching that supports literacy development. Reading Recovery has one of the best professional development protocols in the field of beginning reading.

==Reading Recovery programs around the world ==

"Reading Recovery" has been disseminated around a number of English-speaking countries.  The phrase "Reading Recovery" is a registered trademark held by the Marie Clay Trust in New Zealand, with [[The Ohio State University]] in the US and [[Institute of Education|the Institute of Education]] (http://www.ioe.ac.uk/) in the UK.

'''Reading Recovery in Australia'''

Reading Recovery operates through state and territory departments of education as well as catholic education offices. These comprise:

* New South Wales (http://www.curriculumsupport.education.nsw.gov.au/earlyyears/reading/index.htm). 

In 2015, a report from the New South Wales Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Deborah  |last1=Bradford |first2=Wai-Yin |last2=Wan |date=2015 |title=Reading Recovery: A Sector-Wide Analysis |url=https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/publications-filter/reading-recovery-evaluation |publisher=Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, Department of Education, New South Wales, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;, concluded that Reading Recovery was largely ineffective, and should not be used for most children &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=20 December 2015 |title=Reading Recovery program used in 960 NSW public schools does not work |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/reading-recovery-program-used-in-960-nsw-public-schools-does-not-work-20151218-glqplg.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, in 2016, Reading Recovery lost its "mandated status" as part of the curriculum in NSW's more than 900 public schools, although individual schools may still opt to use it &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagshaw |first=Eryk|date=21 September 2016 |title=Reading Recovery: NSW government ditches 30-year-old, $55m a year program  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/reading-recovery-nsw-government-ditches-30yearold-55m-a-year-program-20160921-grkv1n.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A further consequence of this shift in policy is that, in 2017, the NSW Department of Education initiated a hiring program to recruit dozens of new literacy and numeracy experts to support teachers in "evidence-based professional learning", according to NSW Minister for Education, [[Rob Stokes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=30 December 2017 |title=New literacy teachers recruited as NSW government axes Reading Recovery  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/new-literacy-teachers-recruited-as-nsw-government-axes-reading-recovery-20171222-h09c5f.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Clinton Richard Dawkins''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS|FRSL}} (born 26 March 1941) is an English [[ethology|ethologist]], [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]], and [[author]]. He is an [[Oxford fellow|emeritus fellow]] of [[New College, Oxford]], and was the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for Public Understanding of Science]] from 1995 until 2008.

Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', which popularised the [[gene-centred view of evolution]] and introduced the term ''[[meme]]''. With his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), he introduced into [[evolutionary biology]] the influential concept that the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]].

Dawkins is known as an outspoken [[atheist]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this to 'agnostic' without first consulting the "atheist-consensus" as established on the talk page and its archives - thank you. --&gt;. He has claimed in interviews to be an [[agnostic]] about many matters of [[faith and rationality|religious faith, instead endorsing reason]]. He is well known for his criticism of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]]. In ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), he argues against the [[watchmaker analogy]], an argument for the existence of a [[God|supernatural creator]] based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a ''blind'' watchmaker, in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a [[delusion]].

Dawkins has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards, and he makes regular television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, his atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a [[public intellectual]].

== Background ==

=== Early life ===

Dawkins was born in [[Nairobi]], then in [[British Kenya]], on 26 March 1941.&lt;ref name="encycdotcom" /&gt; He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (''née'' Ladner; born 1916)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|title=My mother is 100 today.

=== Education ===

[[File:Oundlegreathall.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Hall, [[Oundle School]]]]

From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins attended [[Oundle School]] in Northamptonshire, an English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] with a distinct Church of England flavour,&lt;ref name="Darwin's child"/&gt; where he was in Laundimer house.&lt;ref name="Oundle2012b"&gt;{{cite web|ref=CITEREFOundle2012b |url=http://www.oundleschool.org.uk./extracurric/lectures.php |title=The Oundle Lecture Series |publisher=[[Oundle School]]|year=2012b|accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430063443/http://www.oundleschool.org.uk/extracurric/lectures.php |archivedate=30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Oundle, Dawkins read [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' for the first time.{{sfn|Dawkins|2015|p=175}} He studied [[zoology]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning ethologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]].

=== Teaching ===

From 1967 to 1969, he was an assistant professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing [[Vietnam War]], and Dawkins became involved in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]] demonstrations and activities.&lt;ref name="belief interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/people/dawkins.shtml |title="Belief" interview |accessdate=8 April 2008 |date=5 April 2004 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970 as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science]] at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by [[Charles Simonyi]] with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |title=Manifesto for the Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=13 March 2008 |last=Simonyi |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Simonyi |date=15 May 1995 |publisher=The University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205051240/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/charles-simonyis-manifesto.html |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims.html |title=Aims of the Simonyi Professorship |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206202718/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims.html |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that professorship from 1995 until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship.html |title=Previous holders of The Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=23 September 2010 |publisher=The University of Oxford |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131193825/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship.html |archivedate=31 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also has edited several journals, and has acted as editorial advisor to the ''Encarta Encyclopedia'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia of Evolution]]''. He is listed as a senior editor and a columnist of the [[Council for Secular Humanism]]'s ''Free Inquiry'' magazine, and has been a member of the editorial board of ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine since its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/editorial_board.html |title= Editorial Board |accessdate=22 April 2008 |publisher=The Skeptics' Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has sat on judging panels for awards as diverse as the Royal Society's [[Faraday Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Awards]],&lt;ref name="cv" /&gt; and has been president of the Biological Sciences section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In 2004, [[Balliol College, Oxford]], instituted the Dawkins Prize, awarded for "outstanding research into the ecology and behaviour of animals whose welfare and survival may be endangered by human activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/miscellany/dawkins/index.asp |title=The Dawkins Prize for Animal Conservation and Welfare |accessdate=30 March 2008 |date=9 November 2007 |publisher=Balliol College, Oxford|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912192317/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/miscellany/dawkins/index.asp |archivedate =12 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, he retired from his professorship, announcing plans to "write a book aimed at youngsters in which he will warn them against believing in 'anti-scientific' fairytales."&lt;ref name="telegraph2008"&gt;{{cite news| title=Harry Potter fails to cast spell over Professor Richard Dawkins| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=1 November 2008|author1=Beckford, Martin  |author2=Khan, Urmee  |lastauthoramp=yes | location=London| date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology===
{{further|Gene-centred view of evolution}}

[[File:Dawkins at UT Austin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|At the [[University of Texas at Austin]], March 2008]]

Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the [[gene]] as the principal [[unit of selection]] in [[evolution]]; this view is most clearly set out in his books:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think : Reflections by Scientists, Writers, and Philosophers| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lH4sh2436rEC&amp;q=%22evolutionary+biologist%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22evolutionary%20biologist%22&amp;f=false| year=2007| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-921466-2| page=228| first1=Mark| last1=Ridley }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Lloyd| first=Elisabeth Anne| title=The structure and confirmation of evolutionary theory| url=https://books.google.com/?id=hO8vHTSiBkAC| year=1994| publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=978-0-691-00046-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), in which he notes that "all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities".
* ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), in which he describes [[natural selection]] as "the process whereby [[DNA replication|replicators]] out-propagate each other". He introduces to a wider audience the influential concept he presented in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |title=Replicator Selection and the Extended Phenotype |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |date=1978 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1978.tb01823.x |pmid=696023}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms. Dawkins regarded the extended phenotype as his single most important contribution to evolutionary biology and he considered [[niche construction]] to be a special case of extended phenotype. The concept of extended phenotype helps explain evolution, but it does not help predict specific outcomes.&lt;ref name="esf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090119081333.htm |title=European Evolutionary Biologists Rally Behind Richard Dawkins's Extended Phenotype |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This behaviour appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] used gene-frequency analysis in his [[inclusive fitness]] theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W.D. |authorlink=W.

Similarly, [[Robert Trivers]], thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of [[reciprocal altruism]], whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trivers |first=Robert |title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–57 |year=1971|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins popularised these ideas in ''The Selfish Gene'', and developed them in his own work.&lt;ref name="dawkins79"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=Twelve Misunderstandings of Kin Selection |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=51 |pages=184–200 |year=1979|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/writings/Twelve%20Misunderstandings%20of%20Kin%20Selection.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529180009/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/writings/Twelve%20Misunderstandings%20of%20Kin%20Selection.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1979.tb00682.x|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist [[E.

Critics of Dawkins's biological approach suggest that taking the [[gene]] as the unit of ''selection'' (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading. The gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of ''evolution'' (the long-term changes in [[allele]] frequencies in a population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dover| first=Gabriel| title=Dear Mr Darwin| year=2000| publisher=London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| isbn=978-0-7538-1127-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Selfish Gene'', Dawkins explains that he is using [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s definition of the gene as "that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Williams| first=George C.| title=Adaptation and Natural Selection| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wWZEq87CqO0C| year=1966| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=United States| isbn=978-0-691-02615-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common objection is that a gene cannot survive alone, but must cooperate with other genes to build an individual, and therefore a gene cannot be an independent "unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mayr| first=Ernst| authorlink=Ernst Mayr| title=What Evolution Is| year=2000| publisher=Basic Books| isbn=978-0-465-04426-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Extended Phenotype'', Dawkins suggests that from an individual gene's viewpoint, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted.

Advocates for higher levels of selection (such as [[Richard Lewontin]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], and [[Elliott Sober]]) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain.

When asked if [[Neo-Darwinism|Darwinism]] informs his everyday apprehension of life, Dawkins says, "In one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide open to the extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," implying that he feels that individual human beings can opt out of the survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the [[consciousness]] of self.&lt;ref name="strident" /&gt;

=== Fathering the meme ===
{{Main|Meme}}

In his book ''The Selfish Gene'', Dawkins [[neologism|coined]] the word ''meme'' (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes.{{sfn|Dawkins|1989|p=11}} It was intended as an extension of his "replicators" argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Susan Blackmore]]. These popularisations then led to the emergence of [[memetics]], a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999 | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–104 | doi = 10.1162/POSC_a_00057 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's ''meme'' refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of [[cultural evolution]] based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kelly |first=Kevin | title = Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World| year = 1994| publisher = Addison-Wesley| location = United States| isbn = 978-0-201-48340-6| page = 360 |title-link=Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dawkins invented the term ''meme'', he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist [[Richard Semon]].&lt;ref name="mneme"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurent also found the use of the term ''mneme'' in [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Life of the White Ant'' (1926), and Maeterlinck himself stated that he obtained the phrase from Semon's work.&lt;ref name=mneme/&gt; In his own work, Maeterlinck tried to explain memory in termites and ants by claiming that neural memory traces were added "upon the individual mneme".&lt;ref name="leiden"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[James Gleick]] describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as "his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his [[The Selfish Gene|selfish gene]]s or his later proselytising against religiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = James |last=Gleick | title = The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood| date = 15 February 2011| publisher = Pantheon| isbn = 978-0-375-42372-7| page = 269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundation ===

In 2006, Dawkins founded the ''Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science'' (''RDFRS''), a [[non-profit organisation]]. RDFRS financed research on the [[psychology of religion|psychology of belief and religion]], financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported [[charitable organisation]]s that are [[secularity|secular]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |title=Our Mission |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |accessdate=17 November 2006 |publisher=Richard Dawkins Foundation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061117150429/http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |archivedate =17 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, it was announced that the foundation was merging with the [[Center for Inquiry]], with Dawkins becoming a member of the new organization's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/atheism/richard-dawkins-atheist-organization-merges-with-center-for-inquiry |title = Richard Dawkins' Atheist Organization Merges with Center for Inquiry |date=26 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |website =WorldReligionNews.com |publisher = |last = Lesley |first = Alison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of religion ===

[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|Lecturing on his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 24 June 2006]]

Dawkins was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. After learning about Darwinism and the scientific reason why living things look as though they have been designed, Dawkins lost the remainder of his religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/46566/atheist_richard_dawkins_on_'the_god_delusion' |title=Atheist Richard Dawkins on 'The God Delusion' |accessdate=30 December 2012 |last=McNally |first=Terrence |date=17 January 2007 |publisher=alternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilized world could still be so uneducated in biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/178/story_17889_2.html |title=The Problem with God: Interview with Richard Dawkins (2) |accessdate=11 April 2008 |last=Sheahen |first=Laura |date=October 2005 |publisher=Beliefnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins notes that some physicists use 'God' as a metaphor for the general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being who forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/transcript/dawk-frame.html |title=Interview with Richard Dawkins |accessdate=12 April 2008 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagrees with [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s principle of [[Non-overlapping magisteria|nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1555132-3,00.html |title=God vs. Science (3) |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=5 November 2006 |last=Van Biema |first=David |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that the [[existence of God]] should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}} Dawkins became a prominent [[criticism of religion|critic of religion]] and has stated his [[Antireligion|opposition to religion]] as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=282–286}} He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as "one of the world's great evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science A Religion?|publisher=The Humanist |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |date=1 January 1997 |accessdate=31 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his [[spectrum of theistic probability]], which has seven levels between 1 (100% certainty that a God or gods exist) and 7 (100% certainty that a God or gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he is a 6.9, which represents a "de facto atheist" who thinks "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there." When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9102740/Richard-Dawkins-I-cant-be-sure-God-does-not-exist.html |title=Richard Dawkins: I can't be sure God does not exist |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |first=John |last=Bingham |location=London |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201202/why-does-richard-dawkins-take-issue-agnosticism |title=Why Does Richard Dawkins Take Issue With Agnosticism? |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |work=Psychology Today |first=Christopher |last=Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, at the [[Hay Festival]] in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/10853648/Richard-Dawkins-I-am-a-secular-Christian.html |title=Richard Dawkins: 'I am a secular Christian' |newspaper=Telegraph |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that [[semen]] comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/richard-dawkins-islamophobic-berkeley-event-cancelled-islam-muslim-uc-university-california-a7860281.html|title=Richard Dawkins hits back at allegations he is Islamophobic after Berkeley event is cancelled}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/681453611906396160|title=Dawkins Twitter This is almost as impressive as the prescient knowledge that embryo starts as a blob, semen comes from the spine &amp; the sun sets in a marsh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/344419641101275137|title="Did Jesus exist?"

Dawkins has risen to prominence in public debates concerning science and religion since the publication of his most popular book, ''The God Delusion'', in 2006, which became an international best seller.&lt;ref name="michaelpowell"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/science/20dawkins.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=A Knack for Bashing Orthodoxy|newspaper=New York Times|first=Michael|last=Powell|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, more than three million copies have been sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages.{{sfn|Dawkins|2015|p=173}} Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural [[zeitgeist]] and has also been identified with the rise of [[New Atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |title=The rise of the New Atheists |publisher=CNN |first=Simon |last=Hooper |date=9 November 2006 |accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a [[delusion]]—"a fixed false belief".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=5}} In his February 2002 TED talk entitled "Militant atheism", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science.&lt;ref name="militant" /&gt; On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours.

==== Criticism of creationism ====

Dawkins is a prominent critic of [[creationism]], a religious belief that [[human]]ity, [[life]], and the [[universe]] were created by a [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creationism/|title=Creationism |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Laboratory, [[Stanford University]]|quote=a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who is absolute creator of heaven and earth.|accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; without recourse to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Scott| first = Eugenie C| authorlink = Eugenie Scott| title = Evolution vs. creationism: an introduction| date = 3 August 2009| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley, CA| isbn = 978-0-520-26187-7| page = 51| chapter = Creationism| quote = The term 'creationism' to many people connotes the theological doctrine of special creationism: that God created the universe essentially as we see it today, and that this universe has not changed appreciably since that creation event. Special creationism includes the idea that God created living things in their present forms... }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has described the [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as "a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/09/religion.schools1 |title=A scientist's view |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=9 March 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1986 book, ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', contains a sustained critique of the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the [[watchmaker analogy]] made famous by the eighteenth-century English [[theology|theologian]] [[William Paley]] via his book ''Natural Theology'', in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, ''blind'' watchmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |title=Book: The Blind Watchmaker |accessdate=28 February 2008 |last=Catalano |first=John |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415140851/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |date=1 August 1996 |archivedate =15 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|Wearing a [[scarlet 'A']] lapel pin, at the 34th annual conference of [[American Atheists]] (2008)]]

In 1986, Dawkins and biologist [[John Maynard Smith]] participated in an [[Oxford Union]] debate against [[A. E. Wilder-Smith]] (a Young Earth creationist) and [[Edgar Andrews]] (president of the [[Biblical Creation Society]]).{{Ref label|b|b|none}} In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would "give them this oxygen by the mere act of ''engaging'' with them at all". He suggests that creationists "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|p=218}} In a December 2004 interview with American journalist [[Bill Moyers]], Dawkins said that "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." When Moyers questioned him on the [[Evolution as theory and fact|use of the word ''theory'']], Dawkins stated that "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." He added that "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins |title=''Now'' with Bill Moyers |accessdate=29 January 2006 |last=Moyers |first=Bill |date=3 December 2004 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has opposed the inclusion of [[intelligent design]] in science education, describing it as "not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |title=One side can be wrong |accessdate=21 December 2006 |date=1 September 2005 |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author2=Coyne, Jerry  |lastauthoramp=yes |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been referred to in the media as "Darwin's [[Rottweiler]]",&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/sep/darwins-rottweiler |title=Darwin's Rottweiler |accessdate=22 March 2008 |last=Hall |first=Stephen S. |date=9 August 2005 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcgrath&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister|title=Dawkins' God : genes, memes, and the meaning of life|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-1405125383|page=i|edition=Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.

He plans to subsidise schools through the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/news/article641971.ece |title=Godless Dawkins challenges schools |accessdate=3 April 2008 |date=19 November 2006 |last=Swinford |first=Steven |work=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a supporter of the [[Great Ape Project]]—a movement to extend certain moral and legal [[rights]] to all [[Hominidae|great apes]]—Dawkins contributed the article 'Gaps in the Mind' to the ''Great Ape Project'' book edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]].

In 2009, he spoke at the party's conference in opposition to blasphemy laws, alternative medicine, and faith schools.

In 1998, Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books connected with the [[Sokal affair]], ''[[Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science]]'' by [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] and ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Intellectual Impostures]]'' by [[Alan Sokal|Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]]. These books are famous for their criticism of [[postmodernism]] in US universities (namely in the departments of literary studies, anthropology, and other cultural studies).&lt;ref name="postmodernism"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6689/full/394141a0.html |last= Dawkins |first= Richard |title=Postmodernism Disrobed |date=9 July 1998 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |accessdate= 15 April 2016 |volume=394 |issue= 6689 |pages=141–143 | doi=10.1038/28089 |bibcode= 1998Natur.394..141D }} For article with math symbols see [http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/dawkins.html this link].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of [[pseudoscience]] and [[alternative medicine]]. His 1998 book ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'' considers [[John Keats]]'s accusation that by explaining the [[rainbow]], [[Isaac Newton]] diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do "myths" and "pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dawkins| first = Richard| title = Unweaving The Rainbow| year = 1998| publisher = Penguin| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-618-05673-6| pages = 4–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Diamond (journalist)|John Diamond]]'s posthumously published ''Snake Oil'', a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Diamond| first = John| title = Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations| year = 2001| publisher = Vintage| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0-09-942833-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins states that "There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work."{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|p=58}} In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film ''The Enemies of Reason'', Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559468/New-age-therapies-cause-retreat-from-reason.html |title=New age therapies cause 'retreat from reason' |date=5 August 2007 |first=David |last=Harrison |work=The Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing a long-standing partnership with [[Channel 4]], Dawkins participated in a five-part television series, ''[[Genius of Britain]]'', along with fellow scientists [[Stephen Hawking]], [[James Dyson]], [[Paul Nurse]], and [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. The series was first broadcast in June 2010, and focuses on major, British, scientific achievements throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/01/dawkins_to_front_c4_science_series.html |title=C4 lines up Genius science series |date=27 January 2009 |first=Robin |last=Parker |accessdate=31 January 2009 |work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

=== Development ===
In October 2012, [[Pawan Kalyan]] agreed to act in a film produced by Sharrath Marar, the former CEO of [[MAA TV]], after completing work on [[Trivikram Srinivas]]' ''[[Attarintiki Daredi]]'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Sharath-Marar-to-produce-Pawan-Kalyans-next/articleshow/16756753.cms|title=Sharath Marar to produce Pawan Kalyan’s next|last=Pasupulate|first=Karthik|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816153344/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Sharath-Marar-to-produce-Pawan-Kalyans-next/articleshow/16756753.cms?|archivedate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the theatrical release of ''[[Dabangg 2]]'' (2012), producer [[Bandla Ganesh]] registered the title ''Gabbar Singh in Hyderabad'' at the Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber which fuelled speculations that this would be the remake of ''Dabangg 2'' and the sequel of ''[[Gabbar Singh (film)|Gabbar Singh]]'' (2012), which itself was the official Telugu remake of ''[[Dabangg (2010 film)|Dabangg]]'' featuring Kalyan, [[Shruti Haasan]] and [[Abhimanyu Singh]] reprising the respective roles played by [[Salman Khan]], [[Sonakshi Sinha]] and [[Sonu Sood]] in the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Will-Pawan-remake-Salman-Khans-Dabangg-2/articleshow/17694543.cms|title=Will Pawan remake Salman Khan’s Dabangg 2?|last=A.

[[Sampath Nandi]] was chosen to direct the film and Marar was announced to execute the film's production. At the same time, the film was reported to have a fresh storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Devi-Sri-Prasad-to-compose-tunes-for-Gabbar-Singh-2/articleshow/20699202.cms|title=Devi Sri Prasad to compose tunes for Gabbar Singh 2|work=The Times of India|date=21 July 2013|accessdate=16 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816153400/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Devi-Sri-Prasad-to-compose-tunes-for-Gabbar-Singh-2/articleshow/20699202.cms?|archivedate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides producing the film, Kalyan himself wrote the story and made it clear to his team that ''Gabbar Singh''{{'s}} sequel would be based on an original script and would not be a remake of ''Dabangg 2''. Considering the response generated by ''Attarintiki Daredi'' and the subsequent change in his on-screen image, Kalyan put the pre-production activities on hold and made changes to the script. Some elements of family drama were added and the aggression and expressions of the lead character were toned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/south-masala/Total-makeover/articleshow/24673057.cms|title=Total makeover|last=Kamal|first=S.

A '''science project''' is an [[education]]al activity for students involving [[experiment]]s or construction of models in one of the science disciplines. Students may present their science project at a [[science fair]], so they may also call it a science fair project. Science projects may be classified into four main types. Science projects are done by students worldwide.

==Experimental projects==

Experimental projects, also known as investigatory projects, start with a question (AKA a hypothesis), use the [[scientific method]] to complete the research, and end with a report detailing the results and conclusions and an abstract.

==Engineering projects==

Engineering projects, also known as technology projects, start with a design of a machine or mechanical structure with the purpose of improving strength or performance. Researchers implement all their design ideas in a model they construct. The model will be tested to evaluate the design.

==Display projects==
[[File:Guatemalan Boy and His Science Project.jpg|alt=A boy holding a three-dimensional display of the planets in the solar system|thumb|This student is carrying his science project to school.]]

Display projects involve a creative assembly of a [[display board]] and construction of a model to show a visual representation of a larger fact. Making a model of the [[solar system]], a house, or of a simple [[Electrical network|electric circuit]] are considered display projects. Display boards are used to enhance the presentation. A [[tablet computer]] can be attached to the display board to make interactive display boards.

==Theoretical projects==

Theoretical projects may involve the same format as experimental or engineering projects. However, for
several possible reasons, such as lack of feasibility due to costs, the actual experiment is not performed.

Н. Н. Семёнова, Москва, учреждение Российской академии наук}}), was established in 1931 under the direction of Professor [[Nikolay Semyonov]], Nobel Laureate in Chemistry (1956) on the basis of the Physico-Chemical Sector of the Leningrad Physical Technical Institute ([[Ioffe Institute]]). The staff of the Institute includes about 450 researchers. The Institute has been situated in Moscow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/4523439/N-N-Semenov-Institute-of-Chemical-Physics-of-Russian-Academy-of-Sciences |title=N.N.Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences Moscow |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1943. It is affiliated with the [[Moscow State University]] and has chairs at the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] and other institutions of higher education. 

The Institute's aim has been defined as "the implementation of physical theories and methods into chemistry, chemical industry and some other branches of national economy". Its main areas of scientific inquiry are the kinetics and mechanism of chemical reactions, catalysis of chemical reactions, theory and dynamics of elementary processes, physics and chemistry of solids, structure and properties of polymers and composites, fundamentals of  polymerization processes, physics and chemistry of combustion, shock waves and detonation.

In 1956, a branch of the Institute of Chemical Physics was established in [[Chernogolovka]]; this was reorganized in 1997 as the independent [[Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics]] (IPCP RAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icp.ac.ru/eng/index.html |title=Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics RAS |publisher=Icp.ac.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185332/http://www.icp.ac.ru/eng/index.html |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another department of the Semenov Institute was reorganized in 1994 as the N.

'''Slow science''' is part of the broader [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]]. It is based on the belief that [[science]] should be a slow, steady, methodical process, and that scientists should not be expected to provide "quick fixes" to society's problems. Slow science supports [[curiosity]]-driven [[Scholarly method|scientific research]] and opposes [[Performance measurement|performance targets]].

[[Social media]] played a predominant role in shaping the course of major events leading up to, during, and after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]]. It enabled people to have a greater interaction with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;political landscape, controversies, and news surrounding the candidates involved. Unlike traditional news platforms, such as&amp;nbsp;newspapers, radio, and magazines, social media gave people the ability to share, comment, and post below a candidate's advertisement, news surrounding the candidates, or articles regarding the policy of the candidates. This accessibility, in turn, would have a great influence on the events that ultimately led to its outcome.

Candidates would often use multiple social media accounts, such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Snapchat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2009/10/19/social-media-local-politics/|title=How Local Politicians Are Using Social Media|last=Sternberg|first=Josh|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the digital architecture of each platform, candidates would post, create support videos, link to news articles, and challenge other candidates via fact-checking, discrediting, and response. In turn, users could share, like, or comment on these actions, furthering the candidates outreach. By doing so, candidates and users both would influence or change peoples views on a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/07/social-media-causes-some-users-to-rethink-their-views-on-an-issue/|title=Social media causes some users to rethink their views on an issue|date=2016-11-07|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With candidates using different combinations of these actions, they built a unique style of communication with the public, influencing the portrayal of themselves in the news, and in their own accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/18/election-2016-campaigns-as-a-direct-source-of-news/|title=Election 2016: Campaigns as a Direct Source of News [Pg. 2-3]|date=2016-07-18|website=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts then would help build electoral coalitions, which identify voters and, in turn, raise money. As a result, they ultimately aided in voter mobilization and electoral impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ten-ways-social-media-can-improve-campaign-engagement-and-reinvigorate-american-democracy/|title=Ten Ways Social Media Can Improve Campaign Engagement and Reinvigorate American Democracy {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-04-12|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from Stanford have found that 62% of U.S. adults get their news on social media and that people are more likely to believe in news favoring their choice of candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social networks&lt;ref&gt;H.Allcott &amp; M.Gentzkow (2017). Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 election. Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 31, Number 2—Spring 2017—Pages 211–236.

Throughout the campaign, candidates have debated over [[Immigration policy|immigrational]], [[Foreign policy|foreign]], [[Economic policy|economic]], [[Health policy|healthcare]], [[Criminal justice|criminal]], [[Domestic policy|domestic]], [[Education policy|educational]], [[Environmental policy|environmental]], and [[Electoral system|electoral]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/year-ahead-project/|title=The Big Issues Of The 2016 Campaign|date=2015-11-19|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using social media, they expanded their base further beyond the broadcast debates, both in the [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Democratic]] primary, and in the [[United States presidential debates, 2016|general election]].

==Background==
As the campaign began, analysts assumed that, because of the increased reach and capacity of social media sites of all kinds since the last election cycle, social media would be used in potentially powerful new ways. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' predicted that the use of campaign advertisements targeted at individuals using newly available data would be among the more notable innovations.&lt;ref name="AndrewsTargeted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/candidates-poised-to-spread-their-message-through-social-media-1438813048|title=Candidates Poised to Spread Their Message Through Social Media Ads|date=August 5, 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|last1=Andrews|first1=Natalie|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political newspaper, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', concluded not only that "[s]ocial media's influence in this presidential election is stronger than it has ever been," but that it "will shape campaigns for years to come."&lt;ref name="LangSocialMediaCircus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Marissa|title=2016 Presidential Election Circus: Is Social Media the Cause?|url=http://www.govtech.com/social/2016-Presidential-Election-Circus-Is-Social-Media-the-Cause.html|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', the "traditional media" and the Democratic and Republican parties have lost "dominance" of public opinion to the "digital revolution."&lt;ref name="PowersInfluencing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=William|title=Who’s Influencing Election 2016?|url=https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/who-s-influencing-election-2016-8bed68ddecc3#.jjwk3dcf1|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Speiser, co-founder of [[SocialFlow]], said, "This is the first true social media election." He added that before the 2016 presidential primaries, social media were a mere "auxiliary method of communication," but in this new era, "folks on social media to act on your behalf by just sharing it around. You don't have to buy access to reach millions of people anymore." According to Republican political strategist [[Patrick Ruffini]], in the 2012 election cycle, candidates would make short statements, and re-tweet or thank followers.&lt;ref name="LangSocialMediaCircus"/&gt; The candidates were able to use social media to get free advertising from their supporters. Attendees of political rallies would take photos with the candidates that would then be shared on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. This generates more visibility for the candidate at no cost to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=7993e5b9-0a6e-4600-8201-e885b8cfb0c5@sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=112057883&amp;db=f5h{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' compared [[Internet meme]]s to [[political cartoon]]s, arguing, "For the first time in a US election cycle, community-generated memes have grown to play a significant role in political discourse, similar to the classic printed cartoon." While an Internet meme is unlikely to destroy a political career, lots of memes targeting a candidate might.&lt;ref name="AlexanderZodiac"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Leigh|title=Blame it on the Zodiac killer: did social media ruin Ted Cruz's campaign?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/ted-cruz-campaign-social-media-memes-zodiac-killer|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump presidential campaign]] benefited from large numbers of supporters who were active on social media from the beginning of the campaign.
Donald Trump was perhaps one of the most provocative presidents in recent times, creating a strong divide within the country as there seemed to be very few people who felt only moderate feelings for him. With such a large divide created, it is no surprise that issues would arise on the Internet from both the supporters, who would call themselves "Centipedes" online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/reddit-and-the-god-emperor-of-the-internet.html|title=Opinion - Reddit and the God Emperor of the Internet|first=Christine|last=Lagorio-Chafkin|date=19 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liberals (who sometimes refer to each other as comrades online).

In the first [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican Presidential debate]], held on August 6, 2015, the moderator asked candidate [[Jeb Bush]] if he stood by a statement made the previous April that illegal entry into the U.S. by undocumented migrants is "an act of love."&lt;ref name="Fehrnstrom"&gt;{{cite news |last = Fehrnstrom |first =Eric |title= A punch-drunk Jeb Bush carries on |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/10/punch-drunk-jeb-bush-carries/AFJZk3IF7UwmOsd4jqMfIP/story.html|accessdate= February 25, 2016| work =Boston Globe |date= February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush replied that he did and the Trump campaign immediately posted his comment as part of a video showing mugshots of [[illegal immigrant]]s who committed violent crimes in the US, alternating with footage of Bush saying, "Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony…  It's an act of love."&lt;ref name="RichardsonActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Richardson|first = Bradford |title=Trump rips Bush over 'act of love' remarks on illegal immigration |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252325-trump-rips-bush-over-act-of-love-remarks-on-illegal|accessdate= February 24, 2016| work = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date= August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WarrenActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Warren|first =Michael |title= Trump Hits Jeb on 'Act of Love' |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/trump-hits-jeb-on-act-of-love/article/1023012|accessdate= February 24, 2016 | work = The Weekly Standard |date= August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Eric Fehrnstrom]], political analyst and media strategist, the video marked a crucial turning point in the campaign for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name="Fehrnstrom" /&gt; Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] regarded the ad as a key moment in Trump's political rise.&lt;ref name="BaroneActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Barone |first =Michael |title=The five key ingredients of Donald Trump's soaraway success |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12181094/The-five-key-ingredients-of-Donald-Trumps-soaraway-success.html|accessdate= March 23, 2016| work =The Daily Telegraph |date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' described the ad as pivotal in transforming [[Instagram]] from a personal photo-sharing app that some celebrities and politicians used to enhance their images, into a propaganda tool.&lt;ref name="GarafoliTool"&gt;{{cite news |last = Garafoli|first =Joe |title= Trump and Bush attack ads turn Instagram into a battleground |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Trump-and-Bush-attack-ads-turn-Instagram-into-a-6486213.php|accessdate= February 24, 2016| work = San Francisco Chronicle |date= September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Right Side Broadcasting Network]]'' frequently uploaded live streams of Donald Trump [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]] on [[YouTube]].

[[File:Twitter activity of Hillary Clinton.png|thumb|right|Twitter activity of Hillary Clinton from her first tweet in June 2013 to September 2017. Her tweet activity pattern has changed in 2015.]]

In April 2016, [[Correct the Record]], a pro-Clinton [[super PAC]], announced a program called "Barrier Breakers" intended to rival the largely online volunteer efforts of Sanders and Trump supporters. With $1 million in funding, Correct the Record employed paid staff described as "former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers" to post "exclusively positive content".&lt;ref name="HampsonOnline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampson|first1=Rick|title=Hillary Clinton, no fan of 'Bernie Bros,' could use their energy vs. Trump|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/12/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-social-media-supporters/84284322/|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', Cruz was "skewered by social media memes". His run for the Presidency was ended by a series of memes, including a [[viral video]] of an unusually awkward attempt to shake hands with his running mate [[Carly Fiorina]], which was edited to emphasize his awkwardness in reality. The video was viewed 3.5 million times online. In addition, a mock-[[conspiracy theory]] faux-asserted that [[Ted Cruz–Zodiac meme|Cruz was actually the Zodiac Killer]], an unidentified [[serial killer]] active in [[northern California]] from the late 1960s to the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="AlexanderZodiac" /&gt;

Jill Stein made extensive use of Twitter for her presidential campaign. She used the social media platform to communicate with Americans before, during, and after the presidential debate at Hofstra University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jill2016.com/stein_debate_hofstra|title=Jill Stein to Participate Real-Time in First Presidential Debate, Using Social Media to Take Her Case Directly to the American People|newspaper=Jill Stein 2016|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein used her Twitter influence in hopes that it would demonstrate a "changing political landscape" where voters weren't only faced with two options for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=26&amp;sid=d62e2beb-f245-456d-af8d-eebb894fb226@sessionmgr102&amp;hid=108&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=118300128&amp;db=a9h|title=Should You Vote for the Green Party?: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein was trending for the first time on Twitter the week of July 20, 2016 and gained 27,000 new followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jill2016.com/we_broke_internet|title=We broke the internet!|newspaper=Jill Stein 2016|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein also had the same idea as Gary Johnson to sway discouraged Bernie Sanders supporters to vote for her in the election.

'''''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''''' is a 2003 book by the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]], published by [[Joseph Henry Press]].&lt;ref name="jhp"&gt;Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first section of the book, Bailey discusses gender-atypical behaviors and [[gender dysphoria]] in children, emphasizing the biological determination of gender.  In the second section he deals primarily with gay men, including the link between childhood gender dysphoria and male [[homosexuality]] later in life. Bailey reviews evidence that male homosexuality is congenital (a result of genetics and [[Prenatal#Prenatal period|prenatal]] environment), and he argues for the accuracy of some [[stereotype]]s about gay men.&lt;ref name="Bailey76"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third section, Bailey summarizes evidence for a [[psychological typology]] of [[trans women]] that says there are two forms of [[transsexualism]] that affects transgender women: one that he describes as an extreme type of male homosexuality and one that is a sexual interest in having a female body, called [[autogynephilia]].

The book caused considerable controversy which led to complaints and a formal investigation by [[Northwestern University]], where Bailey was chair of the psychology department until shortly before the conclusion of the investigation. Northwestern ultimately found no basis for the complaints,&lt;ref name="Dreger2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Bailey’s sworn enemies had used every clever trick in the book—juxtaposing events in misleading ways, ignoring contrary evidence, working the rhetoric, and using anonymity whenever convenient, to make it look as though virtually every trans woman represented in Bailey’s book had felt abused by him and had filed a charge."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Some of the Worst Attacks on Social Science Have Come From Liberals|url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/when-liberals-attack-social-science.html|website = Science of Us|accessdate = 2016-01-01|date = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

''The Man Who Would Be Queen'' is divided into three sections: "The Boy Who Would Be Princess", "The Man He Might Become", and "Women Who Once Were Boys".

It starts with an anecdote about a child Bailey calls "Danny". Bailey writes of Danny's mother, who has been frustrated by other therapists she has seen about her son's "feminine" behavior.&lt;ref name="bailey16"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist [[Kenneth Zucker]]'s work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors.  Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe [[gender identity disorder]], a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as [[cross-dressing]]. For example, this class includes boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with [[toy car]]s and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.

The second section deals primarily with gay men, including a suggested link between childhood [[gender identity disorder]] and male homosexuality later in life. Bailey discusses whether homosexuality is a congenitally or possibly even genetically related phenomenon. This discussion includes references to Bailey's studies as well as those of neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] and geneticist [[Dean Hamer]]. He also discusses the behavior of gay men and its stereotypically masculine and feminine qualities.

In the third section, Bailey summarizes a taxonomy of transsexual women that was proposed by [[Ray Blanchard]] about fifteen years earlier. According to Blanchard, there are two types of transsexual women: one described as an extreme form of male homosexuality, the other being motivated by [[autogynephilia|a sexual interest in having a female body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Clemmensen | first2 = L.

==Reception==
The book elicited both strongly supportive and strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included the contents of the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to [[Benedict Carey]]'s story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of [[political correctness]] on [[academic freedom]]."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt; Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] argues that "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

However, critics such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]] think that the pointed criticism, including filing charges, was warranted: "Nothing we have done, I believe, and certainly nothing I have done, overstepped any boundaries of fair comment on a book and an author who stepped into the public arena with enthusiasm to deliver a false and unscientific and politically damaging opinion".&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;  The concern over academic freedom was dismissed by Charles Allen Moser, who wrote: "The death of free speech and academic freedom has been highly exaggerated. Science is not free of politics, never has been, and never will be."&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;

===Positive reactions===
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded: "Despite its provocative title, a scientific yet superbly compassionate exposition."&lt;ref name="napsales"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10530 The Man Who Would Be Queen] via [[National Academies Press]].

===Negative reactions from the transgender community===

The public response of members of the transgender community was almost entirely negative.&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; Among other things, they opposed the book's endorsement of [[Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory|Blanchard's taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]],&lt;ref name="klein2004"&gt;Klein, Julie M.

=== Negative reactions from outside the transgender community ===
Negative responses came from outside the transgender community as well. Liza Mundy of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' thought the book exceptionally dull despite the potentially interesting topic.&lt;ref name="mundy2003"&gt;Mundy, Liza (March 23, 2003). Codes of Behavior. ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Eli Coleman]] referred to the book as "an unfortunate setback in feelings of trust between the transgender community and sex researchers,"&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; and his colleague, Walter Bockting, wrote that it was "yet another blow to the delicate relationship between clinicians, scholars, and the transgender community."&lt;ref name="bockting2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bockting | first1 = Walter O. | year = 2005 | title = Biological reductionism meets gender diversity in human sexuality. [Review of the book The Man Who Would Be Queen.] | doi = 10.1080/00224490509552281 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 267–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] Director [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] said the book promoted a derogatory explanation of transgender identity that would hurt many vulnerable transgender people, and that the book, which was written in a [[popular science]] style, did not support the material in a scientific manner.&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; Psychologist [[Randi Ettner]] said of Bailey, "He's set back the field 100 years, as far as I'm concerned."&lt;ref name="klein2004" /&gt;

Originally, the [[Lambda Literary Award|Lambda Literary Foundation]] nominated the book as a finalist in the [[transgender]] award category for 2003. Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in just a few days. Under pressure from the petition, the Foundation withdrew the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004/03/16/3 |title = Group rescinds honor for disputed book |first = Patrick |last = Letellier |authorlink =  |date = 2004-03-16 |work = Gay.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505120340/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004%2F03%2F16%2F3 |archivedate = 2008-05-05 |accessdate = 2010-01-10 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Northwestern University professor of clinical medical humanities and [[bioethics]] [[Alice Dreger]] commented on Bailey's response to the negative reactions: "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but given the number of people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dreger | first1 = A. D.| title = Response to the Commentaries on Dreger (2008)| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 37| issue = 3| pages = 503–510| year = 2008| doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9348-7| url = http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/work/dreger/dreger_commentary_response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[Charles Allen Moser]], though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility."&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Charles Moser | title = A Different Perspective | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 |date=June 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9331-3 | pmid = 18431627 | pages=472–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations against Bailey===

==== Alleged lack of formal written consent in interviews ====
Two of the transsexual women in Bailey's book, two who mistakenly thought they were represented in the book, and several organizations have accused him of ethical breaches in his work by talking to them about their life stories without obtaining formal written consent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin. "Transsexual 'Subjects' Complain About Professor's Research Methods." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' 25 July 2003, Vol. 49, Issue 46. ''"The book contains numerous observations and reports of interviews with me", C. Anjelica Kieltyka, one of the transsexual women, wrote in a letter this month to C. Bradley Moore, Northwestern's vice president for research. She added: "I did not receive, nor was I asked to sign, an informed-consent document."''&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the people were aware that Bailey was writing a book about trans women at the time of the interviews: some of them read the drafts of the book before publication,&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; and several said they felt their stories had been told "accurately and sympathetically."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; Bailey has denied that it is unethical for a university professor to talk to people in the same manner that [[journalist]]s do, or to write books with the resulting anecdotes. He also stated that the book was "popular and not 'scientific'"  so it was not required to follow IRB rules.&lt;ref name="McCarthyism" /&gt;

According to Dreger, whether federal regulations required professors to obtain formal approval from a university [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) before interviewing people was uncertain at the time;&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; she points out that shortly after publication of this book, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], conducting interviews, collecting anecdotes, and similar activities do not constitute IRB-qualified research, and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules, when such work is "neither systematic nor generalizable in the scientific sense."&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{Cite book

==== Alleged practice of psychology without a license ====
Also as cited as harassment of Bailey were legal complaints that Bailey was [[practicing psychology without a license]]. The basis for these complaints was that [[sex-reassignment surgery]] in the US requires authorization letters from two psychologists, and Bailey had written a second letter, at no charge and upon request, for some individuals Bailey had spoken with while writing the book. American bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] notes that there was no legal basis for this claim, as Bailey received no compensation for his services, and was forthright in this letters about his qualifications, even attaching copies of his C.V: "Presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge, although you’d never know that from reading the press accounts, which mentioned only the complaints, not that they had petered out."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; State regulators took no action on these complaints.&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

The '''[[University of Michigan]]''' '''School of Information (UMSI)''' or iSchool in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] is a graduate school offering baccalaureate, magisterial, and doctoral degrees in [[informatics]] and [[information science]].

Its field of study is information: how it is created, identified, collected, structured, managed, preserved, accessed, processed, and presented; how it is used in different environments, with different technologies, and over time. The school's stated mission is: "We create and share knowledge so that people can use information -- with technology -- to build a better world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMSI Mission and History|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/aboutsi/history-and-mission|publisher=University of Michigan School of Information|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; " Its slogan is "connecting people, information, and technology in more valuable ways."

The School of Information is part of a growing [[list of i-schools]] devoted to the study of information as a discipline. These institutions have varied histories, some being newly created, others developing from earlier schools or departments focused on library and information science (as with SI), computer science, communications, or information technology. SI was the first of these institutions to relabel itself as a "school of information." It is currently housed in the North Quadrangle on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus.

In 2008, the School of Information, [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]] and the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] unveiled a new undergraduate major called [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]. In 2011, the School of Information and the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health|School of Public Health]] announced the creation of a master's degree in health informatics. In 2014, the School of Information enrolled its first students for a bachelor's degree in Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMSI plans new undergraduate degree|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221221859/http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|archivedate=2012-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the [[University of Michigan - Ann Arbor|University of Michigan]] has offered a bachelor's degree in [[informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]. Informatics is housed in the [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]] in cooperation with the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and the School of Information and gives students a solid grounding in information systems, statistics, mathematics and computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Informatics An interdisciplinary major at the University of Michigan - About|url=http://informatics.umich.edu/informatics/about|publisher=Informatics.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are able to specialize in one of five tracks: Social Computing, Data Mining &amp; Information Analysis, Computational, Internet, and Life Sciences. Depending on the track chosen, students are prepared for many career paths, including business, research, government, computer programming, education and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Informatics An interdisciplinary major at the University of Michigan - Curriculum|url=http://informatics.umich.edu/informatics/curriculum|publisher=Informatics.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the School of Information announced that it would begin to offer an undergraduate degree, with students pursuing this degree graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Information (BSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan School of Information - Undergraduate degree|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate-degre|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change, it was decided that the Social Computing and Computational tracks of the Informatics program would be phased out, with the final class of the degree graduating in May 2015, as the BSI program would be teaching similar concepts. In August 2014, the "First Class" of BSI students began their learning in this new program, under the direction of director John L. King. Students in this program complete a series of core courses and electives, as well as courses that allow them to graduate specializing in either ''Designing for the User Experience '' or ''Information Analytics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Requirements|url=https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/degree-requirements|publisher=Informatics.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary degree focuses on the social/behavioral and technological sciences. Students will takes classes in mathematics, communications, statistics and history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan School of Information - UMSI plans new undergraduate degree|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221221859/http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|archivedate=2012-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon graduation will successfully compete for jobs in science, business, government, education, technology, and entertainment. Graduates looking to continue their education are encouraged to continue their studies in graduate programs. Students graduating with a BSI have the tools and know-how for a successful future in companies and nonprofit organizations such as Facebook, Apple, Cisco, Microsoft, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Deloitte, Bank of America, Google, National Public Radio, and the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Outcomes|url=https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/career-outcomes|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High school students may apply to this program "preferred admission" when applying to The University of Michigan, or students already enrolled at The University of Michigan may apply to transfer into the program beginning in their Junior year. The goal of the BSI program is "To build a community of students who are diverse and multi-dimensional, self-starters who will contribute both in the classroom and in the field" and look for students with strong transcripts that reflect good grades and appropriate course selections, engagement with community and/or campus organizations, and demonstrated leadership capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSI Admissions|url=https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/bsi-admissions|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of this program will come out with at least 120 University of Michigan credits, at least 60 of which are upper level and of which 45 are offered by the School of Information. Three core courses are required for the program: ''Agile Web Development'', ''Models of Social Information Processing'', and ''Information Environments and Work'', and are supplemented with elective courses in topics such as graphic design, eCommunities, persuasion and social influence, cyberscience, and the history of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Requirements|url=https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-information/degree-requirements|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master's degree==
The [[Master of Science]] in Information (MSI) degree is a 48-credit hour professional degree built on a core curriculum of "foundations" courses that synthesize content and methodology from [[library and information science]], [[computer science]], the humanities, and the social sciences. Real-world engagement is a hallmark of the master's program: all students are required to complete [[internship]]s or [[mentorship]]s in the field.

The MSI program is highly interdisciplinary, featuring faculty from a wide range of academic fields. It draws students from diverse undergraduate majors, ranging from the arts and humanities to science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan School of Information - Master of Science in Information|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/what-msi/|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Master's students may specialize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/msi/msi-specializations |title=MSI specializations &amp;#124; University of Michigan School of Information |publisher=Si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following areas:
* Archives and Records Management (ARM)
* [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI)
* Information Economics for Management (IEM)
* [[Library and Information Science]] (LIS)
* Information Analysis and Retrieval (IAR)
* Preservation of Information (PI)
* [[Social computing]] (SC)
* School Library Media (SLM)

Students may also opt for a self-designed curriculum under the guidance of a faculty member.

In 2011, the School of Information and the [[University of Michigan School of Public Health|School of Public Health]] offered a new join graduate program in Health Informatics. The first class graduated in the Fall of 2012. Students in the Health Informatics program take 52 credits specializing in epidemiology, health management and policy, and health behavior and education from the School of Public Health, combined with the design and evaluation of effective information systems learned in the School of Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan School of Information - Opportunities in Health Informatics|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/mhi/opportunities-health-informatics|publisher=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral degree==
The school's doctoral program is a full-time course of study, typically four years post-baccalaureate, leading to the Doctor of Information (Ph.D.). The program is designed to enable students to engage in advanced study and research in a various information fields such as the economics of information, human-computer interaction, library and information services, organizational issues, archives and records management, new systems architecture, digital libraries, information systems management, and digital documents/digital publishing.

==Faculty and research==
Faculty at the school are drawn from an unusually wide range of academic backgrounds including [[linguistics]], [[public policy]], computer science, library and information science, management, law, business, economics, psychology, history, and communications.

The school's faculty and students are active in research, pursuing projects in various areas and methods. Their stated goal is to develop an integrated understanding of human needs in relation to information systems and social structures, searching for unifying principles that illuminate the role of information in computation, cognition, communication, and community.

The school's infrastructure includes a range of research facilities and equipment. Researchers also have access to a number of off-campus research sites. Projects are often collaborations with researchers from other units at the university.

==History==
Before 1992, the School of Information was the School of Information and Library Studies. In 1992, the president of the University of Michigan, James Duderstadt appointed [[Daniel E. Atkins III]] as the dean of the school. Under the direction of Dr. Atkins and with support from Duderstadt and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the school became the School of Information with the intent to reach beyond traditional library science arena. The School of Information was officially established in 1996 offering a master's of science in information with some specializations (library and information science, archives and record management, human computer interaction, information economics management and policy, and a tailored program).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Gary M. and Jonathan Grudin.

[[File:Pieter Janssens Elinga - Reading Woman - WGA7482.jpg|thumb|Elinga, ''Reading Woman,'' c. 1660]]
'''Women reading in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying one or more women in the act of reading. This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conlon|first=James|year=2005|title=Men Reading Women Reading: Interpreting Images of Women Readers|jstor=4137395|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=26|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. ''Reading Woman'' (c.1660) by [[Pieter Janssens Elinga|Pieter Janssans Elinga]] portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity.

Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, then, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Depictions of woman readers ==

[[File:Antoine_Wiertz_La_liseuse_de_romans.jpg|thumb|Antoine Wiertz, ''The Reader of Novels,'' c. 1853]]
During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Reader|last=Jack|first=Belinda|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=228–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties.  Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in [[Antoine Wiertz|Antoine Wiert's]]''The Reader of Novels'' (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Claude_Monet_-_Springtime_-_Walters_3711.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', c. 1872]]
In [[Dutch Golden Age]] painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. [[Johannes Vermeer]], for example, created numerous works around this subject, including ''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter|A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]''. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/teaching-packets/pdfs/dutch_painting.pdf|title=Painting in the Dutch Golden Age: A Profile of the Seventeenth Century|last=|first=|date=2007|website=National Gallery of Art, Washington|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conlon argues, the self-relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Vermeer,_Johannes_-_Woman_reading_a_letter_-_ca._1662-1663.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'', ca. 1662-1663, [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

== Female artists and the subject of reading ==

Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''Family Group Reading'' is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Wujing Zongyao''''' ({{zh|t=武經總要}}), sometimes rendered in English as the '''''Complete Essentials for the Military Classics''''', is a Chinese military [[compendium]] written from around 1040 to 1044.

The book was compiled during the [[Northern Song dynasty]] by [[Zeng Gongliang]] (曾公亮), Ding Du (丁度) and Yang Weide (楊惟德), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The compendium was published under the auspices of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]], who also authored the book's preface.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}}  The book covers a wide range of subjects, including everything from naval [[warship]]s to different types of [[catapult]]s. It contains the earliest known written chemical formulas for [[gunpowder]], made from [[saltpeter]], [[sulphur]] and [[charcoal]] along with many added ingredients.{{sfn|Ebrey|1996|p=138}}{{sfn|Chase|2003}}  In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium also contains details on various other gunpowder weapons such as [[fire arrow]]s, [[incendiary bomb]]s and projectiles, and [[grenade]]s and [[smoke bomb]]s.  It also describes an early form of the [[compass]] (using [[wikt: thermoremanent|thermoremanence]]), and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese [[Greek fire]] [[flamethrower]] with a double-action dual-[[piston]] cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=83}}

==History==
[[File:Renzong.jpg|thumb|Court portrait of [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]]]]
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' was compiled under the sponsorship of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] (r. 1022–1063 AD),{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}}, who was concerned that many officials were unfamiliar with the military classics,{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=99}} and partially as a response to the Song dynasty's war with the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s of [[Western Xia]].{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}} 

A team of scholars worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the ''Wujing Zongyao'' with the intent to collect all known military knowledge{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=19}} and to disseminate it to a wider government audience.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}} Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the [[astronomer]] Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du.{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=19}} After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}} Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, implying that the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was likely written for other government officials.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}}

Parts of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' were copied from older sources; historian Ralph D. Sawyer calls it "essentially a cut-and-paste job", containing many passages from earlier classical military writings whose original authors are left unidentified, a common practice at the time.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}} During the Song dynasty, the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was appended to two other books: the ''Xingjun xuzhi'' and the ''Baizhan qifa'', both written by anonymous authors.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' was one of 347 military treatises listed in the biographical chapters of the [[History of Song]] (1345 AD), one of the [[Twenty-Four Histories]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}} Of these 347 different military treatises from the Song period, only the ''Wujing Zongyao'', the ''Huqianjing'' (Tiger Seal Manual) of Xu Dong in 1004 AD, and fragments of similar works found in the later ''Yonglo Datian'', have survived.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}} The original text of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was kept in the Imperial Library while a number of hand-written copies were distributed elsewhere, including a copy given to Wang Shao by [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1069 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=19–20}}

The original copy of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was lost during the [[Jin–Song Wars|Jin–Song wars]] when the invading [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchens]] sacked the Northern Song capital of [[Kaifeng]] in 1126 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} Only a few manuscripts survived as a result of its secretive nature. Very few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} A remaining copy of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the [[Southern Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=21}} The entire ''Wujing Zongyao'' was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available.{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=20}} However, the historian [[Joseph Needham]] asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}}

After the ''Wujing Zongyao'' of 1510 was printed, other Ming copies were made. This included the [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing]] edition (1522–1566 AD), the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] edition (1573–1619 AD) of [[Quanzhou]], and the Wanli edition (1573–1619) of [[Jinling]] by Tang Xinyün (preserved by Cunjingge).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} During the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911 AD) it was also reprinted in two different editions during the 18th century, and again in 1934 with the [[Shanghai]] edition.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}}

The ''Xu Wujing Zongyao'' (續武經總要; literally "Continuation of Wujing Zongyao") is a "continuation" of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' written in the late Ming dynasty. The book focuses primarily on army formations and military deployments.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}} It was written by Fan Jingwen (1587–1644), who was then the Vice President of the Board of War (兵部尚書; ''bingbu shangshu''). Fan wrote the book because he felt that reprints of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' circulating at that time were out of date and did not take into account the technological and strategic changes that had occurred since the Song dynasty. The only surviving copy of the ''Xu Wujing Zongyao'' is held by [[Fudan University]] Library.{{sfn|Yates|2005|p=22}}

==Compass and navigation==

[[File:HKSM 香港太空館 Hong Kong Space Museum 指南針 compass Jan-2013.JPG|thumb|right|Model of a Chinese [[compass]] from the [[Hong Kong Space Museum]]]] 

In the 3rd century, the Chinese engineer [[Ma Jun]] invented the [[south-pointing chariot]]. This was a wheeled vehicle that employed [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] in order to lock a figurine of an [[Xian (Taoism)|immortal]] in place on the end of a long wooden staff, the figure having its arm stretched out and always pointing to the southern [[cardinal direction]]. Although the authors of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' were mistaken in believing that the design of the south-pointing chariot was not handed down (as it was reinvented during the Song period and combined with an [[odometer]]), they described a new device which allowed one to navigate. This was the 'south pointing fish' (a thermoremanence [[compass]]), essentially a heated iron (or preferably steel) object cut in the shape of a fish and suspended in a bowl of water. The ''Wujing Zongyao'' part 1 volume 15 text stated:

{{quote |
When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished, they let an old horse go on before to lead them, or else they made use of the south-pointing carriage, or the south-pointing fish to identify the directions. Now the carriage method has not been handed down, but in the fish method a thin leaf of iron is cut into the shape of a fish two inches long and half an inch broad, having a pointed head and tail. This is then heated in a charcoal fire, and when it has become thoroughly red-hot, it is taken out by the head with iron tongs and placed so that its tail points due north. In this position it is quenched with water in a basin, so that its tail is submerged for several tenths of an inch. It is then kept in a tightly closed box. To use it, a small bowl filled with water is set up in a windless place, and the fish is laid as flat as possible upon the water-surface so that it floats, whereupon its head will point south.{{sfn|Needham|1962|p=252}}
}}

Later on in the Song dynasty the compass was used with maritime navigation.{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=326}} Several decades after the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was written, the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by [[lodestone]], the thermoremanence compass fell out of use.{{sfn|Needham|1962|pp=252–253}} The later maritime author [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] wrote of the magnetic needle compass as a means to navigate at sea in his ''Pingzhou Table Talks'' of 1119 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1971|p=381}}{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=22}}

==Naval technology==

The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s illustrated descriptions of warships had a significant influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the ''Wujing Zongyao''. The use of pictures from the ''Wujing Zongyao'' would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's ''Ka-i Tsūshō-kō'' (Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians) in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's ''Wakan Senyōshū'' (Collected Studies on the Ships used by the Chinese and Japanese) in 1766.{{sfn|Needham|1971|p=381}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' divides Chinese warships into six categories: Tower ships (''lou chuan''), combat or war junks (''dou xian'' or ''zhan xian''), covered swoopers (''meng chong''), flying barques (''zou ge''), patrol boats (''you ting''), and sea hawk ships (''hai hu'').{{sfn|Turnbull|2002|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Needham|1971|pp=424–425}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s typology for classifying Chinese warships would reappear in later naval texts for many centuries.{{sfn|Turnbull|2002|p=15}}

===Gunpowder weapons===
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' records detailed descriptions of gunpowder weapons such as incendiary projectiles, [[smoke bombs]], [[fire arrows]], and [[grenades]]. It documents incendiary projectiles containing low-nitrate gunpowder,{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=73}} which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=70–71}} Examples of these incendiaries include the "swallow-tail" incendiary ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|燕尾炬}}; ''yanweiju'') and the flying incendiary ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|飛炬}}; ''feiju''). The swallow-tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow-tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a [[swape]] lever installed within the walls of the city.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=70–71}} The book also describes an 'igniter ball' used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The ''Wujing Zongyao'' stated the following:

{{quote |
The 'igniter ball' (''yin huo qiu'') is made of paper round like a ball, inside which is put  between three and five pounds of powdered bricks. Melt yellow wax and let it stand until clear, then add powdered charcoal and make it into a paste permeating the ball; bind it up with hempen string. When you want to find the range of anything, shoot off this fire-ball first, then other incendiary balls can follow.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=73}}
}}

Gunpowder was attached to fire arrows ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|火箭}}) and utilized as an incendiary.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=165}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' records that fire arrows were launched from bows or crossbows. The gunpowder used for fire arrows was likely a low-nitrate powder, and the quantity of gunpowder varied according to the type of bow.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=477}} In the book, the force of gunpowder is said to be enough to launch an arrow, but only when the elasticity of the crossbow is sufficient.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=166}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' discusses various types of incendiary bombs and grenades. They used a low-nitrate gunpowder that, while not powerful enough to cause an explosion, was effective for incendiary weapons. The ''huoqiu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|火毬}}; literally "fire ball") was filled with gunpowder and launched using a trebuchet. Upon impact, the ''huoqiu'' would start a fire among an invading army.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}} Chinese bombs such as the thunder clap bomb or ''pili pao'' used a greater percentage of gunpowder than that of the ''huoqiu''. The gunpowder mixture for a bomb was placed within a rigid container that held in the expanding gas, allowing for more powerful explosions. The thunder clap bomb was constructed with a container made from bamboo.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}}

In the ''Wujing Zongyao'' and other military texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the ''shoupao'', or hand bomb, which is analogous to the hand grenade.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}}

===Formulas===

Gunpowder had already been invented prior to the ''Wujing Zongyao'' by Chinese alchemists in the 9th century.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Early references to gunpowder can be found in the Daoist book ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaolue'', written circa 850,{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31}} and gunpowder was utilized in Chinese warfare as early as the 10th century in [[fire arrows]] and [[gunpowder]] [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]s used to light the Chinese two-piston [[flamethrower]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=80–82}} 

However it was not until the ''Wujing Zongyao'' that the exact chemical formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=177}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' contains three formulas for gunpowder:{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31}} one for an explosive bomb launched from a [[trebuchet]], another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for [[chemical warfare]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=117}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s first recorded gunpowder formula used in these bombs held a [[potassium nitrate]] level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and [[carbon]]aceous content of 23% to 25.2%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=120}} The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine.{{sfn|Wang|1947|pp=161–162}} Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}}

For the second formula, the inner ball alone had a nitrate percentage of 61.5% to 50.2%, a sulfur content of 30.8% to 25.1%, and if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 24.7%, if just taking the charcoal content alone, the carbon level was 7.7%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=122}} If the outer coating and inner ball are both included with the second black-powder formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 34.7% to 54.8%, a sulfur content of 17.4% to 27.4%, and if all carbonaceous material is used, 47.9% carbon, if only charcoal is used, 17.8%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=122}} If the inner ball of the third black-powder formula is only considered, it held nitrate levels of 39.6% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 49.4% nitrate if excluding the poisons, and 60% if charcoal is specified alone.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The sulfur content was 19.8% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 24.7% if this excluded poisons, and 30% if charcoal is specified alone.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The carbon content was 40.5% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 25.9% if this excluded poisons, and 10% if charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} If both the inner ball and outer coating are considered for the third formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 27% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 31.2% if this excluded poisons, and 51.7% if charcoal alone was used.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The sulfur content would be 13.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 15.6% if this excluded the poisons, and 25.9% if only charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}}  The carbon content was 59.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken into account, 53.2% if this excluded poisons, and 22.4% if charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}}

The first black-powder concoction was simply labeled as the "method for making the fire-chemical", with its ingredients and measured weight (in [[ounce]]s) of each ingredient listed in the section below with the others  listed in similar fashion.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=182}}

==Double-acting piston flamethrower==
[[File:Chinese Flamethrower.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Chinese [[flamethrower]] from the ''Wujing Zongyao'']]
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' describes a flamethrower with a double-acting two-[[piston]] cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.{{sfn|Gernet|1982|p=310}} The first Chinese battle to use the double-piston pump flamethrower was the [[Battle of Langshan Jiang]] in 919 AD. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River, 狼山江), the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' (huo yóu, 火油) to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=81}} [[Greek fire]] is likely based on distilled petroleum and is a weapon of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] origin.{{sfn|Turnbull|2001|p=40}} The Chinese author Lin Yu explained in his book of 919 AD that Greek fire was acquired from their [[Arab]] [[maritime trade]] contacts in the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=82}} Furthermore, the Chinese had been using the piston [[syringe]] since the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=84}} However, it was the later ''Wujing Zongyao'' that would provide the first illustrated drawing and greater textual explanation for how this flamethrower operated. In describing the drawn illustration of the flamethrower in the book, the ''Wujing Zongyao'' states:

{{quote | On the right is the [[petrol]] flamethrower (lit. fierce fire oil-shooter). The tank is made of [[brass]], and supported on four legs. From its upper surface arise four (vertical) tubes attached to a horizontal cylinder above; they are all connected with the tank. The head and the tail of the cylinder are large (the middle) is of narrow (diameter). In the tail end there is a small opening as big as a millet grain. The head end has (two) round openings 1½ inches in diameter. At the side of the tank there is a hole with a (little) tube which is used for filling, and this is fitted with a cover. Inside the cylinder there is a (piston-)rod packed with [[silk]] floss, the head of which is wound round with hemp waste about ½ inches thick. Before and behind, the two communicating tubes are (alternately) occluded (lit. controlled), and (the mechanism) thus determined. The tail has a horizontal handle (the pump handle), in front of which there is a round cover. When (the handle is pushed) in (the pistons) close the mouth of the tubes (in turn).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=82}}}}

{{quote | Before use the tank is filled with rather more than three catties of the oil with a spoon through a filter; at the same time gunpowder (composition) is placed in the ignition chamber at the head. When the fire is to be started one applies a heated [[branding iron]] (to the ignition chamber), and the piston-rod is forced fully into the cylinder—then the man at the back is ordered to draw the piston rod fully backwards and work it (back and forth) as vigorously as possible. Whereupon the oil (the petrol) comes out through the ignition chamber and is shot forth as blazing flame.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=83–84}}}}

Then the text goes on to provide further instructions about equipment, maintenance, and repair of flamethrowers:

{{quote | When filling, use the bowl, the spoon and filter; for igniting there is the branding iron; for maintaining (or renewing) the fire there is the container. The branding iron is made sharp like an [[wikt:awl|awl]] so that it may be used to unblock the tubes if they get stopped up. There are tongs with which to pick up the glowing fire, and there is a [[soldering iron]] for stopping up leaks. If the tanks or the tubes get cracked and leak they may be mended by using green wax. Altogether there are 12 items of equipment, all of brass except the tongs, the branding iron, and the soldering iron. Another method is to fix a brass [[gourd]]-shaped container inside a large tube; below it has two feet, and inside there are two small feet communicating with them (comm: all made of brass) and there is also the piston. The method of shooting is as described above. If the enemy comes to attack a city, these weapons are placed on the great [[defensive wall|rampart]]s, or else in outworks, so that large numbers of assailants cannot get through.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=83–84}}}}

The '''École française d'Extrême-Orient''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔl fʁɑ̃sɛːz dɛkstʁɛm ɔʁjɑ̃|lang}}, ''French School of the Far East''), abbreviated '''EFEO''', is an associated college of [[PSL University]] dedicated to the study of Asian societies.

== EFEO romanization system ==
{{main|EFEO Chinese transcription}}
A [[romanization]] system for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] was developed by the EFEO. It shares a few similarities with [[Wade-Giles]] and [[pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]. In modern times, it has been superseded by Hanyu Pinyin.

The differences between the three romanization systems are shown in the following table:
