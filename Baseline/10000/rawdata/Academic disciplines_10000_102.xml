'''Advertising in biology''' means the use of [[display (zoology)|displays]] by [[organism]]s such as [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[signalling theory|signal]] their presence for some [[evolution]]ary reason.

Such signalling may be honest, used to attract other organisms, as when [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s; or, again honestly, to warn off other organisms, as when distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] to prevent attacks from potential predators. Such honest advertising benefits both the sender and the receiver.

Other animals may advertise dishonestly; in [[Batesian mimicry]], edible animals more or less accurately mimic distasteful animals to reduce their own risk of being attacked by predators.

==In plants==
[[File:Flowers-of-Israel-ver006.jpg|thumb|[[Insect-pollinated]] [[flower]]s use a combination of cues to advertise themselves to insects.]]
{{further information|flower|entomophily}}

[[Insect-pollinated]] [[flower]]s use bright colours, patterns, rewards of [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], and scent to attract [[pollinator]]s such as [[bee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iolanda, Filella |author2=Primante, Clara |author3=Llusià, Joan |author4=Martín González, Ana M. |author5=Seco, Roger |author6=Farré-Armengol,Gerard |author7=Rodrigo, Anselm |author8=Bosch, Jordi |author9=Peñuelas, Josep |title=Floral advertisement scent in a changing plant-pollinators market |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2013 |volume=3 |page=3434 |doi=10.1038/srep03434|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep03434 |pmid=24305624 |pmc=3852139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also use drugs such as [[caffeine]] to encourage bees to return more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plants spike nectar with caffeine and give bees a buzz|journal=New Scientist|date=15 October 2015|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28349-plants-spike-nectar-with-caffeine-and-give-bees-a-buzz/|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is influenced by [[sexual selection]]: in [[dioecious]] plants like [[Salix caprea|sallow]], the male flowers are brighter yellow (the colour of their pollen) and have more scent than female flowers. Honey bees are more attracted by the brighter male flowers, but not by their scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dötterl, Stefan |author2=Glück, Ulrike |author3=Jürgens, Andreas |author4=Woodring, Joseph |author5=Aas, Gregor |title=Floral Reward, Advertisement and Attractiveness to Honey Bees in Dioecious ''Salix caprea''|journal=PLOS ONE| year=2014 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=e93421 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093421 |pmid=24676333 |pmc=3968154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds produce copious quantities of nectar and advertise this with their red coloration. Insects see red less well than other colours, and the plant needs to devote its energy to attracting birds that can act as pollinators rather than insects that cannot. In fact, the Canary Island [[Endemism|endemic]] ''[[Echium wildpretii]]'' has two subspecies, a red-flowering one on Teneriffe which is mainly pollinated by birds, and a pink-flowered one on Las Palmas which is pollinated by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rodríguez-Gironés, Miguel A. |author2=Santamaría, Luis |year=2004 |title=Why are so many bird flowers red? |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e306 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020350 |pmid=15486585 |pmc=521733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising takes a variety of forms in animals.&lt;ref name=Cott&gt;[[Cott, H. B.|Cott, Hugh B]] (1940). ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''. Methuen. page 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slater1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Peter J. B. |title=Essentials of Animal Behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEOePcIFW0IC&amp;pg=PA178 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62996-6 |pages=178–181 |chapter=8.5 Advertising displays}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding adults often [[display (zoology)|display]] to attract a mate. Breeding males of [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] birds, such as [[peacock]]s, [[Bird-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] and [[bower bird]]s, have elaborate [[plumage]], [[birdsong|song]], and [[ethology|behaviour]]. These evolved through [[sexual selection]] by females.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt; The males use these features alone or in combination to advertise their presence, and, especially but not only in species with [[lek mating]], to [[sexual competition|compete]] with rival males. In a lek, the presence of multiple males advertises and potentially benefits all the males present, so they are both collaborating and competing.&lt;ref name="Brudzynski2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brudzynski, Stefan M. |title=Handbook of Mammalian Vocalization: An Integrative Neuroscience Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TU9wYetjgsC&amp;pg=PA446 |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092337-6 |page=446 |quote=An advantage of lek mating is that males pool their advertising and courtship signals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeding males may also advertise [[honest signal|honestly]] to warn rival males of their strength, a classic example being the [[red deer]], where the roaring of a rutting stag reliably signals its size. The honest advertisement benefits both sender and receiver, as neither need become involved in a costly fight to assess their relative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clutton-Brock |first1=T. H. |last2=Albon |first2=S. D. |title=The Roaring of Red Deer and the Evolution of Honest Advertisement |journal=Behaviour |date=1979 |volume=69 |issue=3/4 |pages=145–170|jstor=4533969 |doi=10.1163/156853979x00449}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the breeding season, frogs congregate at suitable breeding sites and call to advertise their presence, particularly at night. Females can distinguish between the fitness of males based on the characteristics of their voices.&lt;ref name=Dorcas&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dorcas, Michael E.|author2=Gibbons, Whit|title=Frogs: The Animal Answer Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cST6P7aJToYC&amp;pg=PA35 |year=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-9935-5 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Animal behaviour: Truth in advertising|journal=[[The Economist]]|date=18 June 1998|url=http://www.economist.com/node/137078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desert toads emerge from their underground burrows in response to heavy rain. Males emerge first and when one finds a suitable ephemeral pool, its call attracts others and they all congregate there. Males may call in unison in noisy choruses, and breeding is explosive, a mass of males competing for the smaller number of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colour can be used in advertising. Some butterflies have [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on their wings. These make no effort at concealment, but may startle a potential predator into trying elsewhere. The [[western skink]] has a distinctive blue tail. If the skink cannot escape from a predator by concealment or flight, it can afford to lose its tail in order to escape with its life. Similarly, some species of [[grasshopper]] are well-camouflaged when at rest but flash vivid colouration when flying. The grasshopper thus avoids being eaten while the potential predator hunts in vain for the brightly coloured insect it saw.&lt;ref name=Ipsen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stebbins, Robert Cyril |author2=Ipsen, D.C.|author3=Gillfillan, Gretchen|title=Animal Coloration: Activities on the Evolution of Concealment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0JpRuexSY0C&amp;pg=PA2 |year=2008 |publisher=NSTA Press |isbn=978-1-933531-29-8 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acrocephalus schoenobaenus 1 (Marek Szczepanek)-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sedge warbler]] males advertise their fitness by the variety of their [[birdsong|song]] repertoire.]]

Male crickets chirp to attract females, and in some species, their calls can be heard from great distances. However, a certain parasitic fly has taken advantage of this, the female is attracted to a calling male cricket on which it then deposits its developing larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cade, W.H. | year = 1975 | title = Acoustically orienting parasitoids: Fly phonotaxis to cricket song | journal = Science | volume = 190| pages = 1312–1313 | doi=10.1126/science.190.4221.1312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate [[birdsong|song]] is especially well-developed among [[bird]]s, and again sexual selection has driven its evolution. Songbirds such as warblers have an extensive repertoire of songs, sometimes with thousands of phrases. The [[sedge warbler]] assembles an effectively infinite number of songs by assembling phrases in combination. Laboratory experiments by Clive Catchpole demonstrate that female sedge warblers select males with more varied songs, while field observation indicates that such males attract mates before other males.&lt;ref name=Slater1999/&gt;

Breeding females may advertise [[oestrus]] (being "on heat" or "in season", i.e. that they are fertile, [[ovulation|ovulating]] and receptive to breeding) with [[pheromone]]s (scent), courtship behaviour, and visual signals.&lt;ref name="IrwinStoner2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=Mark D. |last2=Stoner |first2=John B. |last3=Cobaugh |first3=Aaron M. |title=Zookeeping: An Introduction to the Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7TbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-92532-5 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human females have long been thought to conceal their ovulation, but women's behaviour changes around the time of ovulation with increased sexual motivation, and they are more attracted to men at that time; conversely, men are more attracted to the scent of women around the time of ovulation than in the non-ovulating (luteal) phase of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarin|first1=Juan J.|last2=Gomez-Piquer|first2=Vanessa|title=Do women have a hidden heat period?|journal=Human Reproduction|date=2002|volume=17|issue=9|pages=2243–2248|doi=10.1093/humrep/17.9.2243|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/9/2243.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distasteful animals use [[aposematism|warning coloration]] (aposematism) to prevent attacks from potential predators.&lt;ref name=Cott/&gt;

Many animals wish to advertise to those of their own species while being camouflaged to avoid [[predation]]. Many deep sea fish do this by way of [[bioluminescence]]. Patterns of [[photophore]]s on their undersides emit light that from below hide their silhouettes and resemble the scintillating lights produced by the ever-moving surface layers of water. At the same time, each species has a distinctive pattern of photophores that enables another member of its species to identify it as a con-specific.&lt;ref name=Bone&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bone, Quentin |author2=Moore, Richard |title=Biology of Fishes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLoqT_xWaqoC&amp;pg=PA328 |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science|isbn=978-0-203-88522-2 |pages=328, 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American anthropology''' has [[culture]] as its central and unifying concept. This most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human [[experience]]s [[symbol]]ically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:

# [[biological anthropology]]
# [[linguistic anthropology]]
# [[cultural anthropology]]
# [[archaeology]]

Research in these fields has influenced anthropologists working in other countries to different degrees.

== Biological anthropology ==

{{synthesis|date=May 2013}}
Discussion concerning culture among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] centers around two debates. First, is culture uniquely human or shared by other species (most notably, other primates)? This is an important question, as the theory of [[evolution]] holds that humans are descended from (now extinct) non-human primates. Second, how did culture evolve among human beings?

Gerald Weiss noted that although Tylor's classic definition of culture was restricted to humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like [[Robert Yerkes]] and [[Jane Goodall]] thus argued that since [[chimpanzee]]s have learned behaviors, they have culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yerkes 1943 ''Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]].  51–52, 189, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall 1963 "My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees" ''National Geographic'' 124: 308&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Andrew 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bryan 1963 "The Essential Morphological basis for Human Culture" ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keleman 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303 p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in nonhuman primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 301–328&lt;/ref&gt;

This scientific debate is complicated by ethical concerns. The subjects of primatology are non-human primates, and whatever culture these primates have is threatened by human activity. After reviewing the research on primate culture, W. C. McGrew concluded, "[a] discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primates are endangered by their human cousins.  Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival [i.e. to the survival of primate cultures]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 323&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrew suggests a definition of culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists do not have access to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew suggests that we view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
# A new pattern of behavior is invented, or an existing one is modified.
# The innovator transmits this pattern to another.
# The form of the pattern is consistent within and across performers, perhaps even in terms of recognizable stylistic features.
# The one who acquires the pattern retains the ability to perform it long after having acquired it.
# The pattern spreads across social units in a population. These social units may be families, clans, troops, or bands.
# The pattern endures across generations.
McGrew admits that all six criteria may be strict, given the difficulties in observing primate behavior in the wild. But he also insists on the need to be as inclusive as possible, on the need for a definition of culture that "casts the net widely":

{{quote|Culture is considered to be group-specific behavior that is acquired, at least in part, from social influences.  Here, group is considered to be the species-typical unit, whether it be a troop, lineage, subgroup, or so on.  ''Prima facie'' evidence of culture comes from within-species but across-group variation in behavior, as when a pattern is persistent in one community of chimpanzees but is absent from another, or when different communities perform different versions of the same pattern.  The suggestion of culture in action is stronger when the difference across the groups cannot be explained solely by ecological factors ....|&lt;ref&gt;W.C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 305&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Charles Frederick Voegelin pointed out, if "culture" is reduced to "learned behavior," then all animals have culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Voegelin 1951 "Culture, Language and the Human Organism" ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'' 7: 370&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly all specialists agree that all [[Primate cognition|primate species evidence common cognitive skills]]: knowledge of object-permanence, cognitive mapping, the ability to categorize objects, and creative problem solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}} Moreover, all primate species show evidence of shared social skills: they recognize members of their social group; they form direct relationships based on degrees of kinship and rank; they recognize third-party social relationships; they predict future behavior; and they cooperate in problem-solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}}

[[File:Lucy blackbg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cast of the skeleton of Lucy, an ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'']]
[[File:Human evolution chart-en.svg|thumb|left|One current view of the temporal and geographical distribution of [[human|hominid]] populations]]
Nevertheless, the term "culture" applies to non-human animals only if we define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars tend to think that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved to be different from other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for "culture".

Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'' and ''Pan paniscus'') are humans' (''Homo sapiens'') closest living relatives; both are descended from a common ancestor which lived around seven million years ago. [[Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae|Human evolution]] has been rapid with modern humans appearing about 340,000 years ago. During this time humanity evolved three distinctive features:
:(a) the creation and use of conventional symbols, including linguistic symbols and their derivatives, such as written language and mathematical symbols and notations; (b) the creation and use of complex tools and other instrumental technologies; and (c) the creation and participation in complex social organization and institutions.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}} According to [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Michael Tomasello]], "where these complex and species-unique behavioral practices, and the cognitive skills that underlie them, came from" is a fundamental anthropological question. Given that contemporary humans and chimpanzees are far more different from horses and zebras, or rats and mice, and that the evolution of this great difference occurred in such a short period of time, "our search must be for some small difference that made a big difference&amp;nbsp;– some adaptation, or small set of adaptations, that changed the process of primate cognitive evolution in fundamental ways."  According to Tomasello, the answer to this question must form the basis of a scientific definition of "human culture."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}}

In a recent review of the major research on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called "the [[ratchet effect]]:" innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." The key point is that children are born good at a particular kind of social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls "imitative learning," (as opposed to "[[Emulation (observational learning)|emulative learning]]" characteristic of other primates) and second,  the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates).  Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect.

The kind of learning found among other primates is "emulation learning," which "focuses on the environmental events involved&amp;nbsp;– results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced&amp;nbsp;– rather than on the actions that produced those results."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=520}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Tomasello 1990 "Cultural Transmission in the Tool Use and Communicatory Signaling of Chimpanzees?" in ''"Language" and Intelligence in Monkeys and Apes: Comparative Developmental Perspectives'' ed. S. Parker, K. Bibson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 274–311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press, pp. 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;  Tomasello emphasizes that emulation learning is a highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach-object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nagell, K., Olguin, K. and Tomasello, M. 1993 "Processes of social learning in the tool use of chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and human children (''Homo sapiens'')" in ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'' 107: 174–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of emulation learning are well documented among primates.  Notable examples include Japanese [[macaque]] potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed in her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over the next two years seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, and by the end of the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kawamura 1959 "The process of subcultural propagation among Japanese macaques" ''Primates'' 2: 43–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;M. Kawai 1965 "Newly acquired pre-cultural behavior of the natural troop of Japanese monkeys on Koshima Islet" ''Primates'' 6: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt; Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food.&lt;ref&gt;E. Visalberghi and D. M. Fragaszy 1990 "Food washing behavior in tufted Capuchin monkeys, ''Cebusapella'', and crabeating macaques, ''Macaca fasciculais''" ''Animal Behavior'' 40: 829–836&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=519}}

Chimpanzees exhibit a variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for termites using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites.  Some of this variation may be the result of "environmental shaping" (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects.  When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press. pp: 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of learning characteristic of human children is [[imitative learning]], which "means reproducing an instrumental act understood intentionally."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} Human infants begin to display some evidence of this form of learning between the ages of nine and 12 months, when infants fix their attention not only on an object, but on the gaze of an adult which enables them to use adults as points of reference and thus "act on objects in the way adults are acting on them."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=513}} This dynamic is well documented and has also been termed "joint engagement" or "joint attention."&lt;ref&gt;R. Bakerman and L. Adamson 1984 "Coordinating attention to people and objects in mother-infant and peer-infant interaction" in ''Child Development'' 55: 1278–1289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Moore and P. Dunham 1995 ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to this dynamic is the infant's growing capacity to recognize others as "intentional agents:" people "with the power to control their spontaneous behavior" and who "have goals and make active choices among behavioral means for attaining those goals."&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello 1995 "Joint attention as social cognition" in ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development,'' ed. C. Moore and P. Dunham.  Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press, pp. 103–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of skills in joint attention by the end of a human child's first year of life provides the basis for the development of imitative learning in the second year. In one study 14-month-old children imitated an adult's over-complex method of turning on a light, even when they could have used an easier and more natural motion to the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Meltzoff 1988 "Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 24: 470–476&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, 16-month-old children interacted with adults who alternated between a complex series of motions that appeared intentional and a comparable set of motions that appeared accidental; they imitated only those motions that appeared intentional.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, N. Akhtar, M. Tomasello 1998 "Sixteen-month old infants differentially imitate intentional and accidental actions" in ''Infant Behavior &amp; Development'' 21: 315–330&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of 18-month old children revealed that children imitate actions that adults intend, yet in some way fail, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;A. Meltzoff 1995 "Understanding the intentions of others: re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 31: 838–850&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomasello emphasizes that this kind of imitative learning "relies fundamentally on infants' tendency to identify with adults, and on their ability to distinguish in the actions of others the underlying goal and the different means that might be used to achieve it."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=514}} He calls this kind of imitative learning "cultural learning because the child is not just learning about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them&amp;nbsp;— in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=515}}&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M., Kruger, A. &amp; Ratner, H. 1993 "Cultural learning" ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' 16, 495–552&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual "understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Emulation learning and imitative learning are two different adaptations that can only be assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object.  Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared on the basis of these results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an [[evolution]]ary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task.  Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the "ratchet effect" that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|pp=520–521}}

Tomasello further argues that cultural learning is essential for language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. "In general, for the vast majority of words in their language, children must find a way to learn in the ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello and M. Barton 1994 "Learning Words in non-Ostensive Contexts" ''Developmental Psychology'' 30: 639–650&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Akhtar and M. Tomasello 1996 "Twenty-four month old children learn words for absent objects and actions" in ''British Journal of Developmental Psychology'' 14: 79–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello, R. Strosberg, N. Akhtar 1996 "Eighteen-month old children learn words in non-ostensive contexts" in ''Journal of Child Language''; 23: 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello concludes that "a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Tomasello's 1999 review of the research contrasting human and non-human primate learning strategies confirms [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Ralph Holloway]]'s 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue in the evolution of ''H. sapiens'', and the key to understanding "culture," "is how man organizes his experience." Culture is "the ''imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment.''"{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}} This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=396}}

In other words, whereas McGrew argues that anthropologists must focus on behaviors like communication and tool-use because they have no access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest [[stone tool]]s in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the question is not ''whether'' other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the ''way'' they do these things. "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," and other examples of primate tool-use and learning "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=400}} Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic.  In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}

In Holloway's view, our non-human ancestors, like those of modern chimpanzees and other primates, shared motor and sensory skills, curiosity, memory, and intelligence, with perhaps differences in degree. He adds: "It is when these are integrated with the unique attributes of arbitrary production (symbolization) and imposition that man qua cultural man appears."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

He also adds:

{{quote|I have suggested above that whatever culture may be, it includes "the imposition of arbitrary forms upon the environment."  This phrase has two components. One is a recognition that the relationship between the coding process and the phenomenon (be it a tool, social network, or abstract principle) is non-iconic. The other is an idea of man as a creature who can make delusional systems work—who imposes his fantasies, his non-iconic constructs (and constructions), upon the environment.  The altered environment shapes his perceptions, and these are again forced back on the environment, are incorporated into the environment, and press for further adaptation.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}}}}

This is comparable to the "ratcheting" aspect suggested by Tomasello and others that enabled human evolution to accelerate. Holloway concludes that the first instance of symbolic thought among humans provided a "kick-start" for brain development, tool complexity, social structure, and language to evolve through a constant dynamic of positive feedback. "This interaction between the propensity to structure the environment arbitrarily and the feedback from the environment to the organism is an emergent process, a process different in kind from anything that preceded it."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

Linguists [[Charles Hockett]] and R. Ascher have identified thirteen design-features of language, some shared by other forms of animal communication. One feature that distinguishes human language is its tremendous productivity; in other words, competent speakers of a language are capable of producing an exponential number of original utterances. This productivity seems to be made possible by a few critical features unique to human language. One is "duality of patterning," meaning that human language consists of the articulation of several distinct processes, each with its own set of rules: combining [[phonemes]] to produce [[morphemes]], combining [[morphemes]] to produce words, and combining words to produce sentences. This means that a person can master a relatively limited number of signals and sets of rules, to create infinite combinations.  Another crucial element is that human language is [[symbol]]ic: the sound of words (or their shape, when written) typically bear no relation to what they represent.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher 1964 "The Human Revolution" in ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 135–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, their meaning is arbitrary. That words have meaning is a matter of convention. Since the meaning of words are arbitrary, any word may have several meanings, and any object may be referred to using a variety of words; the actual word used to describe a particular object depends on the context, the intention of the speaker, and the ability of the listener to judge these appropriately.  As Tomasello notes,

{{quote|An individual language user looks at a tree and, before drawing the attention of her interlocutor to that tree, must decide, based on her assessment of the listener's current knowledge and expectations, whether to say "that tree over there," "it," "the oak," "that hundred-year-oak," "the tree," "the bagswing tree," "that thing in the front yard," "the ornament," "the embarrassment," or any of a number of other expressions.  ... And these decisions are not made on the basis of the speaker's direct goal with respect to the object or activity involved, but rather that they are made on the basis of her goal with respect to the listener's interest and attention to that object or activity. This is why symbolic cognition and communication and imitative learning go hand-in-hand.|{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=517}}}}

Holloway argues that the stone tools associated with genus ''Homo'' have the same features of human language:
{{quote|Returning to matter of syntax, rules, and concatenated activity mentioned above, almost any model which describes a language process can also be used to describe tool-making.  This is hardly surprising.  Both activities are concatenated, both have rigid rules about the serialization of unit activities (the grammar, syntax), both are hierarchical systems of activity (as is any motor activity), and both produce arbitrary configurations which thence become part of the environment, either temporarily or permanently.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}}}

He also adds:

{{quote|Productivity can be seen in the facts that basic types were probably used for multiple purposes, that tool industries tend to expand with time, and that a slight variation on a basic pattern may be made to meet some new functional requisite. ''Elements of a basic "vocabulary" of motor operations—flakes, detachment, rotation, preparation of striking platform, etc.—are used in different combinations to produce dissimilar tools, with different forms, and supposedly, different uses''. . . . Taking each motor event alone, no one action is complete; each action depends on the prior one and requires a further one, and each is dependent on another ax on the original plan. In other words, at each point of the action except the last, the piece is not "satisfactory" in structure. Each unit action is meaningless by itself in the sense of the use of the tool; it is meaningful only in the context of the whole completed set of actions culminating in the final product. This exactly parallels language.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=402}}}}

As Tomasello demonstrates, symbolic thought can operate only in a particular social environment:

{{quote|Arbitrary symbols enforce consensus of perceptions, which not only allows members to communicate about the same objects in terms of space and time (as in hunting) but it also makes it possible for social relationships to be standardized and manipulated through symbols. It means that idiosyncrasies are smoothed out and perceived within classes of behavior. By enforcing perceptual invariance, symbols also enforce social behavioral constancy, and enforcing social behavioral constancy is a prerequisite to differential task-role sectors in a differentiated social group adapting not only to the outside environment but to its own membership.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=406}}}}

[[Biological anthropology|Biological anthropologist]] Terrence Deacon, in a synthesis of over twenty years of research on human evolution, human neurology, and primatology, describes this "ratcheting effect" as a form of "Baldwinian Evolution." Named after [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin|James Baldwin]], this describes a situation in which an animal's behavior has evolutionary consequences when it changes the natural environment and thus the selective forces acting on the animal.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=322}}

{{quote|Once some useful behavior spreads within a population and becomes more important for subsistence, it will generate selection pressures on genetic traits that support its propagation ... Stone and symbolic tools, which were initially acquired with the aid of flexible ape-learning abilities, ultimately turned the tables on their users and forced them to adapt to a new niche opened by these technologies.  Rather than being just useful tricks, these behavioral prostheses for obtaining food and organizing social behaviors became indispensable elements in a new adaptive complex.  The origin of "humanness" can be defined as that point in our evolution where these tools became the {{sic|?|principle}} source of selection on our bodies and brains.  It is the diagnostic of ''Homo symbolicus''.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=344}}}}

According to Deacon, this occurred between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, when we have the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=340}} More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that ''Australopithecines'', like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of ''Australopithecine'' history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=347}} This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus ''Homo''.

The question for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes could have made the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of ''H. sapiens'' began with ancestors who did not yet have "culture," what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)?  Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to ''H. sapiens'' to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species:
# Both males and females usually contribute effort towards the rearing of their offspring, though often to differing extents and in very different ways.
# In all societies, the great majority of adult males and females are bound by long-term, exclusive sexual access rights and prohibitions to particular individuals of the opposite sex.
# They maintain these exclusive sexual relations while living in modest to large-sized, multi-male, multi-female, cooperative social groups.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=384–385}} 
Moreover, there is one feature common to all known human foraging societies (all humans prior to ten or fifteen thousand years ago), and markedly different from other primates: "the use of meat. . . . The appearance of the first stone tools nearly 2.5 million years ago almost certainly correlates with a radical shift in foraging behavior to gain access to meat."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=386}} Deacon does not believe that symbolic thought was necessary for hunting or tool-making (although tool-making may be a reliable index of symbolic thought); rather, it was necessary for the success of distinctive social relations.

The key is that while men and women are equally effective foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression plays an important role in maintaining sexual access to mate(s).

{{quote|Human reliance on resources that are relatively unavailable to females with infants selects not only for cooperation between a child's father and mother but also for the cooperation of other relatives and friends, including elderly individuals and juveniles, who can be relied upon for assistance. The special demands of acquiring meat and caring for infants in our own evolution together contribute to the underlying impetus for the third characteristic feature of human reproductive patterns: cooperative group living.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=386–387}}}}

What is uniquely characteristic about human societies is what required symbolic cognition, which consequently leads to the evolution of culture: "cooperative, mixed-sex social groups, with significant male care and provisioning of offspring, and relatively stable patterns of reproductive exclusion." This combination is relatively rare in other species because it is "highly susceptible to disintegration."  Language and culture provide the glue that holds it together.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=388}}

Chimpanzees also, on occasion, hunt meat; in most cases, however, males consume the meat immediately, and only on occasion share with females who happen to be nearby. Among chimpanzees, hunting for meat increases when other sources of food become scarce, but under these conditions sharing decreases. The first forms of symbolic thinking made stone tools possible, which in turn made hunting for meat a more dependable source of food for our nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms of social communication that make sharing between males and females, but also among males, decreasing sexual competition:

{{quote|So the socio-ecological problem posed by the transition to a meat-supplemented subsistence strategy is that it cannot be utilized without a social structure which guarantees unambiguous and exclusive mating and is sufficiently egalitarian to sustain cooperation via shared or parallel reproductive interests. This problem can be solved symbolically.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=396–397}}}}

Symbols and symbolic thinking thus make possible a central feature of social relations in every human population: reciprocity. Evolutionary scientists have developed [[Inclusive fitness|a model]] to explain [[reciprocal altruism]] among closely related individuals. Symbolic thought makes possible reciprocity between distantly related individuals.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=397–401}}

== Archaeology ==

In the 19th century [[archaeology]] was often a supplement to [[history]], and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] and [[stratigraphy]], thus marking their location in time and space. [[Franz Boas]] established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]] and American archaeologist [[W. C. McKern]] independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking about the people who produced it&amp;nbsp;— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods.  Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model:
# An individual artifact, which has surface, shape, and technological attributes (e.g. an arrowhead)
# A sub-assemblage, consisting of artifacts that are found, and were likely used, together (e.g. an arrowhead, bow and knife)
# An assemblage of sub-assemblages that together constitute the archaeological site (e.g. the arrowhead, bow and knife; a pot and the remains of a hearth; a shelter)
Childe argued that a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts" is an "[[archaeological culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;V. Gordon Childe 1929 ''The Danube in Prehistory'' Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By R. Lee Lyman and Michael J. O'Brien, 2003 ''W.C. McKern and the Midwestern Taxonomic Method.''  University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt;  Childe and others viewed "each archaeological culture ... the manifestation in material terms of a specific ''people''."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, 2008 ''Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice'' Fifth edition.

In 1948, [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] systematized the methods and concepts that archaeologists had developed and proposed a general model for the archaeological contribution to knowledge of cultures.  He began with the mainstream understanding of culture as the product of human cognitive activity, and the Boasian emphasis on the subjective meanings of objects as dependent on their cultural context.  He defined culture as "a mental phenomenon, consisting of the contents of minds, not of material objects or observable behavior."{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p= 96}}  He then devised a three-tiered model linking cultural anthropology to archeology, which he called [[conjunctive archaeology]]:
# Culture, which is unobservable (behavior) and nonmaterial
# Behaviors resulting from culture, which are observable and nonmaterial
# Objectifications, such as artifacts and architecture, which are the result of behavior and material
That is, material artifacts were the material residue of culture, but not culture itself.{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p=100}}  Taylor's point was that the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people.  Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented.  One reason was that his three-tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.685&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunnel 1986 "Five Decades of American Archaeology" in ''American Archaeology Past and Future: A Celebration of the Society for American Archaeology, 1935–1985''.  D. Meltzer and J. Sabloff, eds.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Leslie White's former student [[Lewis Binford]] proposed a new model for anthropological archaeology, called "the New Archaeology" or "[[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]]," based on White's definition of culture as "the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see White 1959 ''The Evolution of Culture'' New York: McGraw Hill p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition allowed Binford to establish archaeology as a crucial field for the pursuit of the methodology of Julian Steward's cultural ecology:

{{quote|The comparative study of cultural systems with variable technologies in a similar environmental range or similar technologies in differing environments is a major methodology of what Steward (1955: 36–42) has called "cultural ecology," and certainly is a valuable means of increasing our understanding of cultural processes. Such a methodology is also useful in elucidating the structural relationships between major cultural sub-systems such as the social and ideological sub-systems.|&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change''. University of Illinois Press, Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Binford proposed an archaeology that would be central to the dominant project of cultural anthropologists at the time (culture as non-genetic adaptations to the environment); the "new archaeology" was the cultural anthropology (in the form of cultural ecology or ecological anthropology) of the past.

In the 1980s, there was a movement in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.684&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same period, then-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]] developed "[[post-processual archaeology]]" as an alternative.  Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but ''as'' culture itself.  Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation.  Instead, he "is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which material items, artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes."&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) pp. 687–6874&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1982 book, ''Symbols in Action'', evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, as an alternative to White and Steward's materialist view of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1982 ''Symbols in action: ethnoarchaeological studies of material culture''  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1991 textbook, ''Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology'' Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1986 ''Reading the past: current approaches to interpretation in archaeology'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic anthropology ==

The connection between culture and language has been noted as far back as the classical period and probably long before. The ancient Greeks, for example, distinguished between civilized peoples and [[Barbarian|bárbaroi]] "those who babble", i.e. those who speak unintelligible languages.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, Paul. 2003. "White slaves, African masters." The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 588(1): 90–111. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that different groups speak different, unintelligible languages is often considered more tangible evidence for cultural differences than other less obvious cultural traits.

The German romanticists of the 19th century such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], often saw language not just as one cultural trait among many but rather as the direct expression of a people's national character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such as culture in a kind of condensed form. Herder for example suggests, "''Denn jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache''" (Since every people is a People, it has its own national culture expressed through its own language).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anderson, Benedict R.O'G. 1983. ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.'' London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas, founder of American anthropology, like his German forerunners, maintained that the shared language of a community is the most essential carrier of their common culture. Boas was the first anthropologist who considered it unimaginable to study the culture of a foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. For Boas, the fact that the intellectual culture of a people was largely constructed, shared and maintained through the use of language, meant that understanding the language of a cultural group was the key to understanding its culture. At the same time, though, Boas and his students were aware that culture and language are not directly dependent on one another. That is, groups with widely different cultures may share a common language, and speakers of completely unrelated languages may share the same fundamental cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1921:228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1995: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other scholars have suggested that the form of language determines specific cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Von Humboldt, Wilhelm. 1820. ''Über das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwicklung''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the notion of [[linguistic determinism]], which states that the form of language determines individual thought. While Boas himself rejected a causal link between language and culture, some of his intellectual heirs entertained the idea that habitual patterns of speaking and thinking in a particular language may influence the culture of the linguistic group.{{sfn|Whorf|1941}} Such belief is related to the theory of [[linguistic relativity]]. Boas, like most modern anthropologists, however, was more inclined to relate the interconnectedness between language and culture to the fact that, as [[B.L. Whorf]] put it, "they have grown up together".{{sfn|Whorf|1941|p=293}}&lt;ref&gt;See also e.g. Boas, Franz. 1911. "Introduction." ''Handbook of American Indian Languages''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[origin of language]], understood as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and the origin of complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin I. Dunbar]] has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged as a means of using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example [[Social grooming|grooming]]. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the [[Structuralism|structural]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of [[semiotics]]. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound &lt;nowiki&gt;[kau]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the meaning "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of "wearing a crown" and the cultural meaning of "being king". In this way it can be argued that culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;(Duranti 1997: 49)(Mannheim &amp; Tedlock 1995: 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in&amp;nbsp;– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.

However, languages, now understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. In linguistics such different ways of using the same language are called "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]". For example, the English language is spoken differently in the US, the UK and Australia, and even within English-speaking countries there are hundreds of [[dialect]]s of English that each signals a belonging to a particular region and/or subculture. For example, in the UK the [[cockney]] dialect signals its speakers' belonging to the group of lower class workers of east London. Differences between varieties of the same language often consist in different pronunciations and vocabulary, but also sometimes of different grammatical systems and very often in using different [[Style (sociolinguistics)|styles]] (e.g. cockney [[rhyming slang]] or [[Legalese#Legalese|lawyers' jargon]]). Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]] and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.

A community's ways of speaking or signing are a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are. Language use is a way of establishing and displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. Linguists call different ways of speaking language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[Style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Patricia. (1986) "The acquisition of communicative style in Japanese." In B. Schieffelin and E. Ochs (eds) ''Language Socialization across Cultures''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also in different "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of "social deixis", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;Foley 1997 p??&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor" or "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt; Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special [[Baby talk|ways of speaking to infants and children]]. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail ''not speaking'' to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a [[taboo]] against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|Japanese]] and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;Men's and Women's Speech in Koasati, Mary R. Haas, ''Language'', Vol. 20, No. 3 (Jul.&amp;nbsp;– Sep., 1944), pp. 142–149 (also summarized in Foley 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural anthropology ==

=== Universal versus particular ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Boas]] established modern American anthropology as the study of the sum total of human phenomena. c. 1915]]

The modern anthropological concept of culture has its origins in the 19th century with German anthropologist [[Adolf Bastian]]'s theory of the "psychic unity of mankind," which, influenced by Herder and von Humboldt, challenged the identification of "culture" with the way of life of European elites, and British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s attempt to define culture as inclusively as possible.  Tylor in 1874 described culture in the following way: "Culture or [[civilization]], taken in its wide [[ethnographic]] sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. 1874. ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tylor was not aiming to propose a general theory of culture (he explained his understanding of culture in the course of a larger argument about the nature of religion), American anthropologists have generally presented their various definitions of culture as refinements of Tylor's.  Franz Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] (1876–1970) identified culture with the "superorganic," that is, a domain with ordering principles and laws that could not be explained by or reduced to biology.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Kroeber 1917 "The Superorganic" ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 19, No. 2 pp. 163–213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Gerald Weiss reviewed various definitions of culture and debates as to their parsimony and power, and proposed as the most scientifically useful definition that "culture" be defined "''as our generic term for all human nongenetic, or metabiological, phenomena''" (italics in the original).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weiss 1973 "A Scientific Concept of Culture" in ''American Anthropologist'' 75(5): 1382&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruth Benedict]] was instrumental in establishing the modern conception of distinct cultures being patterned. 1937]]

[[Franz Boas]] founded modern American anthropology with the establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896.  At the time the dominant model of culture was that of [[cultural evolution]], which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and [[Iroquois kinship]] terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and [[Eskimo kinship]] terminology.  One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, that it was impossible to develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of [[cultural relativism]] and trained students to conduct rigorous [[participant observation]] field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]].  Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying "culture" as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural "types" or "forms" are always in a state of flux.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1920] "The Methods of Ethnology", in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  253&lt;/ref&gt; His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred L., 1948, ''Anthropology: Race, Language, Culture, Psychology, Prehistory'' revised edition.  New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, Inc. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Boas's students dominated [[cultural anthropology]] through World War II, and continued to have great influence through the 1960s.  They were especially interested in two phenomena: the great variety of forms culture took around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1907 "Anthropology" in ''A Franz Boas Reader: The Shaping of American Anthropology 1883–1911'' ed. George Stocking Jr. 267–382&lt;/ref&gt; and the many ways individuals were shaped by and acted creatively through their own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, Franz 1920 "The Methods of Ethnology" in ''Race, Language, and Culture''. ed.

New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth. ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword:  Patterns of Japanese Culture.''  Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan:  Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead 1928 ''Coming of Age in Samoa''&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to their research was the concept of "context": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures.  Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing [[cultural universal]]s or universal theories of culture.

There is a tension in cultural anthropology between the claim that culture is a universal (the fact that all human societies have culture), and that it is also particular (culture takes a tremendous variety of forms around the world). Since Boas, two debates have dominated cultural anthropology. The first has to do with ways of modeling particular cultures. Specifically, anthropologists have argued as to whether "culture" can be thought of as a bounded and integrated thing, or as a quality of a diverse collection of things, the numbers and meanings of which are in constant flux. Boas's student Ruth Benedict suggested that in any given society cultural traits may be more or less "integrated," that is, constituting a pattern of action and thought that gives purpose to people's lives, and provides them with a basis from which to evaluate new actions and thoughts, although she implies that there are various degrees of integration; indeed, she observes that some cultures fail to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boas, however, argued that complete integration is rare and that a given culture only appears to be integrated because of observer bias.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1932]  "The Aims of Anthropological Research," in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Boas, the appearance of such patterns—a national culture, for example—was the effect of a particular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Bashkow, Ira 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries" ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3): 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debate was effectively suspended in 1934 when Ruth Benedict published ''[[Patterns of Culture]]'', which has continuously been in print.  Although this book is well known for popularizing the Boasian principle of [[cultural relativism]], among anthropologists it constituted both an important summary of the discoveries of Boasians, and a decisive break from Boas's emphasis on the mobility of diverse cultural traits.  "Anthropological work has been overwhelmingly devoted to the analysis of cultural traits," she wrote "rather than to the study of cultures as articulated wholes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Polish-British social anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]], however, she argued that "The first essential, so it seems today, is to study the living culture, to know its habits of thought and the functions of its institutions" and that "the only way in which we can know the significance of the selected detail of behavior is against the background of the motives and emotions and values that are institutionalized in that culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by German historians [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Oswald Spengler]], as well as by [[gestalt psychology]], she argued that "the whole determines its parts, not only their relation but their very nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1934 ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and that "cultures, likewise, are more than the sum of their traits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She observed that "Just as each spoken language draws very selectively from an extensive, but finite, set of sounds any human mouth (free from defect) can make, she concluded that in each society people, over time and through both conscious and unconscious processes, selected from an extensive but finite set of cultural traits which then combine to form a unique and distinctive pattern."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Benedict argues

{{quote|The significance of cultural behavior is not exhausted when we have clearly understood that it is local and man-made and hugely variable.  It tends to be integrated.  A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.  Within each culture there come into being characteristic purposes not necessarily shared by other types of society.  In obedience to their purposes, each people further and further consolidates its experience, and in proportion to the urgency of these drives the heterogeneous items of behavior take more and more congruous shape.  Taken up by a well-integrated culture, the most ill-assorted acts become characteristic of its particular goals, often by the most unlikely metamorphoses.|&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Benedict felt that virtually all cultures are patterned, she argued that these patterns change over time as a consequence of human creativity, and therefore different societies around the world had distinct characters. ''Patterns of Culture'' contrasts [[Zuni people|Zuňi]], [[Dobu]] and [[Kwakiutl]] cultures as a way of highlighting different ways of being human.  Benedict observed that many Westerners felt that this view forced them to abandon their "dreams of permanence and ideality and with the individual's illusions of autonomy" and that for many, this made existence "empty."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.277&lt;/ref&gt;  She argued however that once people accepted the results of scientific research, people would "arrive then at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

This view of culture has had a tremendous impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until [[the Cold War]], when anthropologists like [[Sidney Mintz]] and [[Eric Wolf]] rejected the validity and value of approaching "each culture" as "a world in itself" and "relatively stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.271&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that, too often, this approach ignored the impact of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], and the world [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened the debate on the relationship between the universal and the particular, in the form of the relationship between the global and the local).  In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French [[structuralism]] and made American anthropologists receptive to British [[structural-functionalism]].

[[File:Cousin-Kinship-chart.png|thumb|left|300px|Iroqois Kinship Structure]]
The second debate has been over the ability to make universal claims about all cultures.  Although Boas argued that anthropologists had yet to collect enough solid evidence from a diverse sample of societies to make any valid general or universal claims about culture, by the 1940s some felt ready. Whereas Kroeber and Benedict had argued that "culture"—which could refer to local, regional, or trans-regional scales—was in some way "patterned" or "configured," some anthropologists now felt that enough data had been collected to demonstrate that it often took highly structured forms.  The question these anthropologists debated was, were these structures statistical artifacts, or where they expressions of mental models?  This debate emerged full-fledged in 1949, with the publication of [[George Murdock]]'s ''Social Structure'', and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Les Structures Élémentaires de la Parenté''.

Opposing Boas and his students was [[Yale University|Yale]] anthropologist [[George Murdock]], who compiled the [[Human Relations Area Files]].  These files code cultural variables found in different societies, so that anthropologists can use [[statistics|statistical methods]] to study correlations among different variables.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, George, 1949 ''Social Structure'' New York: The Macmillan Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1967. ''Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1981. ''Atlas of World Cultures''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate aim of this project is to develop generalizations that apply to increasingly larger numbers of individual cultures.  Later, Murdock and [[Douglas R. White]] developed the [[standard cross-cultural sample]] as a way to refine this method.

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structuralism|structuralist anthropology]] brought together ideas of Boas (especially Boas's belief in the mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's [[Émile Durkheim]]'s focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature.  His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing members of the same society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as [[myth]]s and [[ritual]]s) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only ''not'' consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people ''are'' aware).  He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures.  He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe.  The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural "table of elements," and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude 1955 ''Tristes Tropiques'' Atheneum Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude ''[[Mythologiques I-IV]]'' (trans. John Weightman and Doreen Weightman); ''Le Cru et le cuit'' (1964), ''The Raw and the Cooked'' (1969); ''Du miel aux cendres'' (1966), ''From Honey to Ashes'' (1973); ''L'Origine des manières de table'' (1968) ''The Origin of Table Manners'' (1978); ''L'Homme nu'' (1971), ''The Naked Man'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.

Murdock's HRAF and Lévi-Strauss's structuralism provide two ambitious ways to seek the universal in the particular, and both approaches continue to appeal to different anthropologists.  However, the differences between them reveal a tension implicit in the heritage of Tylor and Bastian.  Is culture to be found in [[empiricism|empirically]] observed behaviors that may form the basis of generalizations?  Or does it consist of universal mental processes, which must be inferred and abstracted from observed behavior?  This question has driven debates among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[archeology|archeologists]] as well.

=== Structural functionalism ===

In structural functionalism, as a [[social theory]], society is viewed as "a reality of structural and cultural components or "facts" that can be investigated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=24gOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Structural%20functionalism&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Structural-functionalism] in Michael Rosenberg, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Routledge, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the 1940s the Boasian understanding of culture was challenged by that new paradigm for anthropological and social science research.  This paradigm developed independently but in parallel in both the United Kingdom and in the United States (In both cases it is ''sui generis'': it has no direct relationship to "structuralism" except that both French structuralism and Anglo-American Structural-Functionalism were all influenced by Durkheim.  It is also analogous, but unrelated to, other forms of "functionalism").  Whereas the Boasians viewed anthropology as that natural science dedicated to the study of humankind, structural functionalists viewed anthropology as one social science among many, dedicated to the study of one specific facet of humanity.  This led structural-functionalists to redefine and minimize the scope of "culture."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the United Kingdom, the creation of structural functionalism was anticipated by [[Raymond Firth]]'s (1901–2002) ''We the Tikopia'', published in 1936, and marked by the publication of ''African Political Systems'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] (1906–1983) and [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Firth 1936 ''We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia'' London Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Fortes and E.E. Evans Pritchard 1940. ''African Political Systems''. London and New York: International African Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942), and his rival, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] (1881–1955).  Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology—what they call "[[social anthropology]]"—as that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies.  According to Malinowski's theory of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], all human beings have certain biological needs, such as the need for food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce.  Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs.  In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact.  Although members of any given society may not understand the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life.&lt;ref&gt;Bronisław Malinowski 1944 ''The Scientific Theory of Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;  Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies.  Influenced by the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1952 ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''&lt;/ref&gt;  Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures.  They distinguished between "social organization" (observable social interactions) and "social structure" (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability.  In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra-somatic phenomena) they made "sociality" (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study.  (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote "I should like to invoke a taboo on the word ''culture''.")&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1957 ''A Natural Science of Society'' Glencoe: The Free Press p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, in 1946 [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) founded the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]] at [[Harvard University]].  Influenced by such European sociologists as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]], Parsons developed a theory of social action that was closer to British [[social anthropology]] than to Boas's American anthropology, and which he also called "structural functionalism."  Parson's intention was to develop a total theory of social action (why people act as they do), and to develop at Harvard an inter-disciplinary program that would direct research according to this theory.  His model explained human action as the result of four systems:
# the "behavioral system" of biological needs
# the "personality system" of an individual's characteristics affecting their functioning in the social world
# the "social system" of patterns of units of social interaction, especially social status and role
# the "cultural system" of norms and values that regulate social action symbolically

According to this theory, the second system was the proper object of study for psychologists; the third system for sociologists, and the fourth system for cultural anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons 1937, ''The Structure of Social Action''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons
1951, ''The Social System''&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Boasians considered all of these systems to be objects of study by anthropologists, and "personality" and "status and role" to be as much a part of "culture" as "norms and values," Parsons envisioned a much narrower role for anthropology and a much narrower definition of culture.

Although Boasian cultural anthropologists were interested in norms and values, among many other things, it was only with the rise of structural functionalism that people came to identify "culture" with "norms and values." Many American anthropologists rejected this view of culture (and by implication, anthropology). In 1980, anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] wrote,

{{quote|As the social sciences transformed themselves into "behavioral" science, explanations for behavior were no longer traced to culture: behavior was to be understood in terms of psychological encounters, strategies of economic choice, strivings for payoffs in games of power.  Culture, once extended to all acts and ideas employed in social life, was now relegated to the margins as "world view" or "values".|&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1980 "They Divide and Subdivide and Call it Anthropology."  ''The New York Times'' November 30:E9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, several of Talcott Parsons' students emerged as leading American anthropologists.  At the same time, many American anthropologists had a high regard for the research produced by social anthropologists in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research.

The combination of American cultural anthropology theory with British social anthropology methods has led to some confusion between the concepts of "society" and "culture." For most anthropologists, these are distinct concepts. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to a pan-human capacity and the totality of non-genetic human phenomena.  Societies are often clearly bounded; cultural traits are often mobile, and cultural boundaries, such as they are, can be typically porous, permeable, and plural.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Bashkow, 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries," ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3):445–446&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1950s, and 1960s anthropologists often worked in places where social and cultural boundaries coincided, thus obscuring the distinction.  When disjunctures between these boundaries become highly salient, for example during the period of European de-colonization of Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, or during the [[Bretton Woods system|post-Bretton Woods]] realignment of [[globalization]], however, the difference often becomes central to anthropological debates.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun 1986 ''The Social Life of Things''.

Parsons' students [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[David M. Schneider]], and Schneider's student [[Roy Wagner]], went on to important careers as cultural anthropologists and developed a school within American cultural anthropology called "symbolic anthropology," the study of the social construction and social effects of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz 1973 ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Schneider 1968 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Wagner 1980 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Dolgin, David Kemnitzer, and David Schneider, eds. ''Symbolic Anthropology: a Reader in the Study of Symbols and Meanings''&lt;/ref&gt;  Since symbolic anthropology easily complemented social anthropologists' studies of social life and social structure, many British structural-functionalists (who rejected or were uninterested in Boasian cultural anthropology) accepted the Parsonian definition of "culture" and "cultural anthropology."  British anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] (who eventually left the United Kingdom to teach in the United States) was an important bridge between American and British symbolic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner 1967 ''The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to symbols, the meaning of which depended almost entirely on their historical and social context, appealed to many Boasians. [[Leslie White]] asked of cultural things, "What sort of objects are they? Are they physical objects? Mental objects? Both? Metaphors? Symbols? Reifications?" In ''Science of Culture'' (1949), he concluded that they are objects "''[[sui generis]]''"; that is, of their own kind. In trying to define that kind, he hit upon a previously unrealized aspect of symbolization, which he called "the symbolate"—an object created by the act of symbolization. He thus defined culture as "symbolates understood in an extra-somatic context."&lt;ref&gt;White, L. 1949. ''The Science of Culture: A study of man and civilization.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by the 1930s White began turning away from the Boasian approach.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Barrett 1989, "The Paradoxical Anthropology of Leslie White,"
''American Anthropologist'' Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 986–999&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,

{{quote|In order to live man, like all other species, must come to terms with the external world.... Man employs his sense organs, nerves, glands, and muscles in adjusting himself to the external world. But in addition to this he has another means of adjustment and control.... This mechanism is ''culture''.|&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1949 "Ethnological Theory." In ''Philosophy for the Future: The Quest of Modern Materialism''. R. W. Sellars, V.J. McGill, and M. Farber, eds. Pp. 357–384. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this view echoes that of Malinowski, the key concept for White was not "function" but "adaptation."  Whereas the Boasians were interested in the history of specific traits, White was interested in the cultural history of the human species, which he felt should be studied from an evolutionary perspective.  Thus, the task of anthropology is to study "not only how culture evolves, but why as well.... In the case of man ... the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something— these are the factors of cultural evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1943 "Energy and the Evolution of Culture." ''American Anthropologist'' 45: 339&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike 19th century evolutionists, who were concerned with how civilized societies rose above primitive societies, White was interested in documenting how, over time, humankind as a whole has through cultural means discovered more and more ways for capturing and harnessing energy from the environment, in the process transforming culture.

At the same time that White was developing his theory of [[cultural evolution]], Kroeber's student [[Julian Steward]] was developing his theory of [[cultural ecology]].  In 1938, he published ''Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Socio-Political Groups'' in which he argued that diverse societies—for example the indigenous [[Shoshone]] or White farmers on the Great Plains—were not less or more evolved; rather, they had adapted to different environments in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1938 ''Basin Plateau Aboriginal Socio-political Groups'' (Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, No 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Leslie White was interested in culture understood holistically as a property of the human species, Julian Steward was interested in culture as the property of distinct societies.  Like White he viewed culture as a means of adapting to the environment, but he criticized Whites "unilineal" (one direction) theory of cultural evolution and instead proposed a model of "multilineal" evolution in which (in the Boasian tradition) each society has its own cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

When Julian Steward left a teaching position at the University of Michigan to work in Utah in 1930, Leslie White took his place; in 1946 Julian Steward was made Chair of the Columbia University Anthropology Department.  In the 1940s and 1950s their students, most notably [[Marvin Harris]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Elman Service]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]] and [[Eric Wolf]] dominated American anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1979 ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1977 ''Cannibals and Kings: Origins of Cultures'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1974 ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy A. Rappaport 1967 ''Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward, ed. 1966 ''The people of Puerto Rico: a study in social anthropology''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press (includes doctoral dissertations of Mintz and Wolf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Murphy 1960 ''Headhunter's Heritage; Social and Economic Change Among the Mundurucu Indians''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service, ''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elman R. Service 1962 ''Primitive social organization: an evolutionary perspective'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Peter Vayda, ed. 1969 ''Environment and cultural behavior: ecological studies in cultural anthropology'' Garden City: Natural History Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Most promoted materialist understandings of culture in opposition to the symbolic approaches of Geertz and Schneider.  Harris, Rappaport, and Vayda were especially important for their contributions to [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and [[ecological anthropology]], both of which argued that "culture" constituted an extra-somatic (or non-biological) means through which human beings could adapt to life in drastically differing physical environments.

The debate between symbolic and materialist approaches to culture dominated American anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s.  The [[Vietnam War]] and the publication of [[Dell Hymes]]' ''Reinventing Anthropology'', however, marked a growing dissatisfaction with the then dominant approaches to culture.  Hymes argued that fundamental elements of the Boasian project such as holism and an interest in diversity were still worth pursuing: "interest in other peoples and their ways of life, and concern to explain them within a frame of reference that includes ourselves."{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=11}}  Moreover, he argued that cultural anthropologists are singularly well-equipped to lead this study (with an indirect rebuke to sociologists like Parsons who sought to subsume anthropology to their own project):

{{quote|In the practice there is a traditional place for openness to phenomena in ways not predefined by theory or design&amp;nbsp;– attentiveness to complex phenomena, to phenomena of interest, perhaps aesthetic, for their own sake, to the sensory as well as intellectual, aspects of the subject.  These comparative and practical perspectives, though not unique to formal anthropology, are specially husbanded there, and might well be impaired, if the study of man were to be united under the guidance of others who lose touch with experience in concern for methodology, who forget the ends of social knowledge in elaborating its means, or who are unwittingly or unconcernedly culture-bound.|{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=42}}}}

It is these elements, Hymes argued, that justify a "general study of man," that is, "anthropology".{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=43}}

During this time notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf eventually broke away; experimenting with [[Structuralism|structuralist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] approaches to culture, they continued to promote cultural anthropology against structural functionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Mintz 1985 ''Sweetness and Power'' New York: Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Murphy 1971 ''The Dialectics of Social Life'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins 1976 ''Culture and Practical Reason''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1971 ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf, 1982 ''Europe and the People Without History'' Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local versus global ===

[[File:Taiwanese aborigines.JPG|thumb|[[Taiwanese aborigines]] dancing]]

Boas and Malinowski established ethnographic research as a highly localized method for studying culture.  Yet Boas emphasized that culture is dynamic, moving from one group of people to another, and that specific cultural forms have to be analyzed in a larger context.  This has led anthropologists to explore different ways of understanding the global dimensions of culture.

In the 1940s and 1950s, several key studies focused on how trade between indigenous peoples and the Europeans who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change in the organization of labor, or change in critical technologies. [[Bernard Mishkin]] studied the effect of the introduction of horses on [[Kiowa]] political organization and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkin, Bernard 1940 ''Rank and Warfare in Plains Indian Culture.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 3.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Lewis]] explored the influence of the fur trade on [[Blackfoot Indians|Blackfoot]] culture (relying heavily on historical sources).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Oscar 1942  ''The Effects of White Contact upon Blackfoot Culture, with Special Reference to the Role of the Fur Trade.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 6.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jablow]] documented how [[Cheyenne]] social organization and subsistence strategy between 1795 and 1840 were determined by their position in trade networks linking Whites and other Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Jablow, Joseph 1951 ''The Cheyenne in Plains Indian Trade Relations, 1795–1972.''  American Ethnological Society Monograph 19.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Secoy]] argued that [[Great Plains]] Indians' social organization and military tactics changed as horses, introduced by the Spanish in the south, diffused north, and guns, introduced by the British and French in the east, diffused west.&lt;ref&gt;Secoy, Frank 1953  ''Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains (17th Century through Early 19th Century).'' American Ethnological Society Monograph 21, New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mexico.Mor.Tepoztlan.01.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[El Tepozteco|Tepozteco]] mountain dominates views from Tepoztlán.]]
In the 1950s, [[Robert Redfield]] and students of [[Julian Steward]] pioneered "community studies," namely, the study of distinct communities (whether identified by race, ethnicity, or economic class) in Western or "Westernized" societies, especially cities.  They thus encountered the antagonisms 19th century critics described using the terms "high culture" and "low culture."  These 20th-century anthropologists struggled to describe people who were politically and economically inferior but not, they believed, culturally inferior. [[Oscar Lewis]] proposed the concept of a "culture of poverty" to describe the cultural mechanisms through which people adapted to a life of economic poverty.  Other anthropologists and sociologists began using the term "sub-culture" to describe culturally distinct communities that were part of larger societies.

One important kind of subculture is that formed by an immigrant community.  In dealing with immigrant groups and their cultures, there are various approaches:
* [[Leitkultur]] (core culture): A model developed in Germany by [[Bassam Tibi]]. The idea is that minorities can have an identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.
* [[Melting pot]]: In the [[United States]], the traditional view has been one of a melting pot where all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.
* [[Monoculturalism]]: In some European states, culture is very closely linked to [[nationalism]], thus government policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.
* [[Multiculturalism]]: A policy that immigrants and others should preserve their cultures with the different cultures interacting peacefully within one nation.

The way nation states treat immigrant cultures rarely falls neatly into one or another of the above approaches.  The degree of difference with the host culture (i.e., "foreignness"), the number of immigrants, attitudes of the resident population, the type of government policies that are enacted, and the effectiveness of those policies all make it difficult to generalize about the effects. Similarly with other subcultures within a society, attitudes of the mainstream population and communications between various cultural groups play a major role in determining outcomes.  The study of cultures within a society is complex and research must take into account a myriad of variables.

However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length, the [[parsec]].

== History of symbol usage ==
A variety of unit symbols and abbreviations have been in use for the astronomical unit. In a 1976 resolution, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) used the symbol ''A'' for the astronomical unit.&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; In the astronomical literature, the symbol AU was (and remains) common. In 2006, the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) recommended ua as the symbol for the unit.&lt;ref name="Bureau International des Poids et Mesures 2006 126"&gt;{{Citation |author=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures | author-link = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |title=The International System of Units (SI) |place= |publisher=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du Mètre |date=2006 |edition=8th |page=126 |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-normative Annex C to [[ISO 80000-3]] (2006), the symbol of the astronomical unit is "ua". In 2012, the IAU, noting "that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit", recommended the use of the symbol "au".&lt;ref name="IAUresB2" /&gt; In the 2014 revision of the SI Brochure, the BIPM used the unit symbol "au".&lt;ref name="AAS_style"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aas.org/authors/manuscript-preparation-aj-apj-author-instructions#_Toc2.2 | title= Manuscript Preparation: AJ &amp; ApJ Author Instructions | website=American Astronomical Society | accessdate=29 October 2016 | quote="Use standard abbreviations for SI... and natural units (e.g., au, pc, cm)."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI_Brochure2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table6.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) [8th edition, 2006; updated in 2014] |publisher=BIPM |date=2014 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of unit definition ==
{{See also|Earth's orbit}}

[[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun is an [[ellipse]]. The [[semi-major axis]] of this [[elliptic orbit]] is defined to be half of the straight [[line segment]] that joins the [[perihelion and aphelion]]. The centre of the Sun lies on this straight line segment, but not at its midpoint. Because ellipses are well-understood shapes, measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically, and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation. In addition, it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance that Earth traverses over the course of a year, defining times and places for observing the largest [[parallax]] (apparent shifts of position) in nearby stars. Knowing Earth's shift and a star's shift enabled the star's distance to be calculated. But all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty, and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances. Improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding. Throughout the twentieth century, measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated, and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[theory of relativity]] and upon the mathematical tools it used.

Improving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of improved understanding of the laws of [[celestial mechanics]], which govern the motions of objects in space. The expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated (in AU) from these laws, and assembled into a collection of data called an [[ephemeris]]. [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] HORIZONS System provides one of several ephemeris computation services.&lt;ref name=Horizons&gt;{{citation |title=HORIZONS System |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons |work=Solar system dynamics |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |publisher=NASA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit, the IAU formally [[IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants|adopted a new definition]]. Although directly based on the then-best available observational measurements, the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides. It stated that "the astronomical unit of length is that length (''A'') for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time".&lt;ref name="IAU76"&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trümper"&gt;{{Citation |title=Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology — Volume VI/4B ''Solar System'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=wgydrPWl6XkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA4 |page=4 |date=2009 |author1=H.

Subsequent explorations of the Solar System by [[space probe]]s made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the [[Solar System#Inner planets|inner planets]] and other objects by means of [[radar]] and [[telemetry]]. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [[photons]] to be reflected from an object. Because all photons move at the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is calculated as the product of the speed of light and the measured time. However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation. Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]] scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of {{val|86400|u=seconds}}). By 2009, the IAU had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements, and calculated the speed of light at {{val|173.1446326847|(69)|u=AU/day}} (TDB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf |chapter=Selected Astronomical Constants |title=The Astronomical Almanac Online |publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]] |page=K6 |date=2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132053/http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) modified the [[International System of Units]] (SI, or "modern" metric system) to make the metre defined as the distance travelled in a vacuum by light in 1/299792458 second. This replaced the previous definition, valid between 1960 and 1983, which was that the metre equalled a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. (The reason for the change was an improved method of measuring the speed of light.) The speed of light could then be expressed exactly as ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}, a standard also adopted by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]] numerical standards.&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;{{citation |title=Table 1.1: IERS numerical standards |work=IERS technical note no. 36: General definitions and numerical standards |editor=Gérard Petit |editor2=Brian Luzum |url=ftp://tai.bipm.org/iers/conv2010/chapter1/tn36_c1.pdf |publisher=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |date=2010}} For complete document see {{citation |title=IERS Conventions (2010): IERS technical note no. 36 |editor=Gérard Petit |editor2=Brian Luzum |isbn=978-3-89888-989-6 |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_11216/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn36.html |publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this definition and the 2009 IAU standard, the time for light to traverse an AU is found to be τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|499.0047838061|0.00000001|u=seconds}}, more than 8 minutes.

In 2006, the BIPM reported a value of the astronomical unit as {{val|1.49597870691|(6)|e=11|u=m}}.&lt;ref name="Bureau International des Poids et Mesures 2006 126" /&gt; In the 2014 revision of the SI Brochure, the BIPM recognised the IAU's 2012 redefinition of the astronomical unit as {{val|149597870700|u=m}}.&lt;ref name=SI_Brochure2012 /&gt; or an increase of 9 meters.

This estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error, and based on techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects, and thus were not constant for all observers.  In 2012, finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex, the IAU simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre (exactly {{val|149597870700|u=m}}).&lt;ref name=Captaine /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature2012&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-astronomical-unit-gets-fixed-1.11416 |title=The astronomical unit gets fixed: Earth–Sun distance changes from slippery equation to single number |journal=Nature |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.11416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new definition also recognizes as a consequence that the astronomical unit is now to play a role of reduced importance, limited in its use to that of a convenience in some applications.&lt;ref name=Captaine /&gt;

== Usage and significance ==
With the definitions used before 2012, the astronomical unit was dependent on the [[heliocentric gravitational constant]], that is the product of the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the [[solar mass]] {{Solar mass|link=y}}. Neither ''G'' nor {{Solar mass}} can be measured to high accuracy separately, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an [[ephemeris]], so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on Earth's surface ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer during the Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter during the Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the "planetary second" (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{val|0.9832898912}} and {{val|1.0167103335|u=AU}}) and, when Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and Earth is moving faster along [[Earth's orbit|its orbital path]]. As the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the "planetary metre" on a periodic basis.

The metre is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that "its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored".&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed,&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{citation |author=Huang, T.-Y. |author2=Han, C.-H. |author3=Yi, Z.-H. |author4=Xu, B.-X. |date=1995 |title=What is the astronomical unit of length? |bibcode=1995A&amp;A...298..629H |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=298 |pages=629–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "vigorous debate" ensued&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{citation |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |page=76 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&amp;pg=PA76 |chapter=§&amp;nbsp;6.2.3: Astronomical unit: ''Definition of the astronomical unit, future versions'' |isbn=978-0-521-76917-4}} and also p. 91, ''Summary and recommendations''.&lt;/ref&gt; until August 2012 when the IAU adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit = {{val|149597870700}} [[metre]]s.

The astronomical unit is typically used for [[stellar system]] scale distances, such as the size of a protostellar disk or the heliocentric distance of an asteroid, whereas other units are used for [[cosmic distance ladder|other distances in astronomy]]. The astronomical unit is too small to be convenient for interstellar distances, where the [[parsec]] and [[light-year]] are widely used. The parsec (parallax arcsecond) is defined in terms of the astronomical unit, being the distance of an object with a [[parallax]] of 1 [[arcsecond]]. The light-year is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit and is rarely used by professional astronomers.&lt;ref name=Dodd1&gt;{{citation |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |page=82 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&amp;pg=PA82 |chapter=§&amp;nbsp;6.2.8: Light year |isbn=978-0-521-76917-4 |date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When simulating a [[numerical model of the Solar System]], the astronomical unit provides an appropriate scale that minimizes ([[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]] and [[truncation]]) errors in [[floating point]] calculations.

== History ==
According to [[Archimedes]] in the ''[[Sand Reckoner|Sandreckoner]]'' (2.1), [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be {{val|10000}} times Earth's radius (the true value is about {{val|23000}}).&lt;ref name=Gomez&gt;Gomez, A. G. (2013) [http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000625467 '' Aristarchos of Samos, the Polymath''] AuthorHouse, {{ISBN|978-1481789493}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''[[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has long been ascribed to Aristarchus, says that he calculated the distance to the Sun to be between 18 and 20 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the Moon]], whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the [[Lunar phase|half moon]] and the Sun, which he estimated as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°). Depending on the distance that Van Helden assumes Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and {{val|1520}} Earth radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Van Helden |first=Albert |title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1985 |pages=5–9 |isbn=978-0-226-84882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' (Book XV, Chapter 53), [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the Sun to be "σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας" (literally "of ''stadia'' [[myriad]]s 400 and {{val|80000}}") but with the additional note that in the Greek text the [[Agreement (linguistics)|grammatical agreement]] is between ''myriads'' (not ''stadia'') on the one hand and both ''400'' and ''{{val|80000}}'' on the other, as in Greek, unlike English, all three (or all four if one were to include ''stadia'') words are [[Inflection|inflected]]. This has been translated either as {{val|4080000}} ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]'' (1903 translation by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]]), or as {{val|804000000}} ''stadia'' (edition of [[:de:Édouard des Places"Édourad|des Places"]], dated 1974–1991).

Toomer]], this was derived from his assumption of a "least perceptible" solar parallax of 7 arc minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1007/BF00329826 |title=Hipparchus on the distances of the sun and moon |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=126–142 |last1=Toomer |first=G.

A Chinese mathematical treatise, the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]'' (c. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places {{val|1000}} [[Li (length)|li]] apart and the assumption that Earth is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=G.

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the mean distance of the Sun as {{val|1210}} times [[Earth radius|Earth's radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses'' |journal=Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=1967 |pages=9–12 |doi=10.2307/1006040 |jstor=1006040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=van Helden |first=Albert |title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1985 |pages=15–27 |isbn=978-0-226-84882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′, which was much too large. He then derived a maximum lunar distance of {{sfrac|64|1|6}} Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.&lt;ref name=vh1619&gt;pp. 16–19, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 251, ''Ptolemy's Almagest'',
translated and annotated by G. J. Toomer, London: Duckworth, 1984, {{ISBN|0-7156-1588-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be {{val|1210}} Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.&lt;ref name=vh1619 /&gt;

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [[al-Farghānī]] gave a mean solar distance of {{val|1170}} Earth radii, whereas in his ''[[zij]]'', [[al-Battānī]] used a mean solar distance of {{val|1108}} Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as [[al-Bīrūnī]], used similar values.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 29–33, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Europe, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] also used comparable figures ({{val|1142}} and {{val|1150}} Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 41–53, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]] was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' (1627). [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [[Godefroy Wendelin]] repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]].&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;An extended historical discussion of this method is provided by {{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the [[parallax]] of Venus and from the relative distance of Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [[Parallax#Solar parallax|solar parallax]] ''α'' (which cannot be measured directly due to the brightness of the Sun&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{citation |last=Weaver |first=Harold F. |title=The Solar Parallax |bibcode=1943ASPL....4..144W |date=March 1943 |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |volume=4 |issue=169 |pages=144–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] had attempted to produce an estimate based on [[Transit of Venus, 1639|his observation of the 1639 transit]] (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 [[arcsecond]]s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] by
:&lt;math&gt;A = \cot\alpha \approx 1\,\textrm{radian}/\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and Earth: a solar parallax of 15" is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of {{val|13750}} Earth radii.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] believed that the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [[Mars]], he estimated a value of about {{val|24000}} Earth radii,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Goldstein |first=S. J. Jr. |title=Christiaan Huygens' Measurement of the Distance to the Sun |bibcode=1985Obs...105...32G |journal=Observatory |date=1985 |volume=105 |pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6". Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[[File:Venustransit 2004-06-08 07-44.jpg|thumb|right|Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so-called "[[black drop effect]]") and the rarity of observations.]]
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of {{sfrac|9|1|2}}", equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about {{val|22000}} Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as {{val|3269}} thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Another colleague, [[Ole Rømer]], discovered the finite [[speed of light]] in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or "light time per unit distance", a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and published in his ''[[Optica Promata]]'' (1663). It was strongly advocated by [[Edmond Halley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halley |first=E. |authorlink=Edmond Halley |date=1716 |title=A new Method of determining the Parallax of the Sun, or his Distance from the Earth |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=29 |issue=338–350 |pages=454–64 |url=http://www.dsellers.demon.co.uk/venus/ven_ch8.htm |doi=10.1098/rstl.1714.0056 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119120911/http://www.dsellers.demon.co.uk/venus/ven_ch8.htm |archivedate=19 November 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation including observations by James Cook and Charles Green from Tahiti. Despite the [[Seven Years' War]], dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pogge |first=Richard |title=How Far to the Sun?

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]]. [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of {{val|8.794143}}″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance), this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;Conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales, Paris, 18–21 May 1896&lt;/ref&gt; which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The name "astronomical unit" appears first to have been used in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hinks |first=Arthur R. |authorlink=Arthur Robert Hinks |title=Solar Parallax Papers No. 7: The General Solution from the Photographic Right Ascensions of Eros, at the Opposition of 1900 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=544–67 |date=1909 |bibcode=1909MNRAS..69..544H |doi=10.1093/mnras/69.7.544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another international project to measure the parallax of 433 Eros was undertaken in 1930–1931.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Spencer Jones |first=H. |authorlink=Harold Spencer Jones |title=The Solar Parallax and the Mass of the Moon from Observations of Eros at the Opposition of 1931 |journal=Mem. R. Astron. Soc. |volume=66 |date=1941 |pages=11–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mikhailov |first=A. A. |date=1964 |title=The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax |bibcode=1964SvA.....7..737M |journal=Sov. Astron. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=737–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|The ''astronomical unit'' is used as the baseline of the triangle to measure [[stellar parallax]]es ''(distances in the image are not to scale)''.]]

The unit distance ''A'' (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in terms of other [[astronomical constant]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;A^3 = \frac{G M_\odot D^2}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], {{Solar mass}} is the [[solar mass]], ''k'' is the numerical value of [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] and ''D'' is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Noerdlinger, Peter D. |arxiv=0801.3807 |title=Solar Mass Loss, the Astronomical Unit, and the Scale of the Solar System |journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]] |bibcode=2008arXiv0801.3807N |volume=0801 |date=2008 |pages=3807}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13286-astronomical-unit-may-need-to-be-redefined.html |title=AU may need to be redefined |newspaper=New Scientist |date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[speed of light]] has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant ''k'' is fixed in the [[astronomical system of units]], measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product ''G''{{Solar mass}} in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [[secular variation|secular increase]] in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +{{val|15|4}} metres per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Krasinsky, G. A. |author2=Brumberg, V. A. |title=Secular increase of astronomical unit from analysis of the major planet motions, and its interpretation |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |volume=90 |issue=3–4 |date=2004 |doi=10.1007/s10569-004-0633-z |pages=267–288|bibcode = 2004CeMDA..90..267K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{Citation |title=Astrometric Solar-System Anomalies;§&amp;nbsp;2: Increase in the astronomical unit |arxiv=0907.2469 |author1=John D.

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial.
Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit has not been estimated by the planetary ephemerides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |displayauthors=1 |first1=A. |last1=Fienga |last2=Kuchynka |first2=P. |last3=Manche |first3=H. |last4=Desvignes |first4=G. |last5=Gastineau |first5=M. |last6=Cognard |first6=I. |last7=Theureau |first7=G. |title=The INPOP10a planetary ephemeris and its applications in fundamental physics |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5456227385812m7/?MUD=MP |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |volume=111 |issue=3 |date=2011 |doi=10.1007/s10569-011-9377-8 |page=363 |bibcode=2011CeMDA.111..363F |arxiv=1108.5546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atomic astrophysics''' is concerned with performing [[atomic physics]] calculations that will be useful to [[astronomer]]s and using atomic data to interpret [[observational astronomy|astronomical observation]]s. Atomic physics plays a key role in [[astrophysics]] as astronomers' only information about a particular [[astronomical object|object]] comes through the light that it emits, and this light arises through [[transition rule|atomic transition]]s.

'''Molecular astrophysics''', developed into a rigorous field of investigation by [[astrochemistry|theoretical astrochemist]] [[Alexander Dalgarno]] beginning in 1967, concerns the study of [[emission spectrum|emission]] from [[molecule]]s in space. There are 110 currently known interstellar molecules. These molecules have large numbers of observable transitions. [[spectral line|Lines]] may also be observed in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]—for example the highly [[redshift]]ed lines seen against the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. High energy radiation, such as [[ultraviolet light]], can break the molecular bonds which hold atoms in molecules. In general then, molecules are found in cool astrophysical environments. The most massive objects in our [[Milky Way|galaxy]] are giant clouds of molecules and dust known as [[molecular cloud|giant molecular cloud]]s. In these clouds, and smaller versions of them, stars and planets are formed. One of the primary fields of study of molecular astrophysics is [[star formation|star]] and [[nebular hypothesis#formation of planets|planet formation]]. Molecules may be found in many environments, however, from stellar atmospheres to those of planetary satellites. Most of these locations are relatively cool, and molecular emission is most easily studied via [[photon]]s emitted when the molecules make transitions between low rotational energy states. One molecule, composed of the abundant carbon and oxygen atoms, and very stable against dissociation into atoms, is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The wavelength of the photon emitted when the CO molecule falls from its lowest excited state to its zero energy, or ground, state is 2.6mm, or 115 [[gigahertz]]. This frequency is a thousand times higher than typical FM radio frequencies. At these high frequencies, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can block transmissions from space, and telescopes must be located in dry (water is an important atmospheric blocker), high sites. Radio telescopes must have very accurate surfaces to produce high fidelity images.

On February 21, 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the [[universe]]. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">[[Image:Phoronid ASlotwinski.jpg|thumb|An example of zooplankton - Actinotroch larva of a phoronid worm, otherwise known as horseshoe worms]] The '''Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey''' is a joint project of the [[CSIRO]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/ Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Australian Antarctic Division,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aad.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division (AAD)&lt;/ref&gt; [[DEWHA]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/ Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor [[plankton]] communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans.

Plankton respond rapidly to changes in the ocean environment compared to other marine animals such as fish, birds and mammals, which makes them ideal biological indicators of ecosystem change. 

AusCPR was initiated in 2007 and funding has been secured initially for four years, although it is envisaged that the survey will continue well into the future. 

[[Image:Sahfos cpr.gif|thumb|Diagram showing the CPR]] 
The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: 

* map [[plankton]] [[biodiversity]] and distribution
* develop the first long-term [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] baseline for Australian waters
* document plankton changes in response to [[climate change]]
* provide indices for [[fisheries management]]
* detect [[harmful algal blooms]]
* validate satellite [[remote sensing]]
* initialise and test [[ecosystem models]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Aus CPR Routes.jpg|thumb|The AusCPR survey will initially operate two routes in Australian waters]] --&gt;The AusCPR survey uses the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] (CPR), a device developed by pioneering British marine biologist [[Sir Alister Hardy]]. In 1931, this device formed the basis of the ongoing CPR survey of the [[North Atlantic]]. This survey is one of the longest running marine biological surveys in the world, and many climate related changes in the plankton have been observed over the past 70 years. 

The design of the CPR has remained fundamentally unchanged over time as the simple yet robust design is a key to its success as an effective plankton sampler. The key to its success as a frequent basin-scale sampler is that the device is towed behind ships of opportunity (SOOPs) unaccompanied by scientists or research staff, making it a cost-effective sampling platform. The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830&amp;nbsp;km) per ‘tow’. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh. In the laboratory the silk is unrolled and phytoplankton and zooplankton are counted and identified.

Data generated by the survey will be made freely available according to the  Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)]  &lt;ref&gt;http://imos.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; data policy and will provide researchers and policy makers with environmental and climatic indicators on harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, pollution, climate change and fisheries. 

The AusCPR survey will collaborate with sister surveys, the [[SCAR Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey]] and the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] in the North Atlantic.

[[File:Big Crunch.gif|thumb|An animation of the supposed behaviour of a Big Crunch]]
{{cosmology}}
The '''Big Crunch''' is one of the theoretical scenarios for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], in which the [[metric expansion of space]] eventually reverses and the universe recollapses, ultimately causing the cosmic [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] to reach zero or causing a reformation of the universe starting with another [[Big Bang]].

Recent experimental evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed down by gravity but rather [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]]. However, since the nature of the [[dark energy]] that is postulated to drive the acceleration is unknown, a Big Crunch is still possible, although not observationally supported as of today.{{citation-needed|date=May 2018}}

== Overview ==

If the universe's expansion speed does not exceed the [[escape velocity]], then the mutual [[gravity|gravitational]] attraction of all its [[matter]] will eventually cause it to contract. If [[entropy]] continues to increase in the contracting phase (see [[Ergodic hypothesis]]), the contraction would appear very different from the time reversal of the expansion. While the early universe was highly uniform, a contracting universe would become increasingly clumped.&lt;ref name=HTUW&gt;{{cite AV media | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | year=2014 | publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually all matter would collapse into [[black hole]]s, which would then coalesce, producing a unified black hole or Big Crunch singularity.

The idea behind the theory is that the expansion of the universe is linked to the energy released in the [[Big Bang]], therefore the outward speed of the matter would decrease over time due to gravity (mutual attraction). This would act as ballast and would eventually lead to a halt of the expansion. As matter attracts and there is no matter beyond the maximum expansion point, eventually all matter would begin to travel inwards again, accelerating as time passes.

The exact details of the events that would take place before such final collapse depend on the length of both the expansion phase as well as the previous contraction phase; the longer both lasted, the more events [[Future of an expanding universe|expected to take place in an ever-expanding universe]] would happen; nonetheless it's expected that the contraction phase would not immediately be noticed by hypothetical observers because of the delay caused by the [[speed of light]], that the temperature of the [[cosmic microwave background]] would rise during contraction symmetrically compared to the previous expansion phase, and that the events that took place during the Big Bang would occur in opposite order.&lt;ref name="Davies1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Last Three Minutes: Conjectures About The Ultimate Fate Of The Universe |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |date=January 9, 1997 |isbn=978-0-465-03851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a contracting Universe similar to ours in composition it's expected that [[supercluster]]s would merge among themselves followed by [[galaxy cluster]]s and later galaxies. By the time stars were so close together that collisions among them were frequent, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background would have increased so much that stars would be unable to expel their internal heat, slowly ''cooking'' until they exploded, leaving behind a hot and highly heterogeneous gas, whose atoms would break down into their constituent subatomic particles because of the increasing temperature, that would be absorbed by the already coalescing black holes before the Big Crunch itself.&lt;ref name="Davies1994" /&gt;

The [[Hubble Constant]] measures the current state of expansion in the universe, and the strength of the gravitational force depends on the density and pressure of matter in the universe, or in other words, the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of the universe.  If the density of the universe is greater than the critical density, then the strength of the gravitational force will stop the universe from expanding and the universe will collapse back on itself&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt;—assuming that there is no repulsive force such as a [[cosmological constant]].  Conversely, if the density of the universe is less than the critical density, the universe will continue to expand and the gravitational pull will not be enough to stop the universe from expanding.  This scenario would result in the [[heat death of the universe]], where the universe reaches the maximum state of [[entropy]] that is [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. In the state of thermodynamic equilibrium energy in the universe is evenly distributed so [[heat transfer]] or any other [[energy transfer]] is impossible so no reactions can happen in such universe making it "dead".&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/WMAP_Universe.pdf Dr. Gary F. Hinshaw, ''WMAP Introduction to Cosmology''. NASA (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}} One theory proposes that the universe could collapse to the state where it began and then initiate another [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; so in this way the universe would last forever, but would pass through phases of expansion (Big Bang) and contraction (Big Crunch).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/the_universe/Crunch.html Jennifer Bergman, ''The Big Crunch'', Windows to the Universe (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another scenario results in a flat universe which occurs when the critical density is just right. In this state the universe would always be slowing down, and eventually come to a stop in an interminable amount of time. Although, it is now understood that the critical density has been measured and determined to be a flat universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fraser Cain|title=How Will The Universe End?|date=2013-10-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWnduAnxLQ4|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent experimental evidence (namely the observation of distant [[supernova]]e as [[standard candle]]s, and the well-resolved mapping of the [[cosmic microwave background]]) has led to conclusion that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed down by gravity but rather [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]]. However, since the nature of the [[dark energy]] that is postulated to drive the acceleration is unknown, it is still possible (though not observationally supported as of today) that it might eventually reverse its developmental path and cause a collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Y Wang, J M Kratochvil, A Linde, and M Shmakova, ''Current Observational Constraints on Cosmic Doomsday''.

The '''Cave of Dogs''' (in Italian ''Grotta del Cane'', literally "Cave of the Dog") is a small [[cave]] on the eastern side of the [[Phlegraean Fields]] near [[Pozzuoli]],  [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grotta del Cane: Italy|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-175146&amp;fid=3091&amp;c=italy|website=Geographical Names|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the cave is a [[fumarole]] that releases [[carbon dioxide]] of [[volcanic]] origin.  It was a famous, if gruesome, [[tourist attraction]] for travellers on the [[Grand Tour]].  The [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas, being denser than air, tends to accumulate in the deeper parts of the cave.  Local guides, for a fee, would suspend small animals inside it—usually dogs—until they became unconscious.  Because humans inhaled air from a higher level they were not affected.  The dogs might be revived by submerging them in the cold waters of the nearby [[Lake Agnano]].  Famous tourists who came to see this attraction included [[Goethe]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] père, and [[Mark Twain]]. The lake became polluted and it was drained in 1870; the spectacle fell into disuse and the cave was closed.  However the area is now being restored by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Alfred Swaine, An Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid, The London Medical and Physical Journal, 1832, 278-285.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eegEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=An+account+of+the+Grotta+del+Cane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uHmS5DBVLg&amp;sig=xizJ0VWyEyWaAedKYknv1pxUI0c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zMNVeeKIsvcapCcgoAC&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20account%20of%20the%20Grotta%20del%20Cane&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming &amp; Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective,  Pittsburgh, 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Matthews, Naples: Life, Death &amp; Miracles: Agnano &amp; the Grotto of the Dog.

The cave was often described in nineteenth century science textbooks to illustrate the [[density]] and toxicity of carbon dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;The above image is from L'air et le monde aèrien, an 1865 textbook by Arthur Mangin, p.162 [https://archive.org/details/lairetlemondear00manggoog]&lt;/ref&gt; and its reputation has given rise to a popular [[scientific demonstration]] of the same name.  Stepped candles are successively extinguished by tipping carbon dioxide into a transparent container.

The cave was recently investigated by Italian [[speleologists]] including Rosario Varriale who interpreted it as a man-made cavity constructed in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], possibly as a [[sudatorium]].

Creating a '''cellular model''' has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].
It involves developing efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools to orchestrate the integration of large quantities of biological data with the goal of [[computer modeling]].

It is also directly associated with [[bioinformatics]], [[computational biology]] and [[Artificial life]].

It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century.

==Overview==
The eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.
It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/lab_website/ |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellcycle.bme.hu/ |title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
By means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).&lt;br /&gt;
To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. &lt;br /&gt;
In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;
In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]] which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).&lt;br /&gt; A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a [[bifurcation diagram]] ([[bifurcation theory]]): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].

==Molecular level simulations==
Cell Collective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cellcollective.org/ | title=Interactive Modeling of Biological Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://helikarlab.org/members.html | title=Helikar Lab - Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science. The complexities of math and computer science are built into the backend and one can learn about the methods used for modeling biological species, but complex math equations, algorithms, programming are not required and hence won't impede model building.

The mathematical framework behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete) modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive information on logical modeling, see &lt;ref&gt;Morris MK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Sorger PK, Lauffenburger DA.. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry (2010) 49(15):3216–24.10.1021/bi902202q

Model validation
The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein interaction) information from the primary literature. In other words, during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed, verification of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this, the T-cell model was simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and analyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine whether the model behaves as expected, including various downstream effects as a result of activation of the TCR, G-protein-coupled receptor, cytokine, and integrin pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy BD, Herek TA, Shew TD, Latner M, Larson JJ, Allen L, et al.

In the July 2012 issue of [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], a team led by [[Markus W. Covert|Markus Covert]] at Stanford published the most complete computational model of a cell to date. The model of the roughly 500-gene ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' contains 28 algorithmically-independent components incorporating work from over 900 sources. It accounts for interactions of the complete [[genome]], [[transcriptome]], [[proteome]], and [[metabolome]] of the organism, marking a significant advancement for the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://covertlab.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/mgenitalium_whole_cell_2012_07_20.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/july/computer-model-organism-071812.html | title=Stanford researchers produce first complete computer model of an organism| date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attempts at modeling cell cycle processes have focused on the broad, complicated molecular interactions of many different chemicals, including several [[cyclin]] and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] molecules as they correspond to the [[S phase|S]], [[M phase|M]], [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of the [[cell cycle]]. In a 2014 published article in PLOS computational biology, collaborators at [[University of Oxford]], [[Virginia Tech]] and Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes produced a simplified model of the cell cycle using only one cyclin/CDK interaction. This model showed the ability to control totally functional [[cell division]] through regulation and manipulation only the one interaction, and even allowed researchers to skip phases through varying the concentration of CDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cell Cycle Control by a Minimal Cdk Network|journal = PLoS Comput Biol|date = 2015-02-06|pmc = 4319789|pmid = 25658582|pages = e1004056|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004056|first = Claude|last = Gérard|first2 = John J.|last2 = Tyson|first3 = Damien|last3 = Coudreuse|first4 = Béla|last4 = Novák}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model could help understand how the relatively simple interactions of one chemical translate to a cellular level model of cell division.

'''Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects''' is a process dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of [[conservation-restoration]] is undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]], especially when dealing with object of [[cultural heritage]]. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctioa.org/index.cfm?pi=GL&amp;gaction=list&amp;grp=C Ceramic Tile and Stone Standards]. Ctioa.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The cleaning, handling, storage, and in general treatment of ceramics is consistent with that of [[glass]] because they are made of similar [[oxygen]]-rich components such as [[silica]]tes.&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Margaret|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection.

Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-3174-5|pages=97–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration of ceramics ==
It is in the nature of all the materials used for construction to eventually degrade and deteriorate. Degradation of an object occurs as a result of the interaction between the environment or with the materials that form the object however, in the case of ceramics, environmental factors are the major cause. There are several ways in which ceramics break down physically and chemically.

Additionally the type of ceramic will affect how it will break down. Unfired clay, like [[mud]] and clay [[adobe]], is clay that is fired under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832&amp;nbsp;°F. This type of clay is water-soluble and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200&amp;nbsp;°C or 1832°-2192&amp;nbsp;°F. The firing makes the clay water [[insoluble]] but does not allow the formation of an extensive glassy or [[Glass|vitreous]] within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400&amp;nbsp;°C or 2192-2552&amp;nbsp;°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}} However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.

=== Physical degradation ===
Due to their fragility, damage to ceramics typically comes from mishandling and packing. However, other factors such as [[vandalism]], [[frost]], [[mold]], and other similar occurrences can also inflect harm.&lt;ref name="Buys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buys|first=Susan|title=The Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics|year=1993|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0 7506 0957 5|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manufacturing defects ====
Also known as inherent vice, the intrinsic instability of the fabric and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within the fabric of the material and therefore is a natural occurrence. [[Wear|Deterioration]] of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

==== Impact and abrasions ====
With its delicate nature, ceramics that have been used over a period of time will sustain cracks, nicks, and blemishes. Additionally in a museum environment, damages can occur from packing storing, and handling of objects.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.22}}

==== Frost ====
Damage can occur when ceramics are exposed to freezing temperatures and frost. The problem occurs when [[ice]] [[crystals]] form inside of the pores of the ceramic piece. The frost inside of the pores will exert pressure onto the fabric of the pottery and cause the material to crack and break.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.24}}

==== Mold growth ====
Opposite of frost is heat and humidity. When the humidity is high [[mold]]s can begin to form on ceramic, particularly ones in which there is no glaze. Spores of molds are found throughout the atmosphere and will attached to any organic residues nearby, such as ceramics. Earthenware ceramics are frequently affected due to their porosity and lack of glaze.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.25}}

=== Chemical degradation ===
{{About||Additional information on chemical degradation|Chemical decomposition}}
Chemical degradation of objects occurs not in the physical structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an undesired reaction. The degradation of the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken the stability of the object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.

==== Water ====
Water can dissolve or deform ceramics that have been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example [[Gypsum]] or [[calcite]]. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, [[carbon dioxide]] is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form [[calcium bicarbonate]] which is very soluble. Stagnant water is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

==== Soluble salts ====
A common degradation issue in ceramics involves [[soluble]] [[salts]]. Soluble salts can either enter the [[clay]] body from the environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to the components of the materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they [[crystallize]]. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Over time, the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

== Preventive care of ceramics ==
{{Main|Collections care}}
In the realm of conservation there are two distinct practices: non-interventive and active conservation. Non-interventive types of conservation are used to control the surrounding environment such as light, humidity, and temperature. Active conservation is when a conservator practices treatments to alleviate physical problems in the object such as fading, chipping, or breaks.

=== Display ===
Although ceramics are utilitarian, some pieces are made to be artwork and therefore displayed. Displaying an object improperly can cause damages either physical or chemically from the environment. One of the most common causes for damages is a ceramic piece falling over or off a shelf. To prevent this issue, many historic houses will line storage and display shelves with a thin layer of ethafoam ([[polyethylene]] foam) or [[bubble wrap]].&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.63}}

=== Storage ===
[[File:Ceramic ring housed in blue board box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|This ceramic ring is housed in a blue board box with an acrylic plastic lid. The ring is laid upon a layer of carved ethafoam to prevent it from shifting during handling.]]
Ceramics are very delicate in nature and damages can occur even when they are stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged is when they are stacked one inside the other. Unless this is part of the original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and [[humidity]] conditions. [[Pottery]] that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will help to keep any salts from [[efflorescing]] which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze.&lt;ref name=Bachmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|year=1992|publisher=Smithonsian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general ceramics are typically inert and are not sensitive to elevated light levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, as well as many other material types, in a stable temperature of 68&amp;nbsp;°F with ± 3°.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}} Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near windows, heaters, fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages.

Some storing materials can be harmful to ceramic objects. [[Wool]] [[felt]] attracts and harbors insects including [[moths]] and [[silverfish]] which can be potentially very harmful to other collection material types. [[Polyurethane]] foam deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.&lt;ref name="Craft"/&gt;{{rp|p.102}}

=== Handling ===
One of the cardinal rules in object handling is to treat every object as if it is fragile and easily breakable. Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components.&lt;ref name="Bachmann"/&gt;{{rp|p.98}}

== Removal of previous conservation actions ==
Damages also occur to ceramics from previous restoration. Although the intent was to repair the object for use or display, some dated practices are now known to increase damages either physically, from rivets or staples, or chemically, from old used adhesives that off-gas.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|p.61}}

=== Removal of surface coating ===
Overpaint is a technique that is used to cover imperfection on the surface of a ceramic piece. Differences can be seen to the naked eye due to discoloration, being matched poorly, and change in texture or gloss. subtle difference can also been seen by restorers by using lighting and magnification. Overpaint and surface coatings can be removed either mechanically or with the use of solvents.

Mechanical removal of overpaint include physical techniques to remove the coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, [[white spirit]], industrial methylated spirits ([[denatured alcohol]]), [[acetone]], and [[Dichloromethane]] which is usually found in the form of a commercial [[paint stripper]]. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.75–77}}

=== Removal of filling materials ===
Fill materials are used to fill in missing parts or breaks in a ceramic piece in order to stabilize the piece. A wide range of materials and techniques have been used to restore losses in ceramics. Today the most common filling materials are made from calcium-sulphate-based fillers or synthetic resins based on epoxy, acrylic, or polyester resin. These new resins are stronger and do not harm the object. Removing previous filling materials, either mechanically or chemically, and replacing them with new fillers can help keep the piece strong and stable.

Fillers can be removed physically by mechanical ways, depending on the filler material type.  Cement mortar can be chiselled away with a hammer and chisel gradually. Plaster is easily removed through mechanical methods such as chiselling and chipping away with sharp implements. Saws, drills, and other mechanical methods can be used to remove the bulk of protruding materials, however scratches, chips, and breaks can occur.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.77–78}}

A second option to removing filler material is chemically. Typically, chemical removal is used once the bulk of filler material is left and only a small portion is left.

Unlike adhesives, fills tend to be easier to remove and dismantle from ceramics. Plaster of Paris is one example of a fill that comes apart easily with warm.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.37}}

=== Removal of adhesives ===
[[Image:Minoan Ceramic 2.jpg|right|thumb|375px|A Minoan ceramic piece from the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion that has gone under restoration]]
The selection for the proper solvent is based on the identification of the adhesive itself. Every adhesive has a particular solvent that work best to break down its chemical composition. Color, hardness, and other physical properties will allow for identification of the adhesive. The adhesive can be soften once exposed, either in a liquid of [[vapor]] form, of the solvent for some time. The length of time depends on the solubility of the adhesive and the thickness of the joint. Porous bodies, low-fired clays, are sometimes pre-soaked in water to prevent the adhesive from being drawn back into the body once it joins with the removal solution. If the adhesive that is being removed is part of the support for the object, then supports, such as tissue paper or propping up the object, will be used to make sure the object does not sustain damages once the adhesive is removed. Sometimes if the adhesive is not softened enough if will remove part of the surface on the ceramic if pressure is applied. The information on solvents for specific adhesives are found below, under each adhesive section.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.78–79}}

== Cleaning ==
Removal of surface dirt and deposits is beneficial for the health and longevity of an object because it will prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces or weak chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as [[calcium salts]], can be strongly attached to a ceramic surface, especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically.

Not all ceramic pieces are dry when they need cleaning. Some ceramics, such as those that are excavated archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to do before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.

=== Mechanical methods ===
Mechanical methods include [[dust]]ing, picking and cutting, and abrading. Mechanical cleaning is typically much easier to control than chemical treatments and there is no danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered to the surface of the ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate [[vacuum cleaner]] with a soft, [[muslin]]-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.

Abrading is the process in which surface deposits are removed using [[abrasive]]s. Abrasives come in both solid and [[cream]] forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a [[rubber]] [[Dental drill#Dental burr|burr]] on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of [[insoluble]] surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have [[oil]], [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]], or [[bleach]] as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.86–87}}

=== Chemical methods ===
Chemical methods for cleaning ceramics involve water, solvents, acids, and alkalis. Prolonged soaking in water may be used as a conservation method. The goal is to either remove stains from the surface or to remove the soluble salts in the clay body.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

== Repair and restoration==
The repair and restoration of ceramics has occurred since ceramics were invented including fillings, adhesives, reinforcements, and even patch work. The history of ceramic repair is vast and ranges from different methods and methodologies. For example, in 16th century China, people would repair broken ceramics by using pieces from other objects to disguise the patch. A sixteenth-century manuscript describes the process of patching broken ceramics:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 16th century - "Old pieces of porcelain from any famous kiln such as censers lack ears or feet or if vases have damaged mouth rims one can use old bits to patch the old; and if one adds glaze and then bakes it is just the same as the old. But the colour is weak at the patch. Yet people prefer this to the new stuff. And if one uses the method of blowing the glaze on to the patched parts there is still less of a trace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=G|title=The Potteries of China|year=1951|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|}
 
Today there are new advances in ceramic restoration including consolidation, bonding, adhesives, dowels, rivets, and fillers.

=== Consolidation ===
Consolidation is the process in which the fabric of the ceramic is strengthened by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include [[isocyanates]], [[silanes]], siloxnes, and [[methyl methacrylate]]s, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.106}}

==== Adhesives ====
{{For|Additional information on Adhesives|Adhesive}}
[[File:Cattien ceramic bowl.png|right|thumb|275px|Repaired ceramic bowl from the National Museum of Vietnam History]]
A chemical compound that adheres or bonds items together, such as pieces of ceramic. In ceramic conservation there are several different types that range from natural to man-made adhesives. Conservators characterise the best [[adhesive]] as one which can be undone.

===== Animal glue =====
{{About||Additional information on Animal Glue|Animal glue}}
Animal glue is an adhesive that contains various animal parts such as bone, skin, or fish and is widely used. It is a soft adhesive and can appear white, but usually has a pale yellow or brown appearance. Animal glue is very soft and can easily be broken down and removed with warm water and steam.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Nigel|title=Porcelain: repair and restoration, a handbook|year=2002|publisher=The British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=0 7141 2757 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although easily reversible, the relative ease with which the glue breaks down makes it a less strong bonding method.

===== Shellac =====
{{About||Additional information on Shellac|Shellac}}
A widely used old adhesive that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive is very hard and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is [[Industrial methylated spirit]] or (IMA).&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}} Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot [[alcohol]]. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography.&lt;ref name="Koob 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Removal of Aged Shellac Adhesive from Ceramics|journal=Studies in Conservation|year=1979|volume=24|pages=134–135|doi=10.1179/sic.1979.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Epoxy resin =====
{{About||Additional information on epoxy Resin|Epoxy}}
This type of resin is typically used post-1930s and is an indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy is very hard but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin is an indication of aging. Warm to hot water or [[acetone]] are known to be the solvents of this adhesive.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.31}}

===== Rubber adhesives =====
{{About||Additional information on rubber adhesives|Rubber cement}}
Rubber cements are solutions of synthetic or natural rubber products in solvents, with or without resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic due to the nature of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including [[silver]], because it can cause discoloration.&lt;ref name="Hatchfield"/&gt;{{rp|p.99}} Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Vinyl acetate polymers =====
{{About||Additional information on Vinyl acetate polymers|Vinyl acetate}}
Vinyl acetate polymers include polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetal; all come from reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates are known to be acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead.&lt;ref name=Hatchfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatchfield|first=Pamela|title=Pollutants in the Museum Environment: Practical Strategies for Problem Solving in Design, Exhibition and Storage|year=2002|publisher=Archetype Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=1-873132-96-4|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Cellulose nitrate =====
{{About||Additional information on Cellulose nitrate|Nitrocellulose}}
There are early and modern forms of this adhesive. While both tend to tinge with yellow as they age, the early form tends to become more brittle than the modern version, which contains a [[plasticizer]] to make the compound more stable. As with many adhesives, acetone is generally used as a solvent, however IMS can also be used.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===== Paraloid B-72 =====
{{About||Additional information on Paraloid B-72|Paraloid B-72}}
B-72 is a [[thermoplastic]] resin that was created by Rohm and Haas for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for [[Flexographic ink]]. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.&lt;ref name=Koob&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koob|first=Stephen|title=The Use of Paraloid B-72 as an adhesive. Its application for archaeological ceramics and other materials|journal=Studies in Conservation|date=30 April 1986|volume=31|pages=7–14|doi=10.1179/sic.1986.31.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike cellulose nitrate, B-72 does not need additives like [[plasticizer]]s to stabilize its durability. Fumed [[colloidal silica]] is a chemical that can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.&lt;ref name="Koob"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

=== Dowels and rivets ===
[[Dowel]]s and [[rivet]]s are physical ways in which ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of [[wood]], [[metal]], or [[plastic]]. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive that is used to repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through dowels with a [[piercing saw]] and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.40}}

Riveting is a process in which holes are drilled in the surface of the ceramic, but does not go completely through the piece. The rivets are angled toward the joint and provide additional structural support.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.81}} There are two methods to removing rivets: the 'cut' and 'pull'. The 'cut' method consists of cutting the rivets through the middle with a file and then pulled out. The 'pull' method involves placing a thin blade under the rivet and pushing out any [[plaster]] packing. This method uses leverage to pull the rivet from the ceramic piece.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|p.38}}

=== Fillers ===
Fillers are used to replace gaps and losses from ceramic materials for either aesthetic reasons or for support. There are several different filler materials used in ceramics including [[plaster of Paris]] and other commercially available [[putties]] and fillers.

Plaster of Paris is a material that consists of [[calcium sulphate]] hemihydrate power and is produced by heating [[gypsum]] to 120&amp;nbsp;°C. The chemical formula is as follows: :CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''Heat'' → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·½H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  1½ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (released as steam). When mixed with water, an [[exothermic reaction]] occurs and forms a hard white filling similar to density of fired ceramics. Different grades of plasters are available and vary based on their particle size, setting time, density, expansion, and color.&lt;ref name="Buys"/&gt;{{rp|p.198}}

A thermoplastic [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[wax]] resin mixture developed by John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 can be used to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as [[alabaster]], [[marble]], [[calcite]], [[diorite]], and [[anhydrite]]. The mixture consists of [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVAC) AYAC, [[ethylene]] [[acrylic acid]] (EAA) [[copolymers]] A-C 540, and 580, [[antioxidants]] Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry [[pigment]]s, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are [[toxic]] and [[Poison|noxious]]. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.&lt;ref name=Wax&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gansicke|first=Susanne|author2=Hirx, John|title=The Translucent Wax-Resin Fill Material for the Compensation of Losses in Objects|journal=Journal of American Institute for Conservation|year=1997|volume=36|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1179/019713697806113648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retouching ===

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf.

Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}.

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson&lt;ref name="allourfutures"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=All our futures: Creativity, culture, education|year=1998|publisher=National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education|url=http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016051449/http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Craft&lt;ref name="Craft1" /&gt; have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Safiullina | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Intelligence, General Knowledge and Personality as Predictors of Creativity | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 532–535 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students.

S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175.

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R.

M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J.

New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement).

Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

The '''Economic and Social Research Council''' ('''ESRC''') is one of the seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It receives most of its funding from the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], and provides funding and support for research and training work in the [[social sciences]] and [[economics]], such as postgraduate degrees.

==Structure==
The ESRC is based at Polaris House in [[Swindon]], UK which is also the location of the head offices of several other UK Research Councils and [[Innovate UK]]. ESRC is part of [[United Kingdom Research and Innovation]] (UKRI)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukri.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;, an organisation that brings together the UK’s research councils, Innovate UK and [[Research England]]. UKRI is a [[non-departmental public body]] funded by a grant-in-aid from the [[UK government]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} &lt;ref name="ESRC what they do"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/what-we-do/|title = ESRC what they do|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ESRC's mission, according to its website, is to:&lt;ref name="mission, strategy and priorities"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/strategy-and-priorities/|title = ESRC mission, strategy and priorities|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* promote and support, by any means, high-quality research and related postgraduate training on social and economic issues
* develop and support the national data infrastructure that underpins high-quality research
* advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists who meet the needs of users and beneficiaries, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the UK, the effectiveness of public services and policy, and the quality of life
* communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science.

==History==
The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the ''Social Science Research Council'' (SSRC - not to be confused with the [[Social Science Research Council]] in the United States). The establishment of a state [[funding body]] for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the [[World War II|Second World War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ESRC's history|publisher = ESRC|date = December 2015|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable.

The first chief executive of the SSRC was [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included [[Michael Posner (economist)|Michael Posner]], later Secretary General of the [[European Science Foundation]]. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is [https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/directors/jennifer-rubin/ Professor Jennifer Rubin] who took over from Professor [[Jane Elliott (academic)|Jane Elliott]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = King's Professor Jennifer Rubin appointed ESRC Chief Executive|publisher = KCL|url = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/news/newsrecords/2017/King's-Professor-Jennifer-Rubin-appointed-ESRC-Chief-Executive.aspx|accessdate = 2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Change of name===
Following the election of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] asked [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to lead a review into the future of the SSRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Posner Obituary|publisher = The Independent|date = April 2009|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-posner-6107063.html|accessdate = 2015-12-03|location = London|first = Michael|last = Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SSRC/ESRC: the first forty years|publisher = ESRC|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/ssrc-and-esrc-the-first-forty-years/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnogeology''' is the study of how [[geological]] features were understood by ancient peoples around the globe from a "place-based" perspective, in specific reference to [[traditional knowledge]] and to the stories and ideas about the Earth that were passed down through traditions and the wisdom of elders.  The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of [[minorities]] and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole.  Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of [[philosophy]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], and [[geology]]. The term "ethnogeology" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1996, Of pipestone, thunderbird nests, and ilmenite: ethnogeology, myth, and the renaming of a world: Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 28, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, J., 1997, Ethnogeology and its implications for the aboriginal geoscience curriculum: Journal of Geoscience Education, v. 45, p. 117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth's history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).

One global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and [[arrowhead]]s.  Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools.  These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms.  Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with.  [[Flint]], [[obsidian]], [[chert]], [[copper]] and [[quartz]] were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.

In addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation.  Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade.  Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries.  Gold and silver are prized for jewelry and trade.  Good soil is needed for agriculture.  Mountains and rivers provided natural boundaries, defence, and borders for various political groups.

To elicit the silencing affect, ESSs recruit proteins that will negatively affect the core splicing machinery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Exonic splicing silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre-mRNA strands or promoting exon skipping. The single stranded pre-mRNA molecules need to have their [[intronic]] and exonic regions spliced in order to be translated. ESSs silence splice sites adjacent to them by interfering with the components of the core splicing complex, such as the [[SnRNP|snRNP's]], [[U1 spliceosomal RNA|U1]] and [[U2 spliceosomal RNA|U2]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative splicing and genetic diversity: silencers are more frequently modified by SNVs associated with alternative exon/intron borders|url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/12/4942|journal = Nucleic Acids Research|date = 2011-07-01|issn = 0305-1048|pmc = 3130264|pmid = 21398627|pages = 4942–4948|volume = 39|issue = 12|doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr081|first = Jorge E.

F.|last3 = Galante|first4 = Diogo|last4 = Meyer|first5 = Sandro J. de|last5 = Souza}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes proteins that negatively influence splicing to be recruited to the splicing machinery.

ESSs have four general roles:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* inhibiting exon inclusion
* inhibiting intron retention
* regulating alternative 5' splice site usage
* regulating alternative 3' splice site usage

== Role in genetic diseases ==

=== [[Myotonic dystrophy]] ===
Myotonic dystrophy (MD) is most noticeably caused by inheriting an unstable [[Trinucleotide repeat expansion|CTG triplet expansion]] in the [[Myotonin-protein kinase|DMPK gene]]. In healthy genotypes two isoforms of an insulin receptor mRNA transcript exist.The isoform [[Insulin receptor|IR-A]] lacks exon 11 and is expressed ubiquitously in cells. Isoform [[Insulin receptor|IR-B]] contains exon 11 and is expressed in cells of the liver, muscles, kidney, and adipocytes. In individuals with MD, IR-A is [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulated]] in high amounts in skeletal muscle leading to the disease phenotype.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Silencers regulate both constitutive and alternative splicing events in mammals|journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences CMLS|date = 2005-05-18|issn = 1420-682X|pages = 1579–1604|volume = 62|issue = 14|doi = 10.1007/s00018-005-5030-6|pmid = 15905961|first = U.|last = Pozzoli|first2 = M.|last2 = Sironi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESS nulceotide sequence exists within intron 10 and is thought to be dependent on the CUG triplet repeat in order to silence the splicing of exon 11. Silencing exon 11 splicing leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Cystic fibrosis]] ===
Mutations in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]] gene are responsible for causing [[cystic fibrosis]]. A particular mutation occurs in the CFTR pre-mRNA and leads to the exclusion of exon 9, mRNA lacking this exon folds a truncated protein (a protein shortened by a mutation).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Exclusion of exon 9 is mediated by a [[Locus (genetics)|polymorphic locus]] with variable TG repeats and stretches of T nucleotides – this is abbreviated as (TG)mT(n). This locus is an exonic splicing silencer and is located upstream of the exon 9 splice site (site 3c). The silencing is related to the high number of TG repeats and decreased stretches of T repeats (T tracts). A combination of both these factors is shown to increase levels of exon skipping.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[TARDBP|TDP-43]] protein is responsible for physically silencing the exon splicing site once it is recruited by the exonic splicing silencer (TG)mT(n). TDP-43 is a DNA binding protein and repressor, it binds to the TG repeat to cause exon 9 skipping. The role of the T tracts is not well understood.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Spinal muscular atrophy]] ===
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by the [[Zygosity|homozygous]] loss of the [[SMN1]] gene. Humans have two isoforms of the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene, SMN1 and [[SMN2]]. The SMN1 gene produces a complete transcript, while SMN2 produces a transcript without exon 7 which results in a truncated protein.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The ESS that contributes to the disease phenotype is the UAGACA nucleotide sequence. This sequence arises when a C-to-T mutation occurs at position +6 in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene.

Mutations in the [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]] gene are responsible for Ataxia telangiecstasia. These mutations are generally single base pair [[Point mutation|substitutions]], [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], or micro-insertions. A 4-nucleotide deletion within intron 20 of the ATM gene disrupts an exonic splicing silencer and causes the inclusion of a 65-nucleotide cryptic exon in the mature transcript. The inclusion of the cryptic exon results in protein truncation and atypical splicing patterns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Nuclear weapons}}

A '''fallout shelter''' is an enclosed space specially designed to protect occupants from radioactive debris or [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] resulting from a [[nuclear explosion]]. Many such shelters were constructed as [[civil defense]] measures during the [[Cold War]].

During a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground [[pumice]]. The fallout emits [[Alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, as well as [[gamma ray]]s.

Much of this highly radioactive material falls to earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant [[radioactive contamination|hazard]]. A fallout shelter is designed to allow its occupants to minimize exposure to harmful fallout until radioactivity has [[Radioactive decay|decayed]] to a safer level.

== History ==
[[File:Fallout shelter photo.png|thumb|Idealized American fallout shelter, around 1957.]]

=== North America ===
During the [[Cold War]], many countries built fallout shelters for high-ranking government officials and crucial military facilities, such as [[Project Greek Island]] and the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] in the United States and Canada's [[Emergency Government Headquarters]]. Plans were made, however, to use existing buildings with sturdy below-ground-level basements as makeshift fallout shelters. These buildings were [[placard]]ed with the orange-yellow and black [[trefoil]] sign designed by [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] director of administrative logistics support function [[Robert Blakeley|Robert W. Blakeley]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="rdmcfddnnyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html?_r=0 McFadden, Robert D. "Robert Blakeley, Whose Fallout Shelter Sign Symbolized the Cold War, Dies at 95," ''The New York Times'', Friday, October 27, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Emergency Alarm Repeater]] (NEAR) program was developed in the United States in 1956 during the [[Cold War]] to supplement the existing siren [[warning systems]] and radio broadcasts in the event of a [[nuclear attack]]. The NEAR civilian alarm device was engineered and tested but the program was not viable and was terminated in 1967.&lt;ref name=nearProgram&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode 709, Story 3: N.E.A.R Device|url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2011-05-22/709_near.pdf|website=pbs.com|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|accessdate=October 9, 2014|page=11|format=transcript|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. in September 1961, under the direction of [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs#Precedent|Steuart L. Pittman]], the federal government started the Community Fallout Shelter Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/commun.html|title=Civil Defense Museum-Community Shelter Tours Main Page|publisher=civildefensemuseum.com|accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywebtimes.com/archives/ottawa/display.php?id=366305|title=FALLOUT FEVER: Civil Defense shelters dotted area cities during the Cold War&amp;nbsp;– My Web Times|publisher=mywebtimes.com|accessdate=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from [[John F.

In November 1961, in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, an article by Gilbert Burck appeared that outlined the plans of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], [[Herman Kahn]], and [[Chet Holifield]] for an enormous network of concrete lined underground fallout shelters throughout the United States sufficient to shelter millions of people to serve as a refuge in case of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine November 1961 Pages 112–115 et al&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States ended federal funding for the shelters in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bearman|first1=Sophie|title=Thinking the unthinkable: Don’t rely on these historic fallout shelters in case of a nuclear attack|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/06/thinking-the-unthinkable-dont-rely-on-these-historic-fallout-shelters-in-case-of-a-nuclear-attack.html|accessdate=27 December 2017|publisher=CNBC|date=6 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, New York City began removing the iconic yellow signs since members of the public are unlikely to find viable food and medicine inside those rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Jonathan|title=New York City To Remove Misleading Nuclear Fallout Shelter Signs|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-city-nuclear-fallout-shleter-signs_us_5a43816ce4b025f99e18e04d?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009|accessdate=27 December 2017|agency=Reuters|publisher=Huffington Post|date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe and Russia ===
Similar projects have been undertaken in [[Finland]], which requires all buildings with area over 600&amp;nbsp;m² to have an NBC shelter, and [[Norway]], which requires all buildings with an area over 1000&amp;nbsp;m² to have a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/jd/xd-19950315-0254.html |title=FOR 1995-03-15 nr 254: Forskrift om tilfluktsrom |publisher=Lovdata.no |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Soviet Union]] and other Eastern Bloc countries often designed their underground mass-transit and subway tunnels to serve as bomb and fallout shelters in the event of an attack.

Germany has protected shelters for 3% of its population, Austria for 30%, Finland for 70%, Sweden for 81%, and Switzerland for 114%.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
[[File:Sonnenbergtunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Sonnenberg Tunnel]], in [[Switzerland]], was the world's largest civilian [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] fallout shelter, designed to protect 20,000 [[civilian]]s in the eventuality of war or disaster ([[civil defense]] function abandoned in 2006).&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frammery/&gt;]]

[[Switzerland]] built an extensive network of fallout shelters, not only through extra hardening of government buildings such as schools, but also through a building regulation requiring nuclear shelters in residential buildings since the 1960s (the first legal basis in this sense dates from 4 October 1963).&lt;ref name=Frammery&gt;{{fr}} Catherine Frammery, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/08/15/entrailles-sonnenberg-monstrueux-temoin-guerre-froide "Dans les entrailles du Sonnenberg, monstrueux témoin de la Guerre froide"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 15 August 2016 (page visited on 15 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the law ensured that all residential buildings built after 1978 contained a nuclear shelter able to withstand a blast from a 12 megaton explosion at a distance of 700 metres.&lt;ref name=wsj4&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Deborah|title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570|accessdate=December 18, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Federal Law on the Protection of the Population and Civil Protection'' still requires that every inhabitant should have a place in a shelter close to where they live.&lt;ref name=SWI&gt;{{fr}} Daniele Mariani, [http://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/a-chacun-son-bunker/7485678 "À chacun son bunker"], [[Swissinfo]], 23 October 2009 (page visited on 5 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss authorities maintained large communal shelters (such as the [[Sonnenberg Tunnel]] until 2006) stocked with over four months of food and fuel.&lt;ref name=wsj4/&gt; The reference ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' declared that, as of 1986, "Switzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85% of all its citizens."&lt;ref name=NWSS1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=6–10|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p911.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, there were about 300,000 shelters built in private homes, institutions and hospitals, as well as 5,100 public shelters for a total of 8.6 million places, a level of coverage equal to 114% of the population.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

In Switzerland, most residential shelters are no longer stocked with the food and water required for prolonged habitation and a large number have been converted by the owners to other uses (e.g., [[wine cellar]]s, ski rooms, [[gyms]]).&lt;ref name=wsj4/&gt; But the owner still has the obligation to ensure the maintenance of the shelter.&lt;ref name=SWI/&gt;

== Details of shelter construction ==

[[File:Big german fire door 1.png|thumb|Large fire door, sealing a fallout and air raid shelter inside the basement parking garage of a hotel in Germany.]]

=== Shielding ===
A basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|thickness]] of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.6&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&amp;nbsp;m (500&amp;nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher="The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness&amp;nbsp;– Hardened Shelters"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.&lt;ref name=NWSS6&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=37–45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm|quote="The 3-foot thickness of earth shown (or a 2-foot thickness of concrete) will provide an effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about 99.9%, of all gamma rays from fallout." "A right-angle turn, either from a vertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of about 90%." "...a large piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed over the mound. This waterproof material served as a "buried roof" after it was covered with more earth."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blast doors are designed to absorb the shock wave of a nuclear blast, bending and then returning to their original shape.&lt;ref name=lostworlds&gt;{{cite episode|title= Secret U.S. Bunkers|series=[[Lost Worlds (TV series)|Lost Worlds]]|network=The History Channel|date=August 29, 2007|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate control ===
Dry earth is a reasonably good thermal insulator, and over several weeks of habitation, a shelter will become dangerously hot.&lt;ref name=NWSS7/&gt; The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swing in the shelter's doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling. The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a [[Kearny air pump]], or KAP, named after the inventor, [[Cresson Kearny]])

Unfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice.&lt;ref name=NWSS7/&gt; Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter.&lt;ref name=NWSS7&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year= 1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=51–56 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p917.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters, however, incorporate [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]-filters for additional protection.

=== Locations ===
Effective public shelters can be the middle floors of some tall buildings or parking structures, or below ground level in most buildings with more than 10 floors. The thickness of the upper floors must form an effective shield, and the windows of the sheltered area must not view fallout-covered ground that is closer than 1.5&amp;nbsp;km (1&amp;nbsp;mi). One of Switzerland's solutions is to use road tunnels passing through the mountains, with some of [[Sonnenberg Tunnel|these shelters]] being able to protect tens of thousands.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|last=Foulkes|first=Imogen|title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm|accessdate=August 15, 2012|newspaper=BBC News, Switzerland|date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout shelters are not always underground. Above ground buildings with walls and roofs dense enough to afford a meaningful [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|protection factor]] can be used as a fallout shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Monteyne, David.

A battery-powered radio may be helpful to get reports of fallout patterns and clearance. However, radio and other electronic equipment may be disabled by [[electromagnetic pulse]]. For example, even at the height of the cold war, [[Electromagnetic pulse#Practical considerations for nuclear EMP|EMP protection]] had been completed for only 125 of the approximately 2,771 radio stations in the United States [[Emergency Broadcast System]]. Also, only 110 of 3,000 existing Emergency Operating Centers had been protected against EMP effects.&lt;ref name=NWSS4&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=24|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p914.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Broadcast System has since been supplanted in the United States by the [[Emergency Alert System]].

Inhabitants should have water on hand, 1-2 gallons per person per day. Water stored in bulk containers requires less space than water stored in smaller bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammes|first=JA|title=Fallout shelter survival research|year=1966|pages=154–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kearny fallout meter ====
Commercially made [[Geiger counter]]s are expensive and require frequent calibration. It is possible to construct an [[electroscope#Gold-leaf electroscope|electrometer]]-type radiation meter called the [[Kearny fallout meter]], which does not require batteries or professional calibration, from properly-scaled plans with just a coffee can or pail, gypsum board, [[monofilament fishing line]], and aluminum foil.&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter|year=1978|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325094514/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/112538.pdf|archivedate=March 25, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are freely available in the public domain in the reference ''[[Nuclear War Survival Skills]]'' by [[Cresson Kearny]].&lt;ref name=NWSS11&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=95–100|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p921.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Inhabitants should plan to remain sheltered for at least two weeks (with an hour out at the end of the first week&amp;nbsp;– see Swiss Civil Defense guidelines), then work outside for gradually increasing amounts of time, to four hours a day at three weeks. The normal work is to sweep or wash fallout into shallow trenches to decontaminate the area. They should sleep in a shelter for several months. Evacuation at three weeks is recommended by official authorities.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

If available, inhabitants may take [[potassium iodide]] at the rate of 130&amp;nbsp;mg/day per adult (65&amp;nbsp;mg/day per child) as an additional measure to protect the thyroid gland from the uptake of dangerous radioactive iodine, a component of most fallout and reactor waste.&lt;ref name=NWSS14&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=111–117|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p924.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different types of radiation emitted by fallout ==

=== Alpha (α) ===
In the vast majority of accidents, and in all [[atomic bomb]] blasts, the threat due to beta and gamma emitters is greater than that posed by the alpha emitters in the fallout. Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. [[Alpha particle]]s have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSC&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta (β) ===
[[Beta particle|Beta radiation]] consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about 10 feet (3 metres) of air or about {{frac|1|8}} inch (3 millimetres) of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSD/&gt;

The primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. [[Beta burn]]s can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.&lt;ref name=NWSSD&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |page=44 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gamma (γ) ===
[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma [[electromagnetic radiation|rays]]. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.

Some gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|halving thicknesses]] of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than {{frac|1|1000}} of unshielded exposure.&lt;ref name=NWSSE&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=11–20 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weapons versus nuclear accident fallout ==
The bulk of the [[radioactivity]] in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in [[fallout|weapons fallout]]. A good table of the [[nuclide]]s, such as that provided by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]], includes the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to [[fission products]] in bomb fallout).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Other matters and simple improvements ==
While a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of [[Radiation protection|fallout protection]].

=== Measures to lower the beta dose ===
The main threat of [[Radiation#Beta|beta radiation]] exposure comes from ''[[hot particle]]s'' in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause [[beta burn]]s. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other [[human decontamination|decontamination procedures]], on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion. The danger of gamma radiation will persist for far longer than the threat of beta burns in areas with heavy fallout exposure.&lt;ref name=NWSSA&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures to lower the gamma dose rate ===
The gamma dose rate due to the contamination brought into the shelter on the clothing of a person is likely to be small (by wartime standards) compared to [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma radiation]] that penetrates through the walls of the shelter.&lt;ref name=NWSSA/&gt; The following measures can be taken to reduce the amount of gamma radiation entering the shelter:
* Roofs and gutters can be cleaned to lower the dose rate in the house.
* The top inch of soil in the area near the house can be either removed or dug up and mixed with the [[subsoil]]. This reduces the dose rate as the gamma rays have to pass through the topsoil before they can irradiate anything above.
* Nearby roads can be rinsed and washed down to remove dust and debris; the [[fallout]] would collect in the sewers and gutters for easier disposal. In [[Kiev]] after the [[Chernobyl accident]] a program of road washing was used to control the spread of radioactivity.
* Windows can be bricked up, or the sill raised to reduce the hole in the shielding formed by the wall.
* Gaps in the shielding can be blocked using containers of water. While water has a much lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.
* Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped up against the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through a thicker layer of shielding before entering the house.
* Nearby trees can be removed to reduce the dose due to fallout which is on the branches and leaves. It has been suggested by the US government that a fallout shelter should not be dug close to trees for this reason.&lt;ref name=NWSSB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=39|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout shelters feature prominently in the [[Robert A. Heinlein]] novel ''[[Farnham's Freehold]]'' (Heinlein built a fairly extensive shelter near his home in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1963),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/pm652-art-hi.html site: Robert A. Heinlein&amp;nbsp;– Archives&amp;nbsp;– PM 6/52 Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5o2tUs7z7?url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/pm652-art-hi.html |date=2010-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pulling Through'' by [[Dean Ing]], ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' by [[Walter M. Miller]] and ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]]'' by [[David Brin]].

The 1961 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)|The Shelter]]", from a [[Rod Serling]] script, deals with the consequences of actually using a shelter. Another episode of the series called "[[One More Pallbearer]]" featured a fallout shelter owned by millionaire. The [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985 adaption of the series]] had the episode "[[Shelter Skelter]]" that featured a fallout shelter.

In the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' episode "[[The Russians Are Coming (Only Fools and Horses)|The Russians are Coming]]", Derek Trotter buys a lead fallout shelter, then decides to construct it in fear of an impending nuclear war caused by the Soviet Union (who were still active during the episode's creation).

In 1999 the film ''[[Blast from the Past (film)|Blast from the Past]]'' was released. It is a [[romantic comedy]] film about a [[nuclear physicist]], his wife, and son that enter a well-equipped, spacious fallout shelter during the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. They do not emerge until 35 years later, in 1997. The film shows their reaction to contemporary society.

The [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] of computer games depicts the remains of human civilization after an immensely destructive global nuclear war; the United States of America had built underground vaults that were advertised to protect the population against a nuclear attack, but almost all of them were in fact meant to lure [[Human subject research|subjects]] for long-term [[Unethical human experimentation|human experimentation]].

''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', a role-playing game, takes place in a form of fallout shelter, which has become ruled by an insane computer.

The ''[[Metro 2033 (book)|Metro 2033]]'' book series by Russian author [[Dmitry Glukhovsky]] depicts survivors' life in the subway systems below Moscow and Saint-Petersburg after a nuclear exchange between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.

Fallout shelters are often featured on the reality television show ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/doomsday-preppers/articles/get-prepped-shelter/ Shelter - Doomsday Preppers Article - National Geographic Channel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Silo (series)|Silo series]] of novellas by [[Hugh Howey]] feature extensive fallout-style shelters that protect the inhabitants from an initially unknown disaster.

'''Genetic hitchhiking''', also called '''genetic draft''' or the '''hitchhiking effect''',&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0016672300014634| pmid = 4407212| title = The hitch-hiking effect of a favourable gene| journal = Genetical Research| volume = 23| issue = 1| pages = 23–35| year = 1974| last1 = Smith | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is when an [[allele]] changes [[allele frequency|frequency]] not because it itself is under [[natural selection]], but because it is [[genetic linkage|near]] another gene that is undergoing a [[selective sweep]] and that is on the same [[DNA]] chain. When one gene goes through a selective sweep, any other nearby [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] that are in [[linkage disequilibrium]] will tend to change their [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] too.&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;Futuyma, Douglas J. 2013. Evolution: Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc: Sunderland, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Selective sweeps happen when newly appeared (and hence still rare) mutations are advantageous and increase in frequency. [[Neutral mutation|Neutral]] or even slightly deleterious alleles that happen to be [[genetic linkage|close by]] on the chromosome 'hitchhike' along with the sweep. In contrast, effects on a neutral locus due to linkage disequilibrium with newly appeared deleterious mutations are called [[background selection]]. Both genetic hitchhiking and background selection are [[stochastic]] (random) evolutionary forces, like [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="Gillespie 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillespie | first1 = John H | year = 2001 | title = Is the population size of a species relevant to its evolution? | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 2161–2169 | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00732.x | pmid=11794777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the term ''hitchhiking'' was coined in 1974 by [[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith]] and John Haigh,&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith"/&gt; the phenomenon it refers to remained little studied until the work of [[John H. Gillespie]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="genetics.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=John H.|title=Genetic Drift in an Infinite Population: The Pseudohitchhiking Model|journal=Genetics|date=2000|volume=155|issue=2|pages=909–919|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/909.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Hitchhiking occurs when a neutral polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with a second locus that is undergoing a selective sweep. The neutral allele that is linked to the adaptation will increase in frequency, in some cases until it becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]] in the population. The other neutral allele, which is linked to the non-advantageous version, will decrease in frequency, in some cases until [[extinction]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Genetics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreitman|first1=Marty|title=Hitchhiking Effect|journal=Encyclopedia of Genetics|date=2001|pages=952–953|doi=10.1006/rwgn.2001.0619|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122270800006194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay and Wu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fay | first1 = Justin C. | last2 = Wu | first2 = Chung-I. | year = 2000 | title = Hitchhiking Under Positive Darwinian Selection | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 155 | issue = 3| pages = 1405–1413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, hitchhiking reduces the amount of genetic variation.

Deleterious "passenger" mutations can also hitchhike, not just neutral mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=B. H.|last2=Desai|first2=M. M.|title=Deleterious Passengers in Adapting Populations|journal=Genetics|date=5 September 2014|volume=198|issue=3|pages=1183–1208|doi=10.1534/genetics.114.170233|pmid=25194161|pmc=4224160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recombination can interrupt the process of genetic hitchhiking, ending it before the hitchhiking neutral or deleterious allele becomes fixed or goes extinct.&lt;ref name="Fay and Wu"/&gt; The closer a hitchhiking polymorphism is to the gene under selection, the less opportunity there is for recombination to occur. This leads to a reduction in genetic variation near a selective sweep that is greater closer to the selected site.&lt;ref name="Braverman et. al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braverman | first1 = John M. | last2 = Hudson | first2 = Richard R. | last3 = Kaplan | first3 = Norman L. | last4 = Langley | first4 = Charles H. | last5 = Barton | first5 = Wolfgang | year = 1995 | title = The Hitchhiking Effect on the Site Frequency Spectrum of DNA Polymorphisms | url = | journal = Genetics Society of America | volume = 140 | issue = 2| pages = 783–797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is useful for using population data to detect selective sweeps, and hence to detect which genes have been under very recent selection.

==Draft versus drift==
Both [[genetic drift]] and genetic draft are random evolutionary processes, i.e. they act stochastically and in a way that is not correlated with selection at the gene in question. Drift is the change in the frequency of an allele in a population due to random sampling in each generation.&lt;ref name="Masel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masel | first1 = J | year = 2011 | title = Genetic drift | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 20| pages = 837–838 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 | pmid=22032182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draft is the change in the frequency of an allele due to the randomness of what other non-neutral alleles it happens to be found in [[linkage disequilibrium|association]] with.

Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after one generation in many replicated [[idealised population]]s each of size N, each starting with allele frequencies of p and q, the newly added variance in allele frequency across those populations (i.e. the degree of randomness of the outcome) is &lt;math&gt; \frac{pq}{2N} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gillespie 2001"/&gt; This equation shows that the effect of genetic drift is heavily dependent on population size, defined as the actual number of individuals in an [[idealised population]]. Genetic draft results in similar behavior to the equation above, but with an [[effective population size]] that may have no relationship to the actual number of individuals in the population.&lt;ref name="Gillespie 2001"/&gt; Instead, the effective population size may depend on factors such as the recombination rate and the frequency and strength of beneficial mutations. The increase in variance between replicate populations due to drift is independent, whereas with draft it is autocorrelated, i.e. if an allele frequency goes up because of genetic drift, that contains no information about the next generation, whereas if it goes up because of genetic draft, it is more likely to go up than down in the next generation.&lt;ref name="Masel"/&gt; Genetic draft generates a different [[allele frequency spectrum]] to genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neher|first1=R. A.|last2=Shraiman|first2=B. I.|title=Genetic Draft and Quasi-Neutrality in Large Facultatively Sexual Populations|journal=Genetics|date=30 May 2011|volume=188|issue=4|pages=975–996|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.128876|pmid=21625002|pmc=3176096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Sex chromosomes===
The Y chromosome does not undergo [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], making it particularly prone to the fixation of deleterious mutations via hitchhiking. This has been proposed as an explanation as to why there are so few functional genes on the Y chromosome.&lt;ref name="Rice 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = WR | year = 1987 | title = Genetic hitchhiking and the evolution of reduced genetic activity of the Y sex chromosome | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 116 | issue = 1| pages = 161–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutator evolution===
Hitchhiking is necessary for the evolution of higher [[mutation rate]]s to be favored by natural selection on [[evolvability]]. A hypothetical mutator M increases the general [[mutation|mutation rate]] in the area around it. Due to the increased mutation rate, the nearby A allele may be mutated into a new, advantageous allele, A*

--M------A-- -&gt; --M------A*--

The individual in which this chromosome lies will now have a selective advantage over other individuals of this species, so the allele A* will spread through the population by the normal processes of [[evolution|natural selection]]. M, due to its proximity to A*, will be dragged through into the general population. This process only works when M is very close to the allele it has mutated. A greater distance would increase the chance of recombination separating M from A*, leaving M alone with any deleterious mutations it may have caused. For this reason, evolution of mutators is generally expected to happen largely in [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] species where recombination cannot disrupt linkage disequilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andre|first1=J.-B.|title=The Evolution of Mutation Rate in Finite Asexual Populations|journal=Genetics|date=11 October 2005|volume=172|issue=1|pages=611–626|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.046680|pmc=1456187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutral theory of molecular evolution===
The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] assumes that most new mutations are either deleterious (and quickly purged by selection) or else neutral, with very few being adaptive. It also assumes that the behavior of neutral allele frequencies can be described by the mathematics of genetic drift. Genetic hitchhiking has therefore been viewed as a major challenge to neutral theory, and an explanation for why genome-wide versions of the [[McDonald-Kreitman test]] appear to indicate a high proportion of mutations becoming fixed for reasons connected to selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hahn|first1=Matthew W.|title=Toward a selection theory of molecular evolution|journal=Evolution|date=February 2008|volume=62|issue=2|pages=255–265|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00308.x|pmid=18302709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13720">The '''Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation''' is the country's largest statewide, nonprofit preservation organization with more than 8,000 members. Founded in 1973, the Trust is committed to preserving and enhancing Georgia’s communities and their diverse historic resources for the education and enjoyment of all.

The Georgia Trust generates community revitalization by finding buyers for endangered properties acquired by its ''Revolving Fund''; encourages neighborhood revitalization and provides design assistance to 105 Georgia ''Main Street'' cities; trains Georgia’s teachers to engage students in 61 Georgia school systems to discover state and national history through their local historic resources; and advocates for funding, tax incentives and other laws aiding preservation efforts.  The Georgia Trust is a recipient of the Trustees Award for Organizational Excellence from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatsnew/boilerplate.htm]

[[Image:Rhodes Hall Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodes Hall]] serves as the headquarters for the Georgia Trust.]]
The Georgia Trust operates two historic house museums:
* [[Johnston-Felton-Hay House|Hay House]], 1859, Macon
* [[Rhodes Hall]], 1904, Atlanta

== Georgia Trust Programs ==
In addition to providing preservation resources for individuals and communities throughout the state, The Georgia Trust helps save endangered houses and buildings, uncover the beauty of downtown buildings, educate the next preservation generation, and advocate for preservation funding and laws through the following programs:

=== Revolving Fund for Endangered Properties ===
The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation established the Revolving Fund for endangered properties in 1990 to provide effective alternatives to demolition or neglect of architecturally and historically significant properties by promoting rehabilitation and enabling owners of endangered historic properties to connect with buyers who will rehabilitate their properties.

The Revolving Fund accomplishes this goal by either accepting property donations or by purchasing options on endangered historic properties. The properties are then marketed nationally to locate buyers who agree to preserve and maintain the structures. Protective covenants are attached to the deeds to ensure that the historic integrity of each property is retained, and purchasers are required to sign rehabilitation agreements based on the work to be performed on the structure.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/revolving_fund.htm]

=== Main Street Design Assistance Program ===
Since the Main Street program's start in 1980, The Georgia Trust has offered design assistance, on-site rehabilitation consultations, hands-on presentations and hand-drawn and digital renderings to help business owners and downtown managers rehabilitate and reuse their historic resources.

Services provided by The Georgia Trust's Main Street Design Assistance Program have become integral to downtown revitalization efforts. Supported by the Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Office of Downtown Development, the program has assisted more than 3,000 business owners in 105 Main Street cities across Georgia to encourage the rehabilitation of historic downtown commercial buildings. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/main_streetda.htm]

=== Talking Walls ===
A recipient of a Governor's Award in the Humanities, the Talking Walls heritage education program has trained more than 1,700 teachers, who have reached more than 370,000 students in 61 school systems in Georgia since 1991. The program's teacher workshops and ongoing local support trains educators to use local historic resources such as photos, maps, oral histories and historic buildings as teaching tools in Georgia's mandated curriculum.

The Georgia Department of Education recently emphasized the Trust's key role as an important educational resource by approving the Trust as a partner in its Educational Initiatives Program. This status recognizes The Georgia Trust as an official collaborator with the DOE to provide quality instructional materials to educators across the state. Talking Walls also received statewide certification by the Georgia DOE, allowing the Trust to award professional recertification credits to teachers attending program workshops. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/talking_walls.htm]

=== Georgians for Preservation Action ===
Founded in 1987, the statewide coordinating council for historic preservation advocacy encourages laws, programs and policies that promote the preservation of Georgia’s historic resources by mobilizing grassroots preservationists across the state.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/georgians_preservation_action.htm]

Among its activities, GaPA:

* Annually develops and advocates a legislative agenda that represents a consensus of the leaders of key preservation constituencies on preservation issues. 
* Regularly communicates with historic preservation advocates about critical issues and legislation before the General Assembly. 
* Hosts a Legislative Reception for preservation supporters to meet with legislators. 
* Provides GaPA members with information on national preservation issues with news from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and Preservation Action, the national lobbying arm for historic preservation.

== ''Places in Peril'' ==
The Georgia Trust releases an annual list of endangered historic sites throughout Georgia. The ''Places in Peril'' program seeks to identify significant historic, archaeological and cultural properties that are threatened by demolition, deterioration or insensitive public policy or development, and have a demonstrable level of community interest, commitment and support. Through this program, the Trust encourages owners and individuals, organizations and communities to employ preservation tools, partnerships and resources necessary to preserve and utilize selected historic properties in peril.

Historic properties are selected for listing based on several criteria. Sites must be listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the Georgia Register of Historic Places and must be subject to a serious threat to their existence or historical, architectural and/or archeological integrity. There must also be a demonstrable level of community commitment and support for the preservation of listed sites.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/preservation_resources/places_in_peril.htm]

== Publications ==

=== ''The Rambler'' ===

The ''Rambler'' is The Georgia Trust's quarterly publication. It is distributed to members of The Georgia Trust from around the state and to other state and national preservation organizations.

=== ''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' ===

Architect J. Neel Reid (and his partners in Hentz, Reid &amp; Adler) founded the Georgia school of classicists after study at Columbia University and abroad. Many sources influenced Reid’s architecture, and his interior and garden designs. His travel diary, sketchbooks and scrapbooks, and extensive library reflect this. His early-twentieth-century interest in historic preservation and contextual design, in architectural education and professional standards of practice inspired others long after his tragic early death of a brain tumor in 1926.

Reid’s father’s family were Troup County, Georgia, pioneers; he grew up in Macon, beginning apprenticeship and practice there before, in 1909, moving to Atlanta.

''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' by William R. Mitchell, Jr. and published by The Georgia Trust, gives new life to Reid’s rich legacy, keeping his influence fresh in this new century. The J. Neel Reid Prize, provided by a Georgia Trust fund produced from the sale of the book, helps ensure continuation of Reid’s influence among a new generation of architects.

Proceeds from book sales help support the J. Neel Reid Prize, a yearly award to an architecture student, an architect intern or a recently registered architect for study travel that honors the legacy of Neel Reid.

=== ''Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol'' ===

Written by Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee with photographs by Diane Kirkland, the award-winning ''Democracy Restored'' is a stunning and fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capital that not only pays tribute to a grand ole edifice, but also vividly recounts the history that was made—and that continues to be made—within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times, solemn funeral processions.

Proceeds go to The Georgia Trust and the Capitol Restoration Fund.

The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The term '''hybrid neural network''' can have two meanings: 
#[[biological neural networks]] interacting with [[artificial neural network|artificial neuronal models]], and
#[[Artificial neural networks]] with a [[Computationalism|symbolic]] part (or, conversely, symbolic computations with a [[Connectionism|connectionist]] part). 

As for the first meaning, the [[artificial neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in hybrid networks can be [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog circuit|analog]]. For the digital variant [[voltage clamp]]s are used to monitor the [[membrane potential]] of [[neuron]]s, to computationally simulate artificial neurons and synapses and to stimulate biological neurons by inducing synaptic. For the analog variant, specially designed electronic circuits connect to a network of living neurons through electrodes. 

As for the second meaning, incorporating elements of symbolic computation and artificial neural networks into one model was an attempt to combine the advantages of both paradigms while avoid the shortcomings. Symbolic [[Knowledge representation|representation]]s have advantages with respect to explicit, direct control, fast initial coding, dynamic variable binding and knowledge abstraction. Representations of artificial neural networks, on the other hand, show advantages for biological plausibility, learning, robustness (fault-tolerant processing and graceful decay), and generalization to similar input. Since the early 1990s many attempts have been made to reconcile the two approaches.

'''Infrared open-path''' gas detectors send out a beam of [[infrared]] light, detecting gas anywhere along the path of the beam. This linear 'sensor' is typically a few metres up to a few hundred metres in length. Open-path detectors can be contrasted with [[infrared point sensor]]s.

They are widely used in the [[petroleum industry|petroleum]] and [[petrochemical]] industries, mostly to achieve very rapid [[gas leak detection]] for flammable gases at concentrations comparable to the [[lower flammable limit]] (typically a few percent by volume). They are also used, but so far to a lesser extent, in other industries where flammable concentrations can occur, such as in [[coal mining]] and [[water treatment]]. In principle the technique can also be used to detect [[toxicity|toxic]] gases, for instance [[hydrogen sulfide]], at the necessary parts-per-million concentrations, but the technical difficulties involved have so far prevented widespread adoption for toxic gases.

Usually, there are separate transmitter and receiver units at either end of a straight beam path. Alternatively, the source and receiver are combined, and the beam bounced off a [[retroreflector]] at the far end of the measurement path. For portable use, detectors have also been made which use the natural [[albedo]] of surrounding objects in place of the retroreflector. The presence of a chosen gas (or class of gases) is detected from its [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of a suitable infrared wavelength in the beam. Rain, fog etc. in the measurement path can also reduce the strength of the received signal, so it is usual to make a simultaneous measurement at one or more reference wavelengths. The quantity of gas intercepted by the beam is then inferred from the ratio of the signal losses at the measurement and reference wavelengths. The calculation is typically carried out by a [[microprocessor]] which also carries out various checks to validate the measurement and prevent false alarms.

The measured quantity is the sum of all the gas along the path of the beam, sometimes termed the ''path-integral concentration'' of the gas. Thus the measurement has a natural bias (desirable in many applications) towards the total size of an unintentional gas release, rather than the concentration of the gas that has reached any particular point. Whereas the natural units of measurement for an [[Infrared point sensor]] are parts-per-million (ppm) or the percentage of the lower flammable limit (%LFL), the natural units of measurement for an open path detector are ''ppm.metres'' (ppmm) or ''LFL.metres'' (LFLm). For instance, the fire and gas safety system on an [[oil platform|offshore platform]] in the [[north sea oil|North Sea]] typically has detectors set to a full-scale reading of 5LFLm, with low and high alarms triggered at 1LFLm and 3LFLm respectively.

==Advantages and disadvantages versus fixed-point detectors==
An open path detector usually costs more than a [[Infrared point sensor|single point detector]], so there is little incentive for applications that play to a point detector's strengths: where the point detector can be placed at the known location of the highest gas concentration, and a relatively slow response is acceptable. The open path detector excels in outdoor situations where, even if the likely source of the gas release is known, the evolution of the developing cloud or plume is unpredictable. Gas will almost certainly enter an extended linear beam before finding its way to any single chosen point. Also, point detectors in exposed outdoor locations require weather shields to be fitted, increasing the response time significantly. Open path detectors can also show a cost advantage in any application where a row of point detectors would be required to achieve the same coverage, for instance monitoring along a pipeline, or around the perimeter of a plant. Not only will one detector replace several, but the costs of installation, maintenance, cabling etc. are likely to be lower.

==Component parts==
In principle any source of infrared radiation could be used, together with an optical system of lenses or mirrors to form the transmitted beam. In practice the following sources have been used, always with some form of [[modulation]] to aid the signal processing at the receiver:

An [[incandescent light bulb]], modulated by pulsing the current powering the filament or by a mechanical [[optical chopper|chopper]]. For systems used outdoors, it is difficult for an incandescent source to compete with the intensity of [[sunlight]] when the sun shines directly into the receiver. Also, it is difficult to achieve modulation frequencies distinguishable from those that can be produced naturally, for instance by [[Atmospheric refraction|heat shimmer]] or by sunlight reflecting off waves at sea.

A [[gas-discharge lamp]] is capable of exceeding the [[spectral power distribution|spectral power]] of direct sunlight in the infrared, especially when pulsed. Modern open path systems typically use a xenon [[flashtube]] powered by a [[capacitor]] discharge. Such pulsed sources are inherently modulated.

A [[laser diode|semiconductor laser]] provides a relatively weak source, but one that can be modulated at high frequency in wavelength as well as amplitude. This property permits various signal processing schemes based on [[Fourier analysis]], of use when the absorption of the gas is weak but narrow in [[spectral linewidth]].

The precise [[Band-pass filter|wavelength passbands]] used must be isolated from the broad infrared spectrum. In principle any conventional [[spectrometer]] technique is possible, but the [[Nondispersive infrared sensor|NDIR]] technique with [[Optical coating|multilayer dielectric]] filters and beamsplitters is most often used. These wavelength-defining components are usually located in the receiver, although one design has shared the task with the transmitter.

At the receiver, the infrared signal strengths are measured by some form of [[infrared detector]]. Generally [[photodiode]] detectors are preferred, and are essential for the higher modulation frequencies, whereas slower [[Photoconductivity|photoconductive]] detectors may be required for longer wavelength regions. The signals are fed to [[low-noise amplifier]]s, then invariably subject to some form of [[digital signal processing]]. The [[Attenuation coefficient|absorption coefficient]] of the gas will vary across the passband, so the simple [[Beer–Lambert law]] cannot be applied directly. For this reason the processing usually employs a [[lookup table|calibration table]], applicable for a particular gas, type of gas, or gas mixture, and sometimes configurable by the user.

==Operating wavelengths==
The choice of infrared wavelengths used for the measurement largely defines the detector's suitability for a particular applications. Not only must the target gas (or gases) have a suitable [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] spectrum, the wavelengths must lie within a [[Infrared window|spectral window]] so the air in the beam path is itself transparent. These wavelength regions have been used:

* ''3.4 μm region.'' All [[hydrocarbon]]s and their derivatives absorb strongly, due to the C-H stretch mode of [[molecular vibration]]. It is commonly used in [[Infrared point sensor|infrared point detectors]] where path lengths are necessarily short, and for open-path detectors requiring parts-per-million sensitivity. A disadvantage for many applications is that methane absorbs relatively weakly compared to heavier hydrocarbons, leading to large inconsistencies of calibration. For open-path detection of flammable concentrations the absorption for non-methane hydrocarbons is so strong that the measurement saturates, a significant gas cloud appearing 'black'. This wavelength region is beyond the transmission range of [[borosilicate glass]], so windows and lenses must be made of more expensive materials and tend to be small in [[aperture]].
* ''2.3 μm region.'' All [[hydrocarbon]]s and their derivatives have [[Attenuation coefficient|absorption coefficients]] appropriate for open path detection at flammable concentrations. A useful advantage in practical applications is that the detector's response to many different gases and vapours is relatively uniform when expressed in terms of the [[lower flammable limit]]. [[Borosilicate glass]] retains useful transmission in this wavelength region, allowing large aperture optics to be produced at moderate cost.
* ''1.6 μm region.'' A wide range of gases absorb in the near-infrared. Typically the [[Attenuation coefficient|absorption coefficients]] are relatively weak, but light molecules show narrow, individually [[Spectral resolution|resolved]] spectral lines rather than broad bands. This results in relatively large values of the [[gradient]] and [[curvature]] of the absorption with respect to wavelength, enabling [[laser diode|semiconductor laser-based]] systems to distinguish gas molecules very specifically; for instance [[hydrogen sulfide]], or [[methane]] to the exclusion of heavier hydrocarbons.

==History==
The first open-path detector offered for routine industrial use, as distinct from research instruments built in small numbers, was the Wright and Wright 'Pathwatch' in the US, 1983. Acquired by Det-tronics in 1992, the detector operated in the 3.4 μm region with a powerful incandescent source and a mechanical [[optical chopper|chopper]]. It did not achieved large volume sales, mainly because of cost and doubts about long-term reliability with moving parts. Beginning in 1985, Shell Research in UK was funded by Shell Natural Gas to develop an open-path detector with no moving parts. The advantages of the 2.3 μm wavelength were identified, and a research prototype was demonstrated. This design had a combined transmitter-receiver with a [[Corner reflector|corner-cube]] [[retroreflector]] at 50 m. It used a pulsed incandescent lamp, [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]] photoconductive detectors in the gas and reference channels, and an Intel 8031 microprocessor for signal processing. In 1987 Shell licensed this technology to Sieger-Zellweger (later [[Honeywell Analytics|Honeywell]]) who designed and marketed their industrial version as the 'Searchline', using a retro-reflective panel made up of multiple corner-cubes. This was the first open-path detector to be certified for use in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]] and to have no moving parts. Later work by Shell Research used two alternately pulsed incandescent sources in the transmitter and a single PbS detectors in the receiver, avoiding zero drifts caused by the variable [[responsivity]] of PbS detectors. This technology was offered to Sieger-Zellweger, and later licensed to PLMS. a company part-owned by Shell Ventures UK. The PLMS GD4001/2 in 1991 were the first detectors to achieve a truly stable zero without moving parts or software compensation of slow drifts. They were also the first infrared gas detectors of any kind to be certified [[Intrinsic safety|intrinsically safe]]. The Israeli company Spectronix (also Spectrex) made an important advance in 1996 with their SafEye, the first to use a flash tube source, followed by Sieger-Zellweger with their Searchline Excel in 1998. In 2001 the PLMS Pulsar, soon afterwards acquired by [[Drägerwerk|Dräger]] as their Polytron Pulsar, was the first detector to incorporate sensing to monitor the mutual alignment of the transmitter and receiver during both installation and routine operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10872">In cosmology, '''intensity mapping''' is an observational technique for surveying the [[large-scale structure of the universe]] by using the integrated [[radio waves|radio emission]] from unresolved gas clouds.

In its most common variant, '''21&amp;nbsp;cm intensity mapping''', the [[Hydrogen line|21cm emission line]] of neutral hydrogen is used to trace the gas. The hydrogen follows fluctuations in the underlying cosmic density field, with regions of higher density giving rise to a higher intensity of emission. Intensity fluctuations can therefore be used to reconstruct the [[Matter power spectrum|power spectrum of matter fluctuations]]. The frequency of the emission line is [[redshift]]ed by the expansion of the Universe, so by using radio receivers that cover a wide frequency band, one can detect this signal as a function of redshift, and thus cosmic time. This is similar in principle to a [[Redshift survey|galaxy redshift survey]], with the important distinction that galaxies do not need to be individually detected and measured, making intensity mapping a considerably faster method.&lt;ref name="Bull"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bull|first1=Philip|last2=Ferreira|first2=Pedro G.|last3=Patel|first3=Prina|last4=Santos|first4=Mario G.|title=Late-time cosmology with 21cm intensity mapping experiments|date=2014-05-06|arxiv=1405.1452|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/803/1/21|bibcode=2015ApJ...803...21B|volume=803|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific applications ==

Intensity mapping has been proposed as a way of measuring the cosmic matter density field in several different regimes.

=== Epoch of Reionization ===

Between the times of [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[reionization]], the [[baryon]]ic content of the Universe – mostly hydrogen – existed in a neutral phase. Detecting the 21&amp;nbsp;cm emission from this time, all the way through to the end of reionization, has been proposed as a powerful way of studying early structure formation.&lt;ref name="Loeb"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|last2=Zaldarriaga|first2=Matias|title=Measuring the Small-Scale Power Spectrum of Cosmic Density Fluctuations through 21 cm Tomography Prior to the Epoch of Structure Formation|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=92|issue=21|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.211301|pmid=15245272|date=May 2004|pages=211301|arxiv=astro-ph/0312134|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92u1301L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of the Universe's history corresponds to redshifts of &lt;math&gt;z \approx 30&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z \approx 6 - 12&lt;/math&gt;, implying a frequency range for intensity mapping experiments of 50 – 200&amp;nbsp;MHz.

=== Large-scale structure and dark energy ===

At late times, after the Universe has [[Reionization|reionized]], most of the remaining neutral hydrogen is stored in dense gas clouds called [[damped Lyman-alpha system]]s, where it is protected from [[Extragalactic background light|ionizing UV radiation]]. These are predominantly hosted in galaxies, so the neutral hydrogen signal is effectively a tracer of the galaxy distribution.

As with galaxy redshift surveys, intensity mapping observations can be used to measure the geometry and expansion rate of the Universe (and therefore the properties of [[dark energy]]&lt;ref name="Bull"/&gt;) by using the [[Baryon Acoustic Oscillations|baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature in the matter power spectrum as a [[standard ruler]]. The growth rate of structure, useful for testing [[Alternatives to general relativity|modifications to general relativity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Alex|last2=Bonvin|first2=Camille|last3=Challinor|first3=Anthony|title=Testing general relativity with 21-cm intensity mapping|journal=Physical Review D|date=19 March 2013|volume=87|issue=6|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.87.064026|arxiv=1212.0728|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87f4026H}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be measured using [[Peculiar velocity|redshift space distortions]]. Both of these features are found at large scales of tens to hundreds of [[megaparsec]]s, which is why low angular resolution (unresolved) maps of neutral hydrogen are sufficient to detect them. This should be compared with the resolution of a redshift survey, which must detect individual galaxies that are typically only tens of kiloparsecs across.

Because intensity mapping surveys can be carried out much faster than conventional optical redshift surveys, it is possible to map-out significantly larger volumes of the Universe. As such, intensity mapping has been proposed as a way of measuring phenomena on extremely large scales, including [[Non-Gaussianity|primordial non-Gaussianity]] from [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camera|first1=Stefano|last2=Santos|first2=Mário G.|last3=Ferreira|first3=Pedro G.|last4=Ferramacho|first4=Luís|title=Cosmology on Ultralarge Scales with Intensity Mapping of the Neutral Hydrogen 21 cm Emission: Limits on Primordial Non-Gaussianity|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=111|issue=17|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.171302|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111q1302C|pmid=24206474|page=171302|arxiv=1305.6928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general relativistic corrections to the [[Correlation function (astronomy)|matter correlation function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maartens|first1=Roy|last2=Zhao|first2=Gong-Bo|last3=Bacon|first3=David|last4=Koyama|first4=Kazuya|last5=Raccanelli|first5=Alvise|title=Relativistic corrections and non-Gaussianity in radio continuum surveys|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=26 February 2013|volume=2013|issue=02|pages=044–044|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/02/044|arxiv=1206.0732|bibcode=2013JCAP...02..044M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular and fine structure lines ===

In principle, any emission line can be used to make intensity maps if it can be detected.  Other emission lines that have been proposed as cosmological tracers include:
* Rotational transitions in molecules, such as carbon monoxide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=Adam|last2=Furlanetto|first2=Steven R.|last3=Peng Oh|first3=S.|last4=Aguirre|first4=James|last5=Chang|first5=Tzu-Ching|last6=Doré|first6=Olivier|last7=Pritchard|first7=Jonathan R.|title=INTENSITY MAPPING WITH CARBON MONOXIDE EMISSION LINES AND THE REDSHIFTED 21 cm LINE|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 November 2011|volume=741|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/741/2/70|bibcode=2011ApJ...741...70L|arxiv=1104.4800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System''' provides easy access to key Solar System data and flexible production of highly accurate [[ephemerides]] for Solar System objects.

[[Osculating orbit|Osculating elements]] at a given [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] are always an approximation to an object's orbit (i.e. an unperturbed conic orbit or a "[[Two-body problem|two-body]]" orbit). The real orbit (or the best approximation to such) considers [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] by all planets, a few of the [[List of notable asteroids|larger asteroids]], a few other usually small physical forces, and requires [[numerical integration]].

[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) ephemerides do not use things such as periods, eccentricities, etc.&lt;ref name="jpl-ssd-faq"&gt;{{cite web

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53554">This is a '''list of broadcast station classes''' applicable in much of North America under international agreements between the United States, Canada and Mexico. [[Effective radiated power]] (ERP) and [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT) are listed unless otherwise noted.

All [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station]]s within 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) of the [[Canada–United States border|US-Canada]] or [[US-Mexico border]] must get approval by both the domestic and foreign agency. These agencies are [[Industry Canada]]/[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) in Canada, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the US, and the [[Federal Telecommunications Institute]] (IFT) in Mexico.

===Station class descriptions===
* '''A''' (formerly '''I''') — [[clear-channel station]]s — 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Class A stations are only protected within a 750-mile radius of the transmitter site. 
**The old Class I was divided into three: Class I-A, I-B and I-N. [[NARBA]] distinguished between Class I-A, which were true clear-channel stations that did not share their channel with another Class I station, and Class I-B, in which a station operated with 50&amp;nbsp;kW at night but shared its channel with at least one other I-B station, requiring directional operation. This distinction was superseded by the [[Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2|Rio Agreement]], which instituted the current class system.
**Most former Class I-As are omnidirectional, though some exceptions exist and some formerly operated directional arrays. 
**Most former Class I-Bs are directional at night, although a few are also directional during days. 
**A very few former Class I-As who dropped to Class I-B while retaining their I-A facilities operate omnidirectionally during all hours.
**Former Class I-N stations exist only in Alaska, where they are too remote to interfere with other clear-channel stations. They are only held to Class B efficiency standards (although higher efficiency is acceptable).
**No new Class A stations are licensed in the coterminous United States, although the FCC states it may be possible to license additional Class A stations in Alaska.
* '''B''' (formerly '''II''' and '''III''') — regional stations — 250 W to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Stations on the [[AM expanded band]], 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, are limited to 10&amp;nbsp;kW days and 1&amp;nbsp;kW nights, non-directionally.
**Several expanded band stations operate DA-N or even DA-2 with up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW during all hours, after providing proof that such operations will not cause co- or adjacent-channel interference. 
**If under 250 W at night, the antenna must be efficient enough to radiate more than 140.82 mV/m at 1&amp;nbsp;km.
* '''C''' (formerly '''IV''') — local unlimited-time stations — 250 W to 1&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Class C stations that were licensed at 100 W are [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]]. 
**Rare Class Cs operate with directional arrays, such as [[KYPA]] and [[KHCB (AM)|KHCB]].
* '''D''' (formerly '''II-D''', '''II-S''', '''III-S''') — current and former [[daytimer]]s — Daytime 250 W to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, nighttime under 250 W or off-air. 
**[[Field strength]] is limited to 140 mV/m (millivolts per meter) at 1&amp;nbsp;km. 
**No new class D stations are licensed, with the exception of Class B stations that are downgrading their nighttime operations to Class D (i.e., less than 250 W). The station's daytime operation is then also reclassified as Class D.
**If a Class D station is on the air at night, it is not protected from any co-channel interference.
* '''TIS'''/'''HAR''' — [[travelers' information station]]s / highway advisory radio stations — Up to 10 W transmitter output power. Stations within [[National Park Service|US national parks]] are licensed by [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]] and not the FCC.
* '''Unlicensed broadcasting''' — (see [[low-power broadcasting]]) — 100&amp;nbsp;mW DC input to final amplifier with a 3-meter maximum length radiator, no license needed, may be measured at edge of campus for school stations

'''Notes:'''
* In the Western Hemisphere ([[ITU Region|ITU region 2]]), [[medium wave]] AM broadcasts are on channels spaced 10&amp;nbsp;kHz apart from 530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, with certain classes restricted to subsets of the available frequencies.
* With few exceptions, Class A stations can be found only on the frequencies of 540&amp;nbsp;kHz, 640 to 780&amp;nbsp;kHz, 800 to 900&amp;nbsp;kHz, 940&amp;nbsp;kHz, 990 to 1140&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1160 to 1220&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 1500 to 1580&amp;nbsp;kHz. The exceptions are cited in relevant international treaties.
* While US and Canadian Class A stations are authorized to operate at a maximum of 50,000 watts day and night (and a minimum of 10,000 watts at night, if grandfathered), certain existing Mexican Class A stations, and certain new Cuban Class A stations are authorized to operate at a higher power. Certain Mexican Class A stations are authorized to operate at less than 50,000 watts at night, if grandfathered, but may operate at up to 100,000 watts during the day.
* Class B and D stations can be found on any frequencies from 540&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz except where frequencies have been reserved for Class C stations.
* Class C stations can be found in the lower 48 US states on the frequencies of 1230&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1240&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1340&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1400&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 1490&amp;nbsp;kHz (commonly known as "graveyard" frequencies). Other countries may use other frequencies for their Class C stations.
* American territories in ITU region 3 with AM broadcasting stations ([[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) use the 9&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing customary to the rest of the world. All stations are class B or lower. 
* Canada also defines Class CC ([[Carrier Current]], restricted to the premises) and LP.  (less than 100 watts)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada Broadcasting Database]&lt;/ref&gt;
* TIS stations can be found on any frequency from 530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz in the US, but may only carry non-commercial messages without music. There is a network of TISs on 1710 in New Jersey.
* [[Low-power AM]] stations located on a school campus are allowed to be more powerful, so long as their signal strength does not exceed roughly 14 to 45 µV/m (microvolts per meter) (depending on frequency) at a distance of 30&amp;nbsp;meters (98.4&amp;nbsp;ft) from campus.

====Former system====
AM station classes were previously assigned [[Roman numerals]] from I to IV in the US, with subclasses indicated by a letter suffix. Current class A is equivalent to the old class I; class B is the old classes II and III, with class D being the II-D, II-S, and III-S subclasses; and class C is the old class IV.

The following conversion table compares the old AM station classes with the new AM station classes:

=== AM station classes and clear channels listed by frequency===
{{See also|North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2}}

The following chart lists frequencies on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band, and which classes broadcast on these frequencies; [[List of broadcast station classes|Class A]] and [[List of broadcast station classes|Class B]], 10,000 watt and higher (full-time) stations in North America which broadcast on [[clear-channel station]] frequencies are also shown.

By international agreement, Class A stations must be 10,000 watts and above, with a 50,000 watt maximum for the US and Canada, but no maximum for other governments in the region. Mexico, for example, typically runs 150,000 to 500,000 watts, but some stations are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] at 10,000 to 20,000 watts at night; by treaty, these sub-50,000 watt Mexican stations may operate with a maximum of 100,000 watts during the daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/ccs.htm|title=Clear Channel Stations|author=|date=|website=www.oldradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the AM broadcast band developed before technology suitable for [[directional antenna]]s, there are numerous exceptions, such as the US use of 800 (kHz) and 900 non-directionally in Alaska, limited to 5&amp;nbsp;kW at night; and 1050 and 1220, directionally, in the [[continental US]], and without time limits; each of these being assigned to specific cities (and each of these being Mexican Class I-A clear channels). In return for these limits on US stations, Mexico accepted limits on 830 and 1030 in Mexico City, non-directionally, restricted to 5&amp;nbsp;kW at night (both of these being US Class I-A clear channels).

'''Notes:'''
* Canada protects all radio stations out to a [[signal strength]] of 0.5[[mV/m]] (54dBu), whereas only commercial B stations in the US are. Commercial B1 in the US is 0.7mV/m (57dBu), and all other stations are 1.0mV/m (60dBu). [[Reserved band|Noncommercial-band]] stations (88.1 to 91.9) are not afforded this protection, and are treated as C3 and C2 even when they are B1 or B. C3 and C2 may also be reported internationally as B1 and B, respectively.
* Class C0 is for former C stations, demoted at request of another station which needs the downgrade to accommodate its own facilities.
* In practice, many stations are above the maximum HAAT for a particular class, and correspondingly must downgrade their power to remain below the reference distance. Conversely, they may ''not'' increase power if they are ''below'' maximum HAAT.
* All class D (including L1 and L2 [[LPFM]] and translator) stations are secondary in the US, and can be bumped or forced off-air completely, even if they are not just a repeater and are the only station a licensee has.
* The United States is divided into regions that have different restrictions for FM stations. Zone I (much of the [[US Northeast]] and [[Midwest]]) and I-A (most of [[California]], plus [[Puerto Rico]]) is limited to classes B and B1, while Zone II (everything else) has only the C classes. All areas have the same classes for A and D.
* Power and height restrictions were put in place in 1962. A number of previously existing stations were [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in, such as [[KVYB]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and [[WMC-FM]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Historically, there were local "Class A" frequencies (like AM radio's class C stations) to which only class A stations would be allocated &amp; the other frequencies could not have a class A. According to the 1982 FCC rules &amp; regulations, those frequencies were: 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 &amp; 107.1. Stations on those twenty frequencies were limited to having equivalent signals no greater that 3KW at 300 feet above average terrain.

=== FM zones ===
[[Image:US FM broadcast zones.png|thumb|right|300px|FM broadcast zones in the US]]
The US is divided into three zones for FM broadcasting: I, I-A and II. The zone where a station is located may limit the choices of broadcast class available to a given FM station.

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;I''' in the US includes all of [[Connecticut]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[West Virginia]]. It also includes the areas south of [[latitude]] 43.5°N in [[Michigan]], [[New Hampshire]], New York, and [[Vermont]]; as well as coastal [[Maine]], southeastern [[Wisconsin]], and northern and eastern [[Virginia]].

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;I-A''' includes [[California]] south of 40°N, as well as [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]].

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;II''' includes the remainder of the [[continental US]], plus [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]].

In Zones I and I-A, there are no Class C, C0, or C1 stations.  However, there are a few Class B stations with [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] power limits in excess of 50 KW, such as [[WETA-FM]] (licensed for Washington DC in zone&amp;nbsp;I, at a power of 75&amp;nbsp;kW ERP), [[WNCI-FM]] (licensed for [[Columbus, Ohio]] in zone&amp;nbsp;I, at a power of 175&amp;nbsp;kW ERP) and [[KPFK]] (Los Angeles, in zone&amp;nbsp;I-A, at 110 KW ERP).

== TV ==
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

=== Full-power stations in the US===
* VHF low (2-6): 100&amp;nbsp;kW video analog; 45&amp;nbsp;kW digital (sliding scale varying with height)
* VHF high (7-13): 316&amp;nbsp;kW video analog; 160&amp;nbsp;kW digital (sliding scale varying with height)
* UHF all (14-51): 5 MW video analog; 1 MW digital

'''Notes:'''

All full-power analog television station transmissions in the US were terminated at midnight [[Eastern Daylight Time]] on June 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtvtransition.org/ A New Era in Television Broadcasting] - DTVTransition.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Horizons/2009/0204/congress-delays-dtv-switch|title=Congress delays DTV switch|author=|date=4 February 2009|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many broadcasters replaced their analog signal with their digital [[ATSC]] signal on the same transmission channel at that time.

* All US digital stations received a -DT suffix during the analog-to-digital transition.  At analog shutdown, the FCC assigned to each digital station the call sign its associated analog station had used.  (with a -TV suffix if the analog station had this suffix, without the -TV suffix if the analog station didn't have it).  Stations could optionally choose to keep the -DT suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-09-1253A1.txt] - FCC DA-09-1253&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stations did not keep the -DT suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_sear.htm] Searching for the -DT suffix returns only 91 stations; -TV returns 903, searching for TV stations with no suffix at all returns 1,827.  Searches conducted 29 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For US analog stations, the -TV suffix was required if there was a radio station with the same three- or four-letter callsign.  Stations not required to use the -TV suffix may optionally request it if desired.
* Analog audio power was limited to 22% of video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/47cfr73.1560.htm] - FCC regulation 73.1560(c)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Full-power stations in Canada===
* Class A: UHF, 10&amp;nbsp;kW video/100m [[EHAAT]]
* Class B: UHF, 100&amp;nbsp;kW video/150m [[EHAAT]]
* Class C: UHF, 1000&amp;nbsp;kW video/300m [[EHAAT]] (?)
* Class D: UHF, more than 1000&amp;nbsp;kW/300m [[EHAAT]]
* Class R: VHF, 100&amp;nbsp;kW low-band (channels 2-6), 325&amp;nbsp;kW high-band.  (channels 7-13)
* Class S: VHF, more than 100&amp;nbsp;kW low-band/325&amp;nbsp;kW high-band.

Notes:
* Official definitions of these classes are difficult to locate.  The values above are inferred from the [http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada database].  There is some ambiguity about the difference between Classes C and D.
* Power-level limitations are not firmly enforced in Canada, and [[Industry Canada]] has been known to license stations for power levels much higher than the generally accepted limits.  For example, [[CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] operated on Channel 3 at over 600&amp;nbsp;kW but was not subject to international co-ordination due to its location 500&amp;nbsp;km north of the border.
* In Canada, the callsigns of all private TV stations have the -TV suffix.  Most [[CBC Television]] and [[Télévision de Radio-Canada]] TV callsigns end in the letter T and have no suffix.  A few Radio-Canada stations, purchased by the CBC from private owners, retain the old -TV callsigns.
* Canadian digital stations all receive the -DT suffix.  (this includes CBC and Radio-Canada stations)  The [http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada database] shows -PT suffixes for the channel allotments for permanent post-transition digital operation but when licences are issued for these permanent digital stations, -DT callsigns are used.

=== Low-power TV (US) ===
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}
[[LPTV]] (secondary) (suffix: -LP, or a sequential-numbered callsign in format W##XX with no suffix for analog or with -D suffix for digital, or -LD for low-power digital stations):
* VHF (2-13): 3&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 3&amp;nbsp;kW digital 
* UHF (14-69): 150&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 15&amp;nbsp;kW digital
* Experimental
* Unlicensed: not allowed except for [[medical]] [[telemetry]], and certain [[wireless microphone]]s

The LPTV (low-power television) service was created in 1982 by the FCC to allocate channels for smaller, local stations, and community channels, such as [[public access]] stations.  LPTV stations that meet additional requirements such as children's "[[E/I]]" core programming and [[Emergency Alert System]] broadcasting capabilities can qualify for a [[Class A television service|Class A (-CA)]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/lptv.html|title=Low Power Television (LPTV) Service|author=|date=17 May 2011|website=fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broadcast translator]]s, [[Broadcast translator#Boosters and distributed transmission|boosters]], and other [[LPTV|LPTV stations]] are considered secondary to full-power stations, unless they have upgraded to class A. Class A is still considered LPTV with respect to stations in Canada and Mexico.

==== Class A television (US) ====
{{main|Class A television service}}
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}

'''Class-A''' stations (US) (suffix: -CA or -CD for digital class A):
* VHF (2-13): 3&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 3&amp;nbsp;kW digital
* UHF (14-69): 150&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 15&amp;nbsp;kW digital

The class-A television class is a variant of LPTV created in 2000 by the FCC to allocate and protect some low-power affiliates. Class-A stations are still low-power, but are protected from [[RF interference]] and from having to change channel should a full-service station request that channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01123.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, class-A stations, LPTV stations, and translators are the only stations currently authorized to broadcast both analog and digital signals, unlike full-power stations which must broadcast a digital signal only.

=== Low-power TV (Canada) ===
In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which, a television transmitter is considered broadcasting at low power.  Industry Canada considers that a low power digital television undertaking "shall not normally extend a distance of 20 km in any direction from the antenna site," based on the determined noise-limited bounding contour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title=Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings|author=|date=|website=ic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
All digital television stations in Mexico have '''-TDT''' callsign suffixes. Analog stations, which existed until December 31, 2016, had '''-TV''' callsign suffixes.

The equivalent of low power or translator service in Mexico is the ''equipo complementario de zona de sombra'', which is intended only to fill in gaps between a station's expected and actual service area caused by terrain; a station of this type shares the callsign of another station. In analog, these services often were broadcast on the same or adjacent channels to their parent station, except in certain areas with tight packing of television stations (such as central Mexico). In digital, these services usually operate on the same RF channel as their parent station, except for those with conflicting full-power applications ([[XHBS-TDT]] Cd. Obregón, Son., channel 30 instead of 25), in certain other cases where it is technically not feasible ([[XHAW-TDT]] Guadalupe, NL, channel 26 instead of 25) or to make way for eventual repacking on upper UHF ([[XHPNW-TDT]] has four shadows on 33, its post-repacking channel, instead of 39).

''Equipos complementarios'' can relay their parent station, or a station that carries 75% or more of the same programming as its parent station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/2016-12-30dof-diariooficialdelafederacion.pdf IFT: Disposición Técnica IFT-013-2016 "Especificaciones y requerimientos mínimos para la instalación y operación de estaciones de televisión, equipos auxiliares y equipos complementarios"], which became effective on January 1, 2017, provides the guidelines for the operation of digital television stations and their shadows.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stations of either type may have unusually low or high effective radiated powers. [[XHSMI-TDT]] in Oaxaca is licensed for two watts in digital. The highest-powered shadows are [[XEQ-TDT]] Toluca and [[XHBS-TDT]] Ciudad Obregón, both at 200&amp;nbsp;kW.

=== FCC service table ===
The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] lists the following services on their website for television broadcasting:

{| class="wikitable"

FCC placeholder for possible future construction permits or frequencies allocated to non-US broadcast use. No call sign, identifier is a date (yymmdd) followed by a sequential two-letter value in the US FCC database.
|-
| Full-service TV (analog)

| '''-TV''' or '''none''' (such as "[[WABC-TV]]" and "[[WMYD]]") Since the shutdown of all full power analog stations in June 2009, used only for historical records.
|-
| Class A (analog)
| CA
| '''-CA''', or a translator-style call sign (such as "[[KTFB-CA]]")
|-
| Low-power station (analog) or translator
| LP
| '''-LP''', or a translator-style call sign (such as "[[KDMD-LP]]", "[[WRME-LP]]", and "[[K13IO]]" with the 2 digits denoting the channel of operation)
|-
| TV [[Broadcast translator#Boosters and distributed transmission|boosters]]
| TB
| Rare. These use the parent station's call sign plus a sequential number, such as [[WSTE|WSTE1]], [[WSTE|WSTE2]], [[WSTE|WSTE3]]. Nameplates for on-channel [[repeater]]s bear the parent station's call sign, followed by "booster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12|title=US CFR 47 Part 74G - 74.733 UHF translator signal boosters.|author=|date=|website=gpoaccess.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[distributed transmission]].  If the station is digital, and has on-channel boosters, they would typically be named [[WSTE|WSTE-DT1]], [[WSTE|WSTE-DT2]], [[WSTE|WSTE-DT3]] and so on.
|-
| TV auxiliary (analog backup) service
| TS
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter)
|-
| NTSC (analog) petition for a channel change
| NN
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as the station which made a request for a number/channel change (for NTSC/analog stations, and low-power repeaters, such as those registered as TX).
|-
| Digital Television&lt;br&gt;(full power)
| DT
| '''-DT''', '''-TV''' or '''none''' (such as [[KGLA-DT]], [[WSKY-TV]] or [[KOHD]]). Some stations formerly used '''-HD''', but this has become obsolete (though it may sometimes still be seen identifying the station's main subchannel in a [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] listing). The -DT suffix, optional for digital-only stations, was used primarily to distinguish a DTV transmission from an analog signal of the same broadcast (or is seen identifying the main subchannel of a station on a PSIP display); likewise, -TV is optional except if the eponymous radio stations exist. A similar suffix '''-DTV''', is used on all television stations in [[Japan]].
|-
| Digital Class-A
| CD
| '''-CD'''(such as "[[WDNI-CD]]" and "[[WYYW-CD]]") Some stations briefly used '''-DC''' as well (this has since become obsolete). A scant few still use translator-style call signs with the '''-D''' suffix (such as "[[KBMT-LD|K36ID-D]]").
|-
| Digital Low-power
| LD
| '''-LD''' or translator-style calls with '''-D''' suffix (such as "[[WBND-LD]]" and "[[W25AA-D]]"), occasionally no suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter). Some stations briefly used '''-DL''' as well (this has since become obsolete).  Some full-powered stations (such as [[WOIO]], [[WXMI]] and [[WLS-TV]]) have been granted approval for fill-in translators within their broadcast market to better cover outlying towns or heavily urbanied areas, particularly by stations with a VHF digital signal.  These are technically -LD stations, but have the same call-sign as their parent station (such as WLS-TV or WOIO, and ''not'' as WLS-LD or WOIO-LD, though they could be considered as such for ease of differentiating the low-power repeater from its parent), similar to a Distributed Transmission System (but on different frequencies).
|-
| Digital [[special temporary authority]] (STA)
| DS
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as station making a request for permission from the FCC to use a channel, power level or transmitter location not permanently allocated for one particular station. Temporary assignments retain, unmodified, the call sign of the corresponding permanent allocation; this includes translator-style calls (a format, such as W[[Channel 55 (disambiguation)|55]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ZZ&lt;/nowiki&gt;-D, based on RF channel number plus a sequential identifier) even on those temporarily moving to another frequency.

|-
|  Digital Television [[distributed transmission system]] (multiple transmitter sites) 
| DD
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter); this is usually requested for a [[single-frequency network]] and to tailor coverage area to the needs of the viewers in the station's service area (such as covering towns and farmland, and not mountainous terrain or the ocean)
|-
| Digital auxiliary (backup) service
| DX&lt;br&gt;(not to be confused with [[DXing]])
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter)
|-
| Digital [[rulemaking]] petition
| DR
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as station making this request to add or modify a digital channel allocation
|-
| Land mobile use of a TV channel (TV RF channels 14-20 only)
| LM
| As "LM" is used in the FCC database to indicate reallocation of an entire channel, but not to identify individual users transmitting in that spectrum, a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz LM allocation does not itself carry a TV-style call sign. The spectrum of TV channels 14-20 is called "T-band" in LMR use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?state=&amp;call=&amp;arn=&amp;city=&amp;chan=&amp;cha2=69&amp;serv=LM&amp;type=0&amp;facid=&amp;list=1&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;size=9|title=TV Query Results -- Video Division (FCC) USA|author=|date=|website=www.fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters that operate in such an allocation use a 3&amp;nbsp;MHz offset instead of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz as normally used in the 450-470&amp;nbsp;MHz range.
|-
| [[ATSC#ATSC 3.0|ATSC 3.0 Futurecast]] Experimental Broadcasts
| EX
| Used for officially licensed experimental [[4K resolution|4K]]/[[2160p]] [[Ultra HDTV]] broadcast stations, such as [[WRAL-TV]]'s UHDTV simulcast, WRAL-EX.

[[Bruce Bagemihl]] writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not officially observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people making homosexuality in animals a [[taboo]] subject.&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality,'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) "explanations" for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities.&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only"&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s". Homosexual behavior is  found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily sexual activity, has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality in animals is controversial with some [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of homosexuality in humans, while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, social liberals and many gay people believe homosexuality is natural, and therefore find the existence of homosexual sex in animals unsurprising.  Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]], [[genitals|genital]] stimulation, [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

This a list of some [[mammals]] that had been recorded engaging in homosexual behavior, which is part of a larger [[list of animals displaying homosexual behavior]] including [[birds]], [[insects]], [[fish]] etc.

In [[computing]], '''Machine Check Architecture''' ('''MCA''') is an [[Intel]] mechanism in which the [[CPU]] reports hardware errors to the [[operating system]].

[[Intel]]'s Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, P6 family processors as well as the Itanium architecture implement a machine check architecture that provides a mechanism for detecting and reporting hardware (machine) errors, such as: system bus errors, [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|ECC]] errors, parity errors, [[CPU cache|cache]] errors, and [[translation lookaside buffer]] errors. It consists of a set of model-specific registers ([[Model-specific register|MSR]]s) that are used to set up machine checking and additional banks of MSRs used for recording errors that are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Modern architecture''', or '''modernist architecture''' was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction, particularly the use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[reinforced concrete]];  the idea that form should follow function; an embrace of [[minimalism]]; and a rejection of ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/modernism|title=What is Modern architecture?|language=English|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after [[World War II]] until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the  
principal style for institutional and corporate buildings  by [[Postmodern architecture]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=6-10}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering and building materials,  and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and to invent something that was purely functional and new.

The revolution in materials came first, with the use of [[cast iron]], [[plate glass]], and [[reinforced concrete]], to build structures that were stronger, lighter and taller.  The [[cast plate glass]] process was invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. [[The Crystal Palace]] by [[Joseph Paxton]] at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story [[Home Insurance Building]] in [[Chicago]], built in 1884 by [[William Le Baron Jenney]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=42-43}}  The iron frame construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]], then the tallest structure in the world, captured the imagination of millions of visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Universal Exposition]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=14-16}}

French industrialist [[François Coignet]] was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete strengthened with iron bars,  as a technique for constructing buildings.&lt;ref name="britannia"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124672/Francois-Coignet Encyclopædia Britannica - François Coignet]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-story house in the suburbs of Paris.&lt;ref name="britannia"/&gt; A further important step forward was the invention of the safety [[elevator]] by [[Elisha Otis]], first demonstrated at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1852, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=42}}    Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=16}}

The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century,  most notably [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticism]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture]], and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000. "Modernism in Art Design and Architecture", New York: St. Martins Press.{{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;  This break with the past was particularly urged by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].  In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur L'Architecture'',  he urged: "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material;  for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet Le-duc, ''Entretiens sur Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, a few architects began to challenge the traditional [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States.  The [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1896-99) designed by [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]], had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=27}} The [[Art Nouveau]] style was launched in the 1890s by [[Victor Horta]] in Belgium and [[Hector Guimard]] in France; it introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms.  In Barcelona, [[Antonio Gaudi]] conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; the facade of the [[Casa Battlo]] in [[Barcelona]] (1904–1907) had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=33}}

Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques, which gave them greater freedom to create new forms. In 1903–1904 in Paris [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] began to use [[reinforced concrete]], previously only used for industrial structures, to build apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Poisson|pages=318-319}}  Reinforced concrete, which could be molded into any shape, and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars, replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects. The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles, but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris; here the concrete was left bare, and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows. [[Henri Sauvage]] added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris (1912–1914); the reinforced concrete building was in steps, with each floor set back from the floor below, creating a series of terraces.  Between 1910 and 1913, Auguste Perret built the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction, with Art Deco sculptural bas-reliefs on the facade by [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. Because of the concrete construction, no columns blocked the spectator's view of the stage.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|page=318}}

[[Otto Wagner]], in Vienna, was another pioneer of the new style. In his book ''Moderne Architektur'' (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on "modern life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0226869393 Otto Wagner, ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to this Field of Art''], 1895, translation by Harry Francis Mallgrave, Getty Publications, 1988, {{ISBN|0226869393}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at [[Karlsplatz]] in Vienna (1888–89), then an ornamental [[Art Nouveau]] residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the [[Austrian Postal Savings Bank]] (1904–1906).  Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior.  The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare,  a large open space of steel, glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself.{{Sfn|Bony|page=36}}

The Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]] also began removing any ornament from his buildings.  His [[Steiner House]], in Vienna (1910), was an example of what he called [[rationalist architecture]]; it had a simple stucco rectangular facade with square windows and no ornament. . The fame of the new movement, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]] spread beyond Austria. [[Josef Hoffmann]], a student of Wagner, constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture, the [[Palais Stoclet]], in Brussels, in 1906–1911. This residence, built of brick covered with Norwegian marble, was composed of geometric blocks, wings and a tower.  A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms. The interior was decorated with paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]] and other artists, and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=38}}

In Germany, a modernist industrial movement, [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) had been created in Munich in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]], a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists,  to turn out well-designed, high quality products, and in the process to invent a new type of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Burckhardt (1987) .

ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include [[Peter Behrens]], [[Theodor Fischer]] (who served as its first president), [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Richard Riemerschmid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. "Joseph August Lux: Werkbund Promoter, Historian of a Lost Modernity," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' 63/1 (June 2004): 202&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911–1913, [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, a building without ornament where every construction element was on display. The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  For the 1914 Cologne exhibition, [[Bruno Taut]] built a revolutionary glass pavilion.{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=19}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a highly original and independent American architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement.  Like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], he had no formal architectural training. In 1887-93 he worked in the Chicago office of [[Louis Sullivan]], who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in Chicago, and who famously stated "form follows function." {{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=16}}  Wright set out to break all the traditional rules. Wright was particularly famous for his [[Prairie Houses]],  including the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]](1893–94),;[[Arthur Heurtley House]] (1902) and [[Robie House]] (1909); sprawling, geometric residences without decoration, with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth, and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the American prairie.  His [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Building]] (1904–1906) in [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Unity Temple]] (1905) in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] and [[Unity Temple]] had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=62-63}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, the first [[skyscrapers]] began to appear in the United States.  They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety [[elevator]] invented by [[Elisha Otis]] in 1852. The first steel-framed "skyscraper", The [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]] in 1883, and was briefly the tallest building in the world. [[Louis Sullivan]] built another monumental new structure, the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]], in the heart of Chicago in 1904-06. While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from neo-renaissance, [[Neo-Gothic]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  The [[Woolworth Building]], designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the [[Chrysler Building]] in 1929.  The structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with [[Neo-Gothic]] ornament, complete with decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it be nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce."   {{Sfn|Burchard and Brown|1966|page=83}}

==Rise of Modernism in Europe and Russia (1918–1931)==
After the first World War, a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of [[neo-classicism]] and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, and the modernists, led by [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in France, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] in Germany, and [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the new [[Soviet Union]], who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration. [[Art Deco]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] often made a compromise between the two, combining modernist forms and stylized decoration.

The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, a Swiss-French architect who in 1920 took the name [[Le Corbusier]].  In 1920 he co-founded a journal called '''L'Espirit Nouveau'' and energetically promoted architecture that was functional, pure, and free of any decoration or historical associations.  He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism, based on planned cities.  In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people, whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland. He designed modular houses, which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks, neighborhoods and cities. In 1923 he published "Toward an Architecture", with his famous slogan, "a house is a machine for living in."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture", (1923), Flammarion edition (1995), pages XVIII-XIX&lt;/ref&gt;  He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans, articles, books, conferences, and participation in Expositions.

To illustrate his ideas, in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris.  They were all built according to a common system,  based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans, independent of the structure.  They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the [[Villa Savoye]], built in 1928–1931 in the Paris suburb of [[Poissy]].  An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Germany, two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War,   The [[Bauhaus]] was a school organized [[Weimar]] in 1919 under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]].  Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin, who studied before the war with [[Peter Behrens]], and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory.  The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology.  In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau;  Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new, purely functional modernist style he was encouraging.  The school brought together modernists in all fields;  the faculty included the modernist painters [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Josef Albers|Joseph Albers]] and [[Paul Klee]], and the designer [[Marcel Breuer]].

Gropius became an important theorist of modernism, writing ‘’The Idea and Construction’’ in 1923.  He was an advocate of standardization in architecture, and the mass construction of rationally-designed apartment blocks for factory workers.  In 1928 he was commissioned by the [[Siemens]] company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin,  and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers.

While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin.  Inspired by the [[De Stijl]] movement in the Netherlands, he built clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower.  He became the vice president of the German ‘’Werkbund’’, and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1932.  proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction.  His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona. It was a work of pure modernism, with glass and concrete walls and clean, horizontal lines.  Though it was only a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930, it became, along with Le Corbusier's [[Villa Savoye]], one of best-known landmarks of modernist architecture.  A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists, and closed the school in 1932.  Gropius left Germany and went to England, then to the United States, where he and [[Marcel Breuer]] both joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects. In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United States; he became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Expressionism]], which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925, was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund.  Its advocates, including [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Fritz Hoger]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]], wanted to create architecture that was poetic, expressive, and optimistic. Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid–1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;   As result, many of the most innovative expressionist projects, including [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels'', remained on paper. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. A particular type, using bricks to create its forms (rather than concrete) is known as [[Brick Expressionism]].

[[Erich Mendelsohn]],  (who disliked the term Expressionism for his work) began his career designing churches, silos, and factories which were highly imaginative, but, for lack of resources, were never built In 1920, he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam;  an observatory and research center called the [[Einsteinium]], named in tribute to [[Albert Einstein]].  It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete, but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster. His sculptural form, very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus, first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Berlin. His [[Mossehaus]] in Berlin was an early model for the [[streamline moderne]] style.  His [[Columbushaus]] on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin (1931) was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed. (It was torn down in 1957, because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin, where the [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed.)  Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he moved to England (1933), then to the United States (1941).{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=95}}

[[Fritz Höger]] was another notable Expressionist architect of the period.  His [[Chilehaus]] was built as the headquarters of a shipping company, and was modeled after a giant steamship, a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow. It was constructed of dark brick, and used external piers to express its vertical structure. Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals, as did its internal arcades. [[Hans Poelzig]] was another notable expressionist architect.  In 1919 he built the ''[[Großes Schauspielhaus]]'', an immense theater in Berlin, seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario [[Max Reinhardt]].  It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome, and lights on massive columns in its foyer. He also constructed the [[IG Farben building]], a massive corporate headquarters, now the main building of [[Goethe University]] in Frankfurt. [[Bruno Taut]] specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for working-class Berliners.  He built twelve thousand individual units, sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes, such as a giant horseshoe.  Unlike most other modernists, he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name, [[Brick Expressionism]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=26-27}}

The Austrian philosopher, architect and social critic [[Rudolf Steiner]] also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms. His [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], built from 1926 near [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] the [[Einsteinturm]] in Potsdam, Germany, and the [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1926), were based on no traditional models, and had entirely original shapes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the [[Russian Revolution]]  of 1917, Russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism.  The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period, the [[futurism]] of poet [[Vladimir Mayakovskiy]], the [[Suprematism]] of painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], and the colorful [[Rayonism]] of painter [[Mikhail Larionov]]. The most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor [[Vladimir Tatlin]] for the Moscow meeting of the Third [[Communist International]] in 1920:  he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high, with four geometric volumes suspended from cables.  The movement of Russian [[Constructivist architecture]] was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by [[Aleksandr Rodchenko]].  Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the "communist expression of material structures." Soviet architects began to construct workers' clubs, communal apartment houses, and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=86-87}}

One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was [[Konstantin Melnikov]], the number of working clubs - including [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1928) - and his own living house, [[Melnikov House]] (1929) near [[Arbat Street]] in [[Moscow]].  Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris in 1925;  it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway, and crowned with a hammer and sickle.  The leading group of constructivist architects, led by [[Vesnin brothers]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], was publishing the 'Contemporary Architecture' journal. This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan - including colossal [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1932) - and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburg's [[Narkomfin building]]. A number of architects from the pre-Soviet period also took up the constructivist style.  The most famous example was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow (1924), by [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alexey Shchusev (1873-1949)|url = http://www.architectural-review.com/view/reviews/reputations/alexey-shchusev-1873-1949/8660736.article|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad; however, during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities. The regional industrial centers, including [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinburg]], [[Kharkiv]] or [[Ivanovo]], were rebuilt in the constructivist manner; some cities, like [[Magnitogorsk]] or [[Zaporizhia]], were constructed anew (the so-called ''socgorod'', or 'socialist city').

The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s, replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored. Constructivist architects and even [[Le Corbusier]] projects for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] from 1931 to 1933, but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed [[Postconstructivism]].  The last major Russian constructivist building, by [[Boris Iofan]], was built for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Exhibition]] (1937), where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitler's architect [[Albert Speer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facing Hitler's Pavilion: The Uses of Modernity in the Soviet Pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition|url = http://jch.sagepub.com/content/47/1/13|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0022-0094|pages = 13–47|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022009411422369|first = Danilo|last = Udovički-Selb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism becomes a movement: CIAM (1928)===
{{main article|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne}}
By the late 1920s, modernism had become an important movement in Europe.  Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international.  The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]], had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]] in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]].  Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland June 26–28, 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Lluís Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland.  No one attended from the United States.  A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city",  was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84-85}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Art Deco]] architectural style (called ''Style Moderne'' in [[France]]),  was modern, but it was not modernist;  it had many features of modernism,  including the use of reinforced concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[Neo-classicism]];  but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color.  It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe;  in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia and Japan.  In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries.  Only two pavilions were purely modernist;  the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in a flamboyantly [[futurist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Anwas, Victor, ''Art Deco'' (1992), Harry N. Abrams Inc., {{ISBN|0810919265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the [[Grand Rex]] movie theater in Paris, [[La Samaritaine]] department store by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1926–28) and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris (1937–38) by [[Auguste Perret]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] and [[Palais de Chaillot]], both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Poisson, Michel, ''1000 Immeubles et Monuments de Paris'' (2009), Parigramme, pages 318-319 and 300-01&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the [[Chrysler Building]], [[Empire State Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, and [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit.  The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at the top of the Chrysler building, Art Deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce", were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns,  and European cathedrals, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] himself experimented with [[Mayan Revival architecture|Mayan Revival]], in the concrete cube-based [[Ennis House]] of 1924 in Los Angeles. The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities.  The style was used most often in office buildings, but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced.{{Sfn|Duncan}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The beginning of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 brought an end to lavishly-decorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers. It also brought in a new style, called "Streamline Moderne" or sometimes just Streamline.  This style, sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners, featured rounded corners,  strong horizontal lines, and often nautical features, such as superstructures and steel railings. It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation;  the style was often used for new airport terminals, train and bus stations, and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system.  In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings, but in railroad locomotives, and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.  It both borrowed from [[industrial design]] and influenced it.&lt;!--Raymond Loewy; locomotives, aircraft, and ships, automobiles--&gt;&lt;!--cosmetic functionality--&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|2014|page=204}}

In the United States, the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings, sometimes called [[PWA Moderne]], for the [[Public Works Administration]], which launched gigantic construction programs in the U.S. to stimulate employment.  It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament, and was employed in state and federal buildings, from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] (1941–43), begun just before the United States entered the Second World War.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|accessdate=March 2011|page=27|origyear=2003|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Frank Lloyd Wright|Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Richard Neutra}}
During the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements. He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own. Between 1916 and 1922, he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement; this became known as his "Mayan style", after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization. He experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing. He identified his architecture as "Usonian", a combination of USA, "utopian" and "organic social order". His business was severely affected by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929; he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment.  Between 1928 and 1935, he built only two buildings: a hotel near [[Chandler, Arizona]], and the most famous of all his residences, [[Fallingwater]] (1934–37), a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J. Kaufman. Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall, perfectly uniting architecture and nature.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=99}}

The Austrian architect [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]] designed what could be called the first house in the modern style in 1922, the Schindler house. 
Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell beach house in [[Newport Beach]]. The Austrian architect [[Richard Neutra]] moved to the United States in 1923, worked for short time with Frank Lloyd Wright, also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client, the [[Lovell House]] in [[Los Angeles]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]] in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco, and of pre-war architectural styles.  Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style, with colonnades and sculptural decoration.  The pavilions of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika, faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union, topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle.  As to the modernists, Le Corbusier was practically, but not quite invisible at the Exposition; he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux, but focused mainly on his painting.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=216}} The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier, [[Josep Lluis Sert]], the Spanish-Catalan architect, whose pavilion of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was pure modernist glass and steel box. Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition, the painting ''[[Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The original building was destroyed after the Exposition, but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona.

The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the [[Fascist architecture]] of Italy, and [[Nazi architecture]] of Germany, based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeur. The Nazi architecture, much of it designed by [[Albert Speer]], was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale.  Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe, more grand than Rome or Paris.  The Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States.  In Italy, Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=Frampton1&gt;{{cite book|last=Frampton|first=Kenneth|title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History|year=1980 |publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-20257-5|pages=210–218|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis;  the spirit of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Italian Rationalism]] of the 1920s continued, with the work of architect [[Giuseppe Terragni]] His ''Casa dl Fascio'' in Como, headquarters of the local Fascist party, was a perfectly modernist building,  with geometric proportions (33.2 meters long by 16.6 meters high);  a clean facade of marble, and a Renaissance-inspired interior courtyard.  Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini, a proponent of monumental fascist architecture, who rebuilt the University of Rome, and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[1939 New York World's Fair]] marked a turning point in architecture between the Art Deco and modern architecture.  The theme of the Fair was the ''World of Tomorrow'', and its symbols were the purely geometric trilon and perisphere sculpture. It had many monuments to Art Deco, such as the Ford Pavilion in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style, but also included the new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War. The Pavilions of Finland,  by [[Alvar Aalto]], of Sweden by [[Sven Markelius]], and of Brazil by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Lucio Costa]], looked forward to a new style.  They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[World War II]] (1939–1945) and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology, and in turn, architectural possibilities.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII /&gt;&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-032573-1 |pages= 41–42, 48–49 |editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials, leading to the adoption of new materials, such as aluminum, The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of [[prefabricated building]]; largely for the military and government. The semi-circular metal [[Nissen hut]] of World War I was revived as the [[Quonset hut]].  The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses, including the enameled-steel [[Lustron house]] (1947–1950), and Buckminster Fuller's experimental aluminum [[Dymaxion House]].&lt;ref name=Materials /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials |year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-032573-1|page=259|editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture.  Large parts of major cities, from Berlin, Tokyo and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London; all the port cities of France, particularly [[Le Havre]], Brest,  Marseille, Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing.  In the United States, little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s;  housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war.  The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous government-financed housing projects, usually in run-down center of American cities, and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities, where land was available,

One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre, destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944;  133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened, destroying 12,500 buildings and leaving 40,000 persons homeless. The architect [[Auguste Perret]], a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials, designed and built an entirely new center to the city, with apartment blocks, cultural, commercial and government buildings. He restored historic monuments when possible, and built a new church, St. Joseph,  with a lighthouse-like tower in the center to inspire hope.  His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=140-41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Shortly after the War, the French architect [[Le Corbusier]], who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years, was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in [[Marseille]].  He called it [[Unité d'Habitation]] in Marseille, but it more popularly took the name of the [[Cité Radieuse]], after his book about futuristic urban planning.  Following his doctrines of design, the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons.  it contained 337 duplex apartment units, fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle. Each unit had two levels and a small terrace.  Interior "streets"  had shops, a nursery school and other serves, and the flat terrace roof had a running track, ventilation ducts,  and a small theater.  Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional;  the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. Unité d'Habitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities, both in France and Germany.  Combined with his equally radical organic design for the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapel of Notre-Dame du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]], this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=152-163}}

==Postwar modernism in the United States (1945–1985)==
{{main article|International Style (architecture)}}
The [[International Style (architecture)|international Style]] of architecture had appeared in Europe, particularly in the [[Bauhaus]] movement,  in the late 1920s.  In 1932 it was recognized and given a name at an Exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City organized by architect [[Philip Johnson]] and architectural critic [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]],  Between 1937 and 1941, following the rise Hitler and the Nazis in Germany, most of the leaders of the German [[Bauhaus]] movement found a new home in the United States, and played an important part in the development of American modern architecture.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was eighty years old in 1947;  he had been present at the beginning of American modernism, and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement, continued to play a leading role almost to its end. One of his most original late projects was the campus of [[Florida Southern College]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]], begun in 1941 and completed in 1943.  He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as "The [[Child of the Sun]]". He wrote that he wanted the campus to "grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun."

He completed several notable projects in the 1940s, including the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] and the [[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville]], Oklahoma (1956). The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts;  the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core, like the branches of a tree. Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City.  That project was cancelled because of the [[Great Depression]], and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma.  He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings, but that in Oklahoma it stood alone.  The design is asymmetrical;  each side is different.

In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] to design a museum for his collection of modern art. His design was entirely original;  a bowl-shaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century.  Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959, the year that he died.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Walter Gropius]], the founder of the [[Bauhaus]], moved to England in 1934 and spent three years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]];  Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty. [[Marcel Breuer]], who had worked with him at the Bauhaus, joined him and opened an office in Cambridge.  The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students, who themselves became famous architects, including [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Philip Johnson]].  They did not receive an important commission until 1941, when they designed housing for workers in Kensington, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.,  In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC ([[The Architects Collaborative]]).  Their notable works included the building of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956–57), and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York (1958–63).  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] described his architecture with the famous saying, "Less is more". As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] from 1939 to 1956, Mies (as he was commonly known) made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years.  He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style, two high-rise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive (1948–51), which became models for high-rises across the country.  Other major works included [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]] (1945–1951), a simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture.  The Chicago Convention Center (1952–54) and [[Crown Hall]] at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1950–56), and The [[Seagram Building]] in New York City (1954–58) also set a new standard for purity and elegance.  Based on granite pillars, the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronze-toned I-beams in the structure. He returned to Germany in 1962-68 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin.  His students and followers included [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Eero Saarinen]], whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=129}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Charles and Ray Eames]].  The most celebrated work of the Eames was [[Eames House]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California,  (1949) Charles Eames in collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]]  It is composed of two structures, an architects residence and his studio,  joined in the form of an L. The house, influenced by Japanese architecture, is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes, often using natural materials, supported on a steel framework.  The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen.  He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=135}}

[[Richard Neutra]] continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles, using the theme of the simple box. Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235921/http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutra's [[Constance Perkins House]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (1962) was re-examination of the modest single-family dwelling.  It was built of inexpensive material–wood, plaster, and glass–and completed at a cost of just under $18,000. Neutra scaled the house to the physical dimensions of its owner, a small woman. It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house. One of Neutra's most unusual buildings was [[Shepherd's Grove]] in [[Garden Grove, California]], which featured an adjoining parking lot where worshippers could follow the service without leaving their cars.

Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural mega-agencies, which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects. The firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] was founded in Chicago in 1936 by [[Louis Skidmore]] and [[Nathaniel Owings]], and joined in 1939 by engineer [[John O. Merrill|John Merrill]],  It soon went under the name of SOM.  Its first big project was [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons. In 1964 the firm had eighteen "partner-owners", 54 "associate participants,"and 750 architects, technicians, designers, decorators, and landscape architects.  Their style was largely inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline, including the [[Lever House]] (1951-52) and the [[Manufacturers Trust Company Building]] (1954).  Later buildings by the firm include [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University]] (1963),  the [[Willis Tower]], formerly Sears Tower in Chicago (1973) and [[One World Trade Center]] in New York City  (2013), which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132-33}}

[[Wallace Harrison]] played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York;  as the architectural advisor of the [[Rockefeller Family]], he helped design [[Rockefeller Center]], the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s. He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York World's Fair, and, with his partner [[Max Abramowitz]], was the builder and chief architect of the [[United Nations Building]];  Harrison headed a committee of international architects, which included [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (who produced the original plan approved by the committee) and [[Le Corbusier]],    Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], the master plan for [[Lincoln Center]], and [[John F. Kennedy Airport]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005) was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture.  He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius, then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1946 to 1954. In 1947, he published a book about Mies van der Rohe, and in 1953 designed his own residence, the [[Glass House]] in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in a style modeled after Mies's [[Farnsworth House]]. Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction, moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture.  His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the AT&amp;T Building (later known as the Sony Tower, and now the [[550 Madison Avenue]] in New York City, (1979) an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of curved cap at the top of a piece of [[chippendale furniture]].  This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of [[Postmodern architecture]] in the United States.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

===Eero Saarinen===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Eero Saarinen]] (1910–1961) was the son of [[Eliel Saarinen]], the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University.  His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds.  In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan (1949–55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957–61).  His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the [[Ingalls Rink]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut (1956–59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables,  which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work,  the [[TWA Terminal]]  at JFK airport in New York (1956–1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey.  The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight.  Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure.  One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building,  including the benches, counters,  escalators and clocks, were designed in the same style.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=171-72}}

===Louis Kahn===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Louis Kahn]] (1901–74) was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed from a wide variety of styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947–57, where his students included [[Eero Saarinen]].  From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  His work and ideas influenced [[Philip Johnson]], [[Minoru Yamasaki]], and [[Edward Durell Stone]]  as they moved toward a more neoclassical style.  Unlike Mies, he did not try to make his buildings look light;  he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid.  He drew from a wide variety of different sources;  the towers of [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], New York (1962);  and the [[Kimball Art Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas (1966–72).  Following the example of [[Le Corbusier]] and his design of the government buildings in [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] &amp; [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] State of India, Kahn designed the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] (National Assembly Building) in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (1962–74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn's last work.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=149}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[I. M. Pei]] (born 1917) is a major figure in late modernism and the debut of [[Post-modern architecture]]. He was born in China and educated in the United States, studying architecture at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. While the architecture school there still trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, Pei discovered the writings of [[Le Corbusier]], and a two-day visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Pei's ideas of architecture. In the late 1930s he moved to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied with [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] and became deeply involved in Modernism.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=36}}  After the War he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], before breaking away and starting his own firm. One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the clean modernist facade was admired, the building developed an unexpected problem; it created a wind-tunnel effect, and in strong winds the doors could not be opened. Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds.

Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]], in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism;  it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=59}}

In the late modernist area, art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects;  they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility.  Pei established himself with his design for the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] (1973), which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space, and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it.  This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period, the new East Wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, completed in 1978,  and to another of Pei's most famous projects, the pyramid at the entrance of [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris (1983–89). Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre., as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel, supporting 675 panels of glass, each 2.9 by 1.9 meters.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=210}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In France, [[Le Corbusier]] remained the most prominent architect, though he built few buildings there.  His most prominent late work was the convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in Evreaux-sur-l'Arbresle.  The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament,  inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy.  {{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=164-165}}

In Britain, the major figures in modernism included [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (1926–1992) and [[Denys Lasdun]] (1914–2001).  Lasdun's best-known work is the [[Royal National Theatre]] (1967–1976) on the south bank of the Thames.  Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists; [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] Prince Charles compared it with a nuclear power station.

In Belgium, a major figure was Charles Vandenhove (born 1927)  who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in [[Liege]].  His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles, such as Palladian architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=162}}

In Finland, the most influential architect was [[Alvar Aalto]], who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape, light, and materials, particularly the use of wood. After World War II, he taught architecture in the United States. In Sweden, [[Arne Jacobsen]] was the best-known of the modernists, who designed furniture as well as carefully-proportioned buildings.

In Italy, the most prominent modernist was [[Gio Ponti]], who worked often with the structural engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], a specialist in reinforced concrete.  Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length, twenty-five meters, which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights.  Their best-known design was the [[Pirelli Building]] in [[Milan]] (1958–1960), which for decades was the tallest building in Italy.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=164-165}}

The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect [[Josep Lluis Sert]], who worked with great success in Spain, France and the United States. In his early career he worked for a time under Le Corbusier, and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition. His notable later work included the [[Fondation Maeght]] in Saint-Paul-de-Provence, France (1964), and the [[Harvard Science Center]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as Dean of Architecture at the [[Harvard School of Design]].

Notable German modernists included [[Johannes Krahn]], who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II, and built several important museums and churches, notably [[St. Martin, Idstein]], which artfully combined stone masonry, concrete and glass.  Leading Austrian architects of the style included [[Gustav Peichl]], whose later works included the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic]] in Bonn, Germany (1989).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Brazil]] became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of [[Lucio Costa]] (1902–1998) and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (1907–2012).  Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1936–43) and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.  Following the war, Niemeyer, along with Le Corbusier, conceived the form of the [[United Nations Headquarters]] constructed by Walter Harrison.

Lucio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil;  the creation of a new capital, [[Brasilia]], constructed between 1956 and 1961.  Costa made the general plan, laid out in the form of a cross, with the major government buildings in the center.  Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings, including the palace of the President;the National Assembly, composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls, one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola. Niemeyer also built the cathedral, eighteen ministries, and giant blocks of housing, each designed for three thousand residents, each with its own school, shops, and chapel. Modernism was employed both as an architectural principle and as a guideline for organizing society, as explored in ''[[The Modernist City]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19722338|title=The modernist city : an anthropological critique of Brasília|last=James.|first=Holston,|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226349794|location=Chicago|oclc=19722338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a military coup d'état in Brazil in 1964, Niemeyer moved to France, where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris (1965–1980), a miniature of his United Nations plan.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=165-167}}

Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement.  Important figures included Félix Candela, born in Spain, who emigrated to Mexico in 1939, and participated in the construction of the new University of Mexico City;  he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms. Another important figure was [[Mario Pani]], who designed the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in Mexico City (1949), and the [[Torre Insignia]] (1988). [[Augusto H. Alvarez]] designed the [[Torre Latinamericano]], one of the early modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City (1956);  it successfully withstood the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which destroyed many other buildings in the city center.  1964. [[Pedro Ramirez Vasquez]] and [[Rafael Mijares]]  designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics, and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports. [[Luis Barragan]] was another influential figure in Mexican modernism;  his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside, while inside it features great simplicity in form, pure colors, abundant natural light, and, one of is signatures, a stairway without a railing.  He won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] in 1980,  and the house was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=166}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Japan, like Europe, had an enormous shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities.  4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced.  Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques.  One of the foremost Japanese modernists was [[Kunio Maekawa]] (1905–1986), who had worked for Le Corbusier in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier.  His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.

[[Kenzo Tange]] (1913–2005) worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm. His first major commission was the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] .  He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers. office buildings, as well as the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.  The gymasim, built of concrete, features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables.

The Danish architect [[Jorn Utzon]] (1918-) worked briefly with [[Alvar Aalto]], studied the work of Le Corbusier, and traveled to the United States to meet [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world;  the [[Sydney Opera House]]..  He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings, and their relationship with the landscape. The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach.  Begun in 1957, the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right. Utzon resigned in 1966, and the opera house was not finished until 1973, ten years after its scheduled completion.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=157}}

==Preservation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]]. In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau, these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article: the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] in Utrecht, the [[Bauhaus]] structures in Weimar and Dessau, the [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates]], the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]], the city of [[Asmara]], the city of [[Brasilia]], the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] of [[UNAM]] in Mexico City and the [[University City of Caracas]] in Venezuela, and the [[Sydney Opera House]].

Private organizations such as [[Docomomo International]], the [[World Monuments Fund]], and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund launched [[World Monuments Fund#Modernism at Risk|''Modernism at Risk'']], an advocacy and conservation program.

'''''N''-Ethylmaleimide''' (NEM) is an [[organic compound]] that is derived from [[maleic acid]].  It contains the [[imide]] [[functional group]], but more importantly it is an [[alkene]] that is reactive toward [[thiol]]s and is commonly used to modify cysteine residues in proteins and peptides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://probes.invitrogen.com/handbook/sections/0201.html Thiol reactive probes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128194422/http://probes.invitrogen.com/handbook/sections/0201.html |date=2008-01-28 }} at [[Invitrogen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic chemistry==
NEM is a Michael Acceptor in [[Michael Reaction]], which means that it adds nucleophiles such as thiols.  The resulting thioether features a strong C-S bond and the reaction is virtually irreversible.  Reaction with thiols occur in the [[pH]] range 6.5–7.5, NEM may react with amines or undergo hydrolysis at a more alkaline pH.  NEM has been widely used to probe the functional role of thiol groups in [[enzymology]]. NEM is an irreversible inhibitor of all [[cysteine protease|cysteine peptidases]], with [[alkylation]] occurring at the active site [[thiol]] group (see schematic).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, J. D. (1955) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 3922-3923&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:NEMmech.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Mechanism of irreversible inhibition of a cysteine peptidase with NEM.]]

==Case studies==
NEM blocks [[vesicular transport]]. In lysis buffers, 20 to 25 [[Molarity#Molarity|mM]] of NEM is used to inhibit de-[[sumoylation]] of proteins for [[Western Blot]] analysis. NEM has also been used as an inhibitor of deubiquitinases.

''N''-Ethylmaleimide was used by [[Arthur Kornberg]] and colleagues to knock out [[DNA polymerase III]] in order to compare its activity to that of [[DNA polymerase I]] (pol III and I, respectively). Kornberg had been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering pol I, then believed to be the mechanism of [[bacteria]]l [[DNA replication]], although in this experiment he showed that pol III was the actual replicative machinery.

NEM activates ouabain-insensitive Cl-dependent K efflux in low K sheep and goat red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;A chloride dependent K+ flux induced by N ethylmaleimide in genetically low K+ sheep and goat erythrocytes.P.K. Lauf and B.E. Theg. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The '''Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service''' ({{lang-fr|Service hydrographique et océanographique de la Marine}} or SHOM) is a French public establishment of an administrative nature ({{lang-fr|[[établissement public à caractère administratif]]}}) administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].  It is the successor to the Dépôt des cartes et plans de la Marine, founded in 1720 which became the Naval Hydrographic Service in 1886 and the Naval and Oceanographic Service in 1971. Its present form was set up by decree number 2007-800 on 11 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=DEFD0750453D Decree number 2007-800 of 11 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its board is presided over by the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]] ({{lang-fr|Chef d'État-Major de la Marine}}) and the body is directed by a director-general.

== Aims ==

This public body has several aims, including the provision of :
* a public service in [[hydrography]] and maritime [[cartography]], including the collection, elaboration, confirmation and spread of nautical information useful to civil or naval navigators and to all who sail for professional or pleasure, as well as those responsible for care of the coast
* to support the navy's hydrographers, [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s concerning specific information on maritime matters to ensure the optimal running of the navy's weapons systems (radar, sonar, infra-red sensors, carrier-borne aircraft etc.).

SHOM is made up of oceanographic and hydrographic groups, as well as a school, and employs 500 naval and civil personnel.  Its fleets consists of 5 boats: the [[French ship Beautemps-Beaupré (2002)|''Beautemps-Beaupré'']], the ''Borda'', the ''La Pérouse'', the ''Laplace'' and the ''[[Pourquoi-Pas ? (2005)|Pourquoi-Pas ?]]''.  SHOM works in cooperation with many other national organisations, including [[IFREMER]] (with whom it shares the ''Pourquoi-Pas ?''), [[Météo-France]], the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], the [[University of Western Brittany]] and the [[Institut géographique national (France)|IGN]].

It participates in international hydrographic projects and programmes co-ordinated by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]], of which France is a member.

== Publications ==
Among the SHOM's nautical publications are
*[[maritime chart]]s in paper or electronic form ("cartes électroniques de navigation" or ENC)
*signal books, containing audio and visual signals for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore use, as well as details of French lighthouses
*Radio signal-books, for radio-electric navigation aids and radio-communications
*nautical instructions and nautical instructions for those who sail for pleasure
*tidal almanacks and atlas of currents
* Guides and works on navigation :
** navigator's guides
** a guide to the symbols and abbreviations on maritime charts (1D)
** International rules for preventing maritime accidents (Réglement international pour prévenir les abordages en mer, or RIPAM) (2A and 2B)
** Maritime signals (3C)
* the "Groupe d'avis aux navigateurs", a weekly bulletin with corrections to the above works

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">A '''Networked Control System''' ('''NCS''') is a [[control system]] wherein the control loops are closed through a communication [[computer network|network]]. The defining feature of an NCS is that control and feedback signals are exchanged among the system's components in the form of information packages through a network.

== Overview ==
The functionality of a typical NCS is established by the use of four basic elements: 
# [[Sensors]], to acquire information,
# [[Controller (control theory)|Controllers]], to provide decision and commands,
# [[Actuators]], to perform the control commands and
# [[Telecommunication network|Communication network]], to enable exchange of information.

The most important feature of a NCS is that it connects cyberspace to physical space enabling the execution of several tasks from long distance. In addition, networked control systems eliminate unnecessary wiring reducing the complexity and the overall cost in designing and implementing the control systems. They can also be easily modified or upgraded by adding sensors, actuators and controllers to them with relatively low cost and no major changes in their structure. Moreover, featuring efficient sharing of data between their controllers, NCS are able to easily fuse global information to make intelligent decisions over large physical spaces. 
                                                                                     
Their potential applications are numerous and cover a wide range of industries such as: space and terrestrial exploration, access in hazardous environments, factory automation, remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, experimental facilities, domestic robots, aircraft, automobiles, manufacturing plant monitoring, nursing homes and tele-operations. While the potential applications of NCS are numerous, the proven applications are few, and the real opportunity in the area of NCS is in developing real-world applications that realize the area's potential.

===Types of communication networks===
* [[Fieldbus]]es, e.g. CAN, LON etc.
* IP/[[Ethernet]]
* Wireless networks, e.g. [[Bluetooth]] or [[ZigBee|ZigBee or Zwave]]. The term [[Wireless Networked Control System]] (WNCS) is often used in this connection.

===Problems and solutions===
[[File:ISpace.jpg|320px|thumb|right|iSpace concept]]
Advent and development of the Internet combined with the advantages provided by NCS attracted the interest of researchers around the globe. Along with the advantages, several challenges also emerged giving rise to many important research topics. New control strategies, kinematics of the actuators in the systems, reliability and security of communications, bandwidth allocation, development of data communication protocols, corresponding [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] and [[fault tolerant]] control strategies, real-time information collection and efficient processing of sensors data are some of the relative topics studied in depth.

The insertion of the communication network in the feedback [[control loop]] makes the analysis and design of an NCS complex, since it imposes additional time delays in control loops or possibility of packages loss. Depending on the application, time-delays could impose severe degradation on the system performance.

To alleviate the time-delay effect, Y. Tipsuwan and M-Y. Chow, in ADAC Lab at North Carolina State University, proposed the [[Gain Scheduler Middleware]] (GSM) methodology and applied it in iSpace. S. Munir and W.J. Book (Georgia Institute of Technology) used a [[Smith predictor]], a [[Kalman filter]] and an energy regulator to perform teleoperation through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/ ADAC Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/iSpace1/home.html iSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

K.C. Lee, S. Lee and H.H. Lee used a genetic algorithm to design a controller used in a NCS. Many other researchers provided solutions using concepts from several control areas such as robust control, optimal [[stochastic control]], model predictive control, fuzzy logic etc.

Moreover, a most critical and important issue surrounding the design of distributed NCSs with the successively increasing complexity is to meet the requirements on system reliability and dependability, while guaranteeing a high system performance over a wide operating range. This makes network based fault detection and diagnosis techniques, which are essential to monitor the system performance,  receive more and more attention.

{{Millennium Problems}}

The '''P versus NP problem''' is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]]. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in [[polynomial time]]) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).

The underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from [[John Forbes Nash Jr.]] to the [[National Security Agency]], and from [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]]. The precise statement of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = L.

The informal term ''quickly'', used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the task that runs in [[polynomial time]], such that the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, [[exponential time]]). The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called "class '''P'''" or just "'''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be ''verified'' in polynomial time is called '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', which stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A nondeterministic [[Turing machine]] can move to a state that is not determined by the previous state. Such a machine could solve an '''NP''' problem in polynomial time by falling into the correct answer state (by luck), then conventionally verifying it. Such machines are not practical for solving realistic problems but can be used as theoretical models.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider [[Sudoku]], a game where the player is given a partially filled-in grid of numbers and attempts to complete the grid following certain rules. Given an incomplete Sudoku grid, of any size, is there at least one legal solution?  Any proposed solution is easily verified, and the time to check a solution grows slowly (polynomially) as the grid gets bigger.  However, all known algorithms for finding solutions take, for difficult examples, time that grows exponentially as the grid gets bigger.  So, Sudoku is in '''NP''' (quickly checkable) but does not seem to be in '''P''' (quickly solvable).  Thousands of other problems seem similar, in that they are fast to check but slow to solve.  Researchers have shown that many of the problems in '''NP''' have the extra property that a fast solution to any one of them could be used to build a quick solution to any other problem in '''NP''', a property called [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-completeness]].  Decades of searching have not yielded a fast solution to any of these problems, so most scientists suspect that none of these problems can be solved quickly.  This, however, has never been proven.

An answer to the '''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time, like Sudoku, can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''', it would mean that there are problems in '''NP'''  that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.

Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, [[artificial intelligence]], [[game theory]], multimedia processing, [[philosophy]], [[economics]] and many other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Ticket: P, NP, and the Search for the Impossible|last=Fortnow|first=Lance|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780691156491|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences.  In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters from John Nash |url=https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/nash-letters/nash_letters1.pdf |author=NSA |year=2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;  If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what is now called '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''', since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]].  Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be [[co-NP-complete|'''co-NP'''-complete]]) could be solved in [[quadratic time|quadratic]] or [[linear time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartmanis | first1 = Juris | year = | title = Gödel, von Neumann, and the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem | url = http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 101–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out one of the most important consequences—that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.

==Context==
The relation between the [[complexity class]]es '''P''' and '''NP''' is studied in [[computational complexity theory]], the part of the [[theory of computation]] dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).

In such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is ''[[Deterministic computation|deterministic]]'' (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and ''sequential'' (it performs actions one after the other).

In this theory, the class '''P''' consists of all those ''[[decision problem]]s'' (defined [[#Formal definitions|below]]) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is [[polynomial]] in the size of the input; the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in [[polynomial time]] given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser, Michael: ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Second Edition, International Edition'', page 270. Thomson Course Technology, 2006. Definition 7.19 and Theorem 7.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, '''P''' ⊆ '''NP'''. Arguably the biggest open question in [[theoretical computer science]] concerns the relationship between those two classes:
:Is '''P''' equal to '''NP'''?
In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 believed the answer to be no, 9 believed the answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the question may be [[independent (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William I. Gasarch| author1-link=William Gasarch | title=The '''P'''=?'''NP''' poll.|journal=[[SIGACT News]]|volume=33|issue=2|pages=34–47|date=June 2002| url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll.pdf|doi=10.1145/564585.564599|format=PDF|accessdate=26 September 2018| citeseerx=10.1.1.172.1005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 10 years later, the same poll was repeated. The number of researchers who answered was 151: 126 (83%) believed the answer to be no, 12 (9%) believed the answer is yes, 5 (3%) believed the question may be [[independent (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.&lt;ref name="poll2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William I. Gasarch| author1-link=William Gasarch | title=The Second '''P'''=?'''NP''' poll|journal=SIGACT News|volume=74|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll2012.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NP-completeness==
[[File:P np np-complete np-hard.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Euler diagram]] for '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', '''NP'''-complete, and '''NP'''-hard set of problems (excluding the empty language and its complement, which belong to '''P''' but are not '''NP'''-complete)]]
{{Main article|NP-completeness}}
To attack the '''P''' = '''NP''' question, the concept of '''NP'''-completeness is very useful. '''NP'''-complete problems are a set of problems to each of which any other '''NP'''-problem can be reduced in polynomial time, and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any '''NP''' problem can be transformed into any of the '''NP'''-complete problems. Informally, an '''NP'''-complete problem is an '''NP '''problem that is at least as "tough" as any other problem in '''NP'''.

[[NP-hard|'''NP'''-hard]] problems are those at least as hard as '''NP''' problems, i.e., all '''NP''' problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. '''NP'''-hard problems need not be in '''NP''', i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.

For instance, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is '''NP'''-complete by the [[Cook–Levin theorem]], so ''any'' instance of ''any'' problem in '''NP''' can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many such '''NP'''-complete problems. If any '''NP'''-complete problem is in '''P''', then it would follow that '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, many important problems have been shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.

Based on the definition alone it is not obvious that '''NP'''-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived '''NP'''-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a description of a [[Turing machine]] ''M'' guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that ''M'' will accept?&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Scott Aaronson|title=PHYS771 Lecture 6: '''P''', '''NP''', and Friends|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec6.html |accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in '''NP''' because (given an input) it is simple to check whether ''M'' accepts the input by simulating ''M''; it is '''NP'''-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in '''NP''' can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine ''M'' that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.

The first natural problem proven to be '''NP'''-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is '''NP'''-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of '''NP'''. However, after this problem was proved to be '''NP'''-complete, [[reduction (complexity)|proof by reduction]] provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also '''NP'''-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete [[Latin square]]s in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NP-completeness of Sudoku |url=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/FCS/sudoku.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning [[multipartite graph|tri-partite graphs]] into triangles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Colbourn, Charles J. |title=The complexity of completing partial Latin squares |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=25–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=I. Holyer |title=The '''NP'''-completeness of some edge-partition problems |journal=SIAM J. Comput. |volume=10 |year=1981 |pages=713&amp;ndash;717}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability.  So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other '''NP'''-complete problem in polynomial time.  Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense "the same problem".

==Harder problems==
{{See also|Complexity class}}

Although it is unknown whether '''P''' = '''NP''', problems outside of '''P''' are known. Just as the class '''P''' is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class '''[[EXPTIME]]''' is the set of all decision problems that have ''exponential'' running time. In other words, any problem in '''EXPTIME''' is solvable by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[big O notation|O]](2&lt;sup&gt;''p''(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;) time, where ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial function of ''n''. A decision problem is [[EXPTIME#EXPTIME-complete|'''EXPTIME'''-complete]] if it is in '''EXPTIME''', and every problem in '''EXPTIME''' has a [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]] to it. A number of problems are known to be '''EXPTIME'''-complete. Because it can be shown that '''P''' ≠ '''EXPTIME''', these problems are outside '''P''', and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the [[time hierarchy theorem]], they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for [[chess]] positions on an ''N'' × ''N'' board&lt;ref name="Fraenkel1981"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D. Lichtenstein| title = Computing a perfect strategy for ''n'' × ''n'' chess requires time exponential in ''n''| journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory|Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A]]| volume = 31| issue = 2| year = 1981| pages = 199–214 | doi = 10.1016/0097-3165(81)90016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar problems for other board games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Computational Complexity of Games and Puzzles |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/hard.html |author=[[David Eppstein]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of deciding the truth of a statement in [[Presburger arithmetic]] requires even more time. Fischer and [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] proved in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Michael J. | last1=Fischer | authorlink1=Michael J. Fischer | first2=Michael O. | last2=Rabin | authorlink2=Michael O. Rabin | date=1974 | title=Super-Exponential Complexity of Presburger Arithmetic | url=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/ps/MIT-LCS-TM-043.ps | journal=Proceedings of the SIAM-AMS Symposium in Applied Mathematics | volume=7 | pages=27–41 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements of length ''n'' has a runtime of at least &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{cn}}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c''. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the [[undecidable problem]]s, such as the [[halting problem]]. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.

It is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems.  One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called [[Sharp-P#P|'''#P''']]: whereas an '''NP''' problem asks "Are there any solutions?", the corresponding '''#P''' problem asks "How many solutions are there?"  Clearly, a '''#P''' problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding '''NP''' problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some '''#P''' problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) '''P''' problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valiant, Leslie G. |title=The complexity of enumeration and reliability problems |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=410–421 |doi=10.1137/0208032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many.  Many of these problems are [[Sharp-P-complete|'''#P'''-complete]], and hence among the hardest problems in '''#P''', since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other '''#P''' problems.

==Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete==
{{Main article|NP-intermediate|l1='''NP'''-intermediate}}
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP'''-complete.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called '''NP'''-intermediate problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be '''NP'''-intermediate. They are some of the very few '''NP''' problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP'''-complete.

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP'''-complete, or '''NP'''-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not '''NP'''-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{cite journal

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]], has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O({{radic|''n'' log ''n''}})&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices.

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''[[co-NP]]''' (and even in '''UP''' and '''co-UP'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: [http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring]. 13 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP'''-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' = '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes expected time

:&lt;math&gt;O\left (\exp \left ( \left (\tfrac{64n}{9} \log(2) \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} \left ( \log(n\log(2)) \right )^{\frac{2}{3}} \right) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

to factor an ''n''-bit integer. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

==Does P mean "easy"?==
[[File:KnapsackEmpComplexity.GIF|thumb|310 px|The graph shows time (average of 100 instances in ms using a 933 MHz Pentium III) vs.problem size for knapsack problems for a state-of-the-art specialized algorithm.

"Where are the hard knapsack problems?" Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;]]
All of the above discussion has assumed that '''P''' means "easy" and "not in '''P'''" means "hard", an assumption known as ''[[Cobham's thesis]]''. It is a common and reasonably accurate assumption in complexity theory; however, it has some caveats.

First, it is not always true in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents thus rendering it impractical. On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and even if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many '''NP'''-complete problems, such as the [[knapsack problem]], the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical [[average-case complexity]] (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.  An example is the [[simplex algorithm]] in [[linear programming]], which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case [[time complexity]] it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gondzio|first1=Jacek|last2=Terlaky|first2=Tamás|chapter=3 A computational view of interior point methods |mr=1438311 |title=Advances in linear and integer programming|pages=103–144|editor=J.&amp;nbsp;E.

Second, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which '''P''' and '''NP''' are defined, such as [[quantum computation]] and [[randomized algorithm]]s.

==Reasons to believe P ≠ NP==
According to polls,&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='''P''' vs. '''NP''' poll results|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=May 2012|volume=55|issue=5|page=10|first=Jack|last=Rosenberger|url=http://mags.acm.org/communications/201205?pg=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; most computer scientists believe that '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known '''NP'''-complete problems (see [[List of NP-complete problems|List of '''NP'''-complete problems]]). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of '''NP'''-completeness was even defined ([[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|Karp's 21 '''NP'''-complete problems]], among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be '''NP'''-complete). Furthermore, the result '''P''' = '''NP''' would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as '''NP''' = '''[[co-NP]]''' and '''P''' = '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]'''.

It is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but for which the solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122 |author=Scott Aaronson |title=Reasons to believe}}, point 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some researchers believe that there is overconfidence in believing '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' and that researchers should explore proofs of '''P''' = '''NP''' as well. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:&lt;ref name="poll" /&gt;

==Consequences of solution==
One of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer.  Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.

===P = NP===
A proof that '''P''' = '''NP''' could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in '''NP'''. It is also possible that a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if the proof is [[non-constructive proof|non-constructive]], or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various '''NP'''-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.

Cryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Exactly how efficient a solution must be to pose a threat to cryptography depends on the details.  A solution of &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; with a reasonable constant term would be disastrous.  On the other hand, a solution that is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N^4)&lt;/math&gt; in almost all cases would not pose an immediate practical danger.&lt;/ref&gt; to an '''NP'''-complete problem such as [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] would break most existing cryptosystems including:
* Existing implementations of [[public-key cryptography]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Hard instance generation for SAT |author=Horie, S. and Watanabe, O. |journal=Algorithms and Computation |pages=22–31 |year=1997

* [[Symmetric cipher]]s such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Triple DES|3DES]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite journal |title=Logical cryptanalysis as a SAT problem |author1=Massacci, F.  |author2=Marraro, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=165–203 |year=2000 |citeseerx=10.1.1.104.962 |doi=10.1023/A:1006326723002}} in which an instance of DES is encoded as a SAT problem with 10336 variables and 61935 clauses.  A 3DES problem instance would be about 3 times this size.&lt;/ref&gt; used for the encryption of communications data.
* [[Cryptographic hash function|Cryptographic hashing]] as the problem of finding a pre-image that hashes to a given value must be difficult in order to be useful, and ideally should require exponential time. However, if '''P'''='''NP''', then finding a pre-image ''M'' can be done in polynomial time, through reduction to SAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inversion attacks on secure hash functions using SAT solvers

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These would need to be modified or replaced by [[information-theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] solutions not inherently based on '''P'''-'''NP''' equivalence.

On the other hand, there are enormous positive consequences that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in [[operations research]] are '''NP'''-complete, such as some types of [[integer programming]] and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in [[protein structure prediction]], are also '''NP'''-complete;&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Bonnie Berger|Berger B]], [[F. Thomson Leighton|Leighton T]] |title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is '''NP'''-complete |journal=J. Comput.

But such changes may pale in significance compared to the revolution an efficient method for solving '''NP'''-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. Gödel, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:&lt;ref&gt;History of this letter and its translation from {{cite web |title=The History and Status of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' question |author=Michael Sipser |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/people/trevisan/cs172-07/sipser92history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research.att.com/techdocs/TD_100899.pdf |title=A Brief History of NP-Completeness, 1954–2012 |author=David S.

Similarly, [[Stephen Cook]] says&lt;ref name="Official Problem Description"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|title=The '''P''' versus '''NP''' Problem|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]] |date=April 2000 |url=http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/pvsnp.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] took over three centuries to prove. A method that is guaranteed to find proofs to theorems, should one exist of a "reasonable" size, would essentially end this struggle.

[[Donald Knuth]] has stated that he has come to believe that '''P''' = '''NP''', but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858&amp;WT.rss_f=Article&amp;WT.rss_a=Twenty%20Questions%20for%20Donald%20Knuth&amp;WT.rss_ev=a|title=Twenty Questions for Donald Knuth|date=May 20, 2014|work=informit.com|publisher=[[InformIT (publisher)|InformIT]]|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[...] I don't believe that the equality '''P''' = '''NP''' will turn out to be helpful even if it is proved, because such a proof will almost surely be nonconstructive.}}

===P ≠ NP===
A proof that showed that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that '''P''' = '''NP''', but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', much of this focusing of research has already taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Heuristic Problem-Solving Approach |author=L. R. Foulds |journal=[[Journal of the Operational Research Society]] |volume=34 |issue=10 |date=October 1983 |pages=927–934 |jstor=2580891 |doi=10.2307/2580891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' still leaves open the [[average-case complexity]] of hard problems in '''NP'''.  For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. [[Russell Impagliazzo]] has described five hypothetical "worlds" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question.&lt;ref&gt;R. Impagliazzo, [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/average.ps "A personal view of average-case complexity,"] sct, pp.134, 10th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference (SCT'95), 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  These range from "Algorithmica", where '''P''' = '''NP''' and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to "Cryptomania", where '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' and generating hard instances of problems outside '''P''' is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of '''NP'''-hard problems.  The "world" where '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' but all problems in '''NP''' are tractable in the average case is called "Heuristica" in the paper. A [[Princeton University]] workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2009/05/program-for-workshop-on-impagliazzos-worlds/|title = Tentative program for the workshop on "Complexity and Cryptography: Status of Impagliazzo's Worlds"|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115034042/http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2009/05/program-for-workshop-on-impagliazzos-worlds/|archivedate = 2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results about difficulty of proof==
Although the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques.  In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are not powerful enough to answer the question, thus suggesting that novel technical approaches are required.

As additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in [[computational complexity theory]] fall into one of the following classifications, each of which is known to be insufficient to prove that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''':
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Classification
!Definition
|-
|[[Relativizing proof]]s
|Imagine a world where every algorithm is allowed to make queries to some fixed subroutine called an ''[[oracle machine|oracle]]'' (a black box which can answer a fixed set of questions in constant time, such as a black box that solves any given traveling salesman problem in 1 step), and the running time of the oracle is not counted against the running time of the algorithm. Most proofs (especially classical ones) apply uniformly in a world with oracles regardless of what the oracle does. These proofs are called ''relativizing''. In 1975, Baker, Gill, and [[Robert M. Solovay|Solovay]] showed that '''P''' = '''NP''' with respect to some oracles, while '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' for other oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. P. Baker |author2=J. Gill |author3=R. Solovay. |title=Relativizations of the '''P''' =? '''NP''' Question |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=431–442 |year=1975 |doi=10.1137/0204037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since relativizing proofs can only prove statements that are uniformly true with respect to all possible oracles, this showed that relativizing techniques cannot resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|[[Natural proof]]s
|In 1993, [[Alexander Razborov]] and [[Steven Rudich]] defined a general class of proof techniques for circuit complexity lower bounds, called ''[[natural proof]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Razborov, Alexander A. |author2=Steven Rudich |title=Natural proofs |journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=24–35 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009791494X |doi=10.1006/jcss.1997.1494}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time all previously known circuit lower bounds were natural, and circuit complexity was considered a very promising approach for resolving '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, Razborov and Rudich showed that, if [[one-way functions]] exist, then no natural proof method can distinguish between '''P''' and '''NP'''. Although one-way functions have never been formally proven to exist, most mathematicians believe that they do, and a proof of their existence would be a much stronger statement than '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''. Thus it is unlikely that natural proofs alone can resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|Algebrizing proofs
|After the Baker-Gill-Solovay result, new non-relativizing proof techniques were successfully used to prove that [[IP (complexity)|IP]] = [[PSPACE]]. However, in 2008, [[Scott Aaronson]] and [[Avi Wigderson]] showed that the main technical tool used in the '''IP''' = '''PSPACE''' proof, known as ''arithmetization'', was also insufficient to resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=S. Aaronson  |author2=A. Wigderson  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory |conference=Proceedings of ACM STOC'2008 |year=2008 |url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf |doi=10.1145/1374376.1374481 |pages=731–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These barriers are another reason why '''NP'''-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an '''NP'''-complete problem, this would solve the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem in a way not excluded by the above results.

These barriers have also led some computer scientists to suggest that the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem may be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of standard axiom systems like [[ZFC]] (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any '''NP'''-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for '''NP'''-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/indep.pdf|first=Scott|last=Aaronson|authorlink=Scott Aaronson|title=Is '''P''' Versus '''NP''' Formally Independent?|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the [[Peano axioms]] (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the independence of '''P''' versus '''NP'''|first1=Shai|last1=Ben-David |first2=Shai|last2=Halevi |series=Technical Report|volume=714|publisher=Technion|year=1992|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shai/ph.ps.gz|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in '''NP''' have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in '''NP'''.

==Logical characterizations==
The '''P''' = '''NP''' problem can be restated in terms of expressible certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in [[descriptive complexity]].

Consider all languages of finite structures with a fixed [[signature (logic)|signature]] including a [[linear order]] relation. Then, all such languages in '''P''' can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] with the addition of a suitable least [[fixed-point combinator]]. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes '''P'''.

Similarly, '''NP''' is the set of languages expressible in existential [[second-order logic]]—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude [[universal quantification]] over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the [[polynomial hierarchy]], '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''', correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question "is '''P''' a proper subset of '''NP'''" can be reformulated as "is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?".&lt;ref&gt;Elvira Mayordomo. [http://www.unizar.es/acz/05Publicaciones/Monografias/MonografiasPublicadas/Monografia26/057Mayordomo.pdf "P versus NP"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216154228/http://www.unizar.es/acz/05Publicaciones/Monografias/MonografiasPublicadas/Monografia26/057Mayordomo.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }} ''Monografías de la Real Academia de Ciencias de Zaragoza'' '''26''': 57–68 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The word "existential" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since '''P''' = '''NP''' if and only if '''P''' = '''PH''' (as the former would establish that '''NP''' = '''co-NP''', which in turn implies that '''NP''' = '''PH''').

==Polynomial-time algorithms==
No algorithm for any '''NP'''-complete problem is known to run in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for '''NP'''-complete problems with the property that if '''P''' = '''NP''', then the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to [[Leonid Levin|Levin]] (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the '''NP'''-complete language [[subset sum problem|SUBSET-SUM]]. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if '''P''' = '''NP''':

 ''// Algorithm that accepts the '''NP'''-complete language SUBSET-SUM.
 ''//
 ''// this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if '''P''' = '''NP'''.
 ''//
 ''// "Polynomial-time" means it returns "yes" in polynomial time when
 ''// the answer should be "yes", and runs forever when it is "no".
 ''//
 ''// Input: S = a finite set of integers
 ''// Output: "yes" if any subset of S adds up to 0.
 ''// Runs forever with no output otherwise.
 ''// Note: "Program number M" is the program obtained by
 ''// writing the integer M in binary, then
 ''// considering that string of bits to be a
 ''// program. Every possible program can be
 ''// generated this way, though most do nothing
 ''// because of syntax errors.''
 FOR K = 1...∞
   FOR M = 1...K
     Run program number M for K steps with input S
     IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers
       AND the integers are all in S
       AND the integers sum to 0
     THEN
       OUTPUT "yes" and HALT

If, and only if, '''P''' = '''NP''', then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an '''NP'''-complete language. "Accepting" means it gives "yes" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is "no" (also known as a ''semi-algorithm'').

This algorithm is enormously impractical, even if '''P''' = '''NP'''. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is ''b'' bits long, the above algorithm will try at least {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} other programs first.

==Formal definitions==

===P and NP===
Conceptually speaking, a ''decision problem'' is a problem that takes as input some [[String (computer science)|string]] ''w'' over an alphabet Σ, and outputs "yes" or "no". If there is an [[algorithm]] (say a [[Turing machine]], or a [[Computer programming|computer program]] with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length ''n'' in at most ''cn&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' steps, where ''k'' and ''c'' are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in ''polynomial time'' and we place it in the class '''P'''. Formally, '''P''' is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \{ L : L=L(M) \text{ for some deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine } M \}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;L(M) = \{ w\in\Sigma^{*}: M \text{ accepts } w \}&lt;/math&gt;
and a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' that satisfies the following two conditions:

# ''M'' halts on all input ''w'' and
# there exists &lt;math&gt;k \in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T_M(n)\in O(n^k)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''O'' refers to the [[Big O notation#Formal definition|big O notation]] and
::&lt;math&gt;T_M(n) = \max\{ t_M(w) : w\in\Sigma^{*}, |w| = n \}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;t_M(w) = \text{ number of steps }M\text{ takes to halt on input }w.&lt;/math&gt;

'''NP''' can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define '''NP''' is to use the concept of ''[[Certificate (complexity)|certificate]]'' and ''verifier''. Formally, '''NP''' is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of "verifier" is defined as follows.

Let ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet, Σ.

''L'' ∈ '''NP''' if, and only if, there exists a binary relation &lt;math&gt;R\subset\Sigma^{*}\times\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and a positive integer ''k'' such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

# &lt;abbr title="For all strings x in Σ*, x is in L if and only if there is a y in Σ* such that (x, y) is in R and the length of y is polynomial in the length of x"&gt;For all &lt;math&gt;x\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in L \Leftrightarrow\exists y\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' and &lt;math&gt;|y|\in O(|x|^k)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;; and
# the language &lt;abbr title="L[R], consisting of x followed by y with a delimiter in the middle"&gt;&lt;math&gt;L_{R} = \{ x\# y:(x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\cup\{\#\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; is decidable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.

A Turing machine that decides ''L&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called a ''verifier'' for ''L'' and a ''y'' such that (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' is called a ''certificate of membership'' of ''x'' in ''L''.

In general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for ''L'' to be in '''NP''', there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.

====Example====
Let
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COMPOSITE} = \left \{x\in\mathbb{N} \mid x=pq \text{ for integers } p, q &gt; 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \left \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N} \times\mathbb{N} \mid 1&lt;y \leq \sqrt x \text{ and } y \text{ divides } x \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, the question of whether a given ''x'' is a [[Composite number|composite]] is equivalent to the question of whether ''x'' is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ '''NP''' by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).

COMPOSITE also happens to be in '''P''', a fact demonstrated by the invention of the [[AKS primality test]].&lt;ref name="Agrawal"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Manindra |last=Agrawal |first2=Neeraj |last2=Kayal |first3=Nitin |last3=Saxena |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf |title=PRIMES is in '''P''' |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=160 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=781–793 |doi=10.4007/annals.2004.160.781 |jstor=3597229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NP-completeness===
{{Main|NP-completeness}}

There are many equivalent ways of describing '''NP'''-completeness.

Let ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet Σ.

''L'' is '''NP'''-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:

# ''L'' ∈ '''NP'''; and
# any ''L′'' in '''NP''' is polynomial-time-reducible to ''L'' (written as &lt;math&gt;L' \leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;L' \leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:
## There exists ''f'' : Σ* → Σ* such that for all ''w'' in Σ* we have: &lt;math&gt;(w\in L' \Leftrightarrow f(w)\in L)&lt;/math&gt;; and
## there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with ''f''(''w'') on its tape on any input ''w''.

Alternatively, if ''L'' ∈ '''NP''', and there is another '''NP'''-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to ''L'', then ''L'' is '''NP'''-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is '''NP'''-complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">The '''Photochemical Reflectance Index''' ('''PRI''') is a reflectance measurement developed by [[John Gamon]] during his tenure as a postdoctorate fellow supervised by [[Christopher Field]] at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University. The PRI is sensitive to changes in [[carotenoid]] pigments (e.g. [[xanthophyll]] pigments) in live [[foliage]]. Carotenoid pigments are indicative of photosynthetic light use efficiency, or the rate of [[carbon dioxide]] uptake by foliage per unit energy absorbed. As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Because the PRI measures plant responses to stress, it can be used to assess general ecosystem health using satellite data or other forms of remote sensing. Applications include [[vegetation health]] in evergreen [[shrubland]]s, forests, and agricultural crops prior to [[senescence]]. PRI is defined by the following equation using reflectance (ρ) at 531 and 570&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength:

:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{(\rho 531- \rho 570)}{( \rho 531+ \rho 570)}&lt;/math&gt;
Some authors use
:&lt;math&gt;PRI=\frac{( \rho 570- \rho 531)}{( \rho 570+ \rho 531)}&lt;/math&gt;

The values range from –1 to 1.

'''Physiological chemistry''' is the [[chemistry]] of the organs and tissues of the body and of the various physiological processes incident to life.  Physiological chemistry is essentially the precursor to modern [[biochemistry]].  In the nineteenth century, physiological chemistry dealt primarily with extracellular chemistry, such as the chemistry of digestion and other body fluids.  Modern biochemical methods have allowed a much broader study including the chemistry of [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144425/http://www.hssonline.org/teach_res/essays/allen/allenp5.html Life Sciences in the Twentieth Century, Garland E.

==Introduction==
Rabbits were introduced to Australia with the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/04/08/2538860.htm|title=Australia's battle with the bunny|author=Wendy Zukerman|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A population of 24 rabbits released near [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] in 1859 to be hunted for sport. Within 50 years rabbits had spread throughout the most of the continent with devastating impact on indigenous flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/rabbits_introduced|title=Defining moments in Australian history|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=[[National Museum Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

The species had spread throughout Victoria and by 1880 was found in [[New South Wales]]. Rabbits were found in [[South Australia]] and  [[Queensland]] by 1886 and by 1890 were in eastern parts of [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; and the [[Northern Territory]] in the 1900s. Feral rabbits were found throughout most of their current range by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbitfreeaustralia.com.au/rabbits/the-rabbit-problem/|title=The Rabbit Problem|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=Rabbit Free Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12190">The '''Records of Early English Drama (REED)''' is a performance history research project, based at the [[University of Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1976 by a group of international scholars interested in understanding “the native tradition of English playmaking that apparently flourished in late medieval provincial towns”&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the context for the development of the [[English Renaissance theatre]], including the work of [[Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries.  REED’s primary focus is to locate, transcribe, edit, and publish historical documents from England, Wales, and Scotland containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and mimetic ceremony from the late [[Middle Ages]] until 1642, when the [[Puritans]] closed the London public theatres. 

From its inception in 1976 to 2016, REED published twenty-seven print collections of records edited by over thirty international scholars. REED is also engaged in creating a collection of free digital resources for research and education including ''Patrons and Performances''&lt;ref name="PandP"&gt;[https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/ ''Patrons and Performances''] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mlabib.mla.hcommons.org/2014/05/26/website-of-the-week-wow-147-reed-patrons-and-performances-web-site/ Website of the Week (WoW) #147: REED: Patrons and Performances] – entry on the ''Patrons and Performances'' website from the MLA International Bibliography blog, part of [[Modern Languages Association]]’s [https://hcommons.org/ Humanities Commons].  Retrieved 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; (2003) and ''Early Modern London Theatres''&lt;ref name="EMLoT"&gt;[http://www.emlot.kcl.ac.uk/ ''Early Modern London Theatres''] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (2011).  In March 2017, REED moved to digital publication of records with the launch of ''REED Online'',&lt;ref name="REEDonline"&gt;[https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/ ''REED Online''] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;  a publication site where records will be freely available.  

==History==

During a 1970-71 research trip in [[York]], England, to study manuscripts related to the York cycle of biblical plays (also known as the [[York Mystery Plays]]), Alexandra F. Johnston, an early drama scholar from the University of Toronto, came across a manuscript transcription of a 1433 indenture agreement between the leaders of the medieval Mercers' Guild and their pageant masters. The document contained details of a medieval pageant wagon and sophisticated staging unknown to researchers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnston also met Margaret Dorrell, an Australian graduate student at the [[University of Leeds]], who was working on a similar project related to the York records; the two women decided to collaborate.

Within the next two years, Johnston and Dorrell met other scholars of medieval and Renaissance drama working independently on manuscripts from other English cities (David Galloway of the [[University of New Brunswick]] on [[Norwich]], Reginald Ingram of the [[University of British Columbia]] on [[Coventry]], and Lawrence Clopper of [[Indiana University Bloomington]] on [[Chester]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of a scholarly publishing project to find, transcribe, and edit documentary evidence of performance arose from these meetings and was met with interest by the individual researchers and their academic communities. 

In January 1974, Johnston circulated a position paper on the project. Discussions and planning followed and, in February 1975, the inaugural REED meeting was held at [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria University]] in the University of Toronto. In 1975-76, Johnston received a Canada Council personal grant for the publication of the York records as a pilot project, and in late 1976, REED was officially launched with a [[Canada Council]] ten-year Major Editorial Grant for the proposed series of collections, establishing REED as a long-term research and publishing project.  Because three of the four initial collections were edited by Canadian researchers, Toronto, Canada, became the home of the project.  

In 1979, REED published its first two collections of records: York, edited by Alexandra F. Johnston and Margaret Rogerson (née Dorrell), and Chester, edited by Lawrence D. Clopper.  Since then the project has expanded its scope from major cities and towns to all the counties of England, Wales, and Scotland, based on historic pre-1642 county borders.

After its inception in 1976, REED produced the bi-annual ''REED Newsletter'' which, in 1997, became the refereed scholarly journal ''[[Early Theatre]]''. 

REED has had close ties to the English Department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.utoronto.ca/ Department of English, University of Toronto] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre for Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://medieval.utoronto.ca/ Centre for Medieval Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CMS), the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies&lt;ref&gt;[https://crrs.ca/ Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CRRS), and the Graduate Centre for Study of Drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dramacentre.utoronto.ca/ Graduate Centre for Study of Drama] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1976 to 2009 the project was based at Victoria University in the University of Toronto.  In 2009 the offices of the project moved to the English Department.  REED retains active relationships with the English Department, the CMS, and the [[University of Toronto Libraries]]. REED’s internal governance is provided by an Executive Board of senior scholars in early drama and related fields, with digital advisors and collections editors drawn from Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 

REED has collaborated with the [[Poculi Ludique Societas]] (PLS) to mount four productions of full cycles of medieval biblical dramas: the ''York Plays''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beadle |first=Richard |title=The York Plays: A Critical Edition of the York Corpus Christi Play as recorded in British Library Additional ms 35290. |year=2009 |volume=2 vols. |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford UP for the Early English Text Society |isbn=0-1995-9036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the [[York Mystery Plays]]) in 1977 and 1998, and the ''Chester Plays'' (also called the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]) in 1983 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.chass.utoronto.ca/plspls/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/index.html The Chester Plays] - an acting text adapted by Alexandra F. Johnston for the 2010 performances.&lt;/ref&gt; with participation from international amateur theatre groups.

In November 2002, REED, in partnership with the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], hosted the Picturing Shakespeare symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |date=22 December 2001 |title=Experts to Debate Sanders Painting |work=Globe and Mail |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |title=Face-off over a Portrait |work=Globe and Mail |date=20 November 2002 |page=R5}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition of and an accompanying public symposium regarding the [[Sanders portrait]], an Elizabethan painting reputed to be the only one of Shakespeare made during his lifetime.

In addition to revealing evidence of vernacular entertainment activities, the research work for the collections produces a body of knowledge regarding professional travelling entertainers, their patronage, and their performance venues.  This cumulative information was first launched for public use through the Patrons and Performances&lt;ref name="PandP" /&gt; website in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Audrey and Sally-Beth MacLean, “Introduction,” p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, REED collaborated with the [[Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London]], and the Department of English at the [[University of Southampton]] to create ''Early Modern London Theatres''&lt;ref name="EMLoT" /&gt; (''EMLoT''), a research database and educational resource, with learning modules.  ''EMLoT'' gathers documents related to professional theatres north and south of the Thames up to 1642 and bibliographic information about their subsequent transcriptions, documenting how scholars “got [their] information about the early theatres, from whom and when.”&lt;ref&gt;Principal investigator John McGavin quoted in {{cite magazine |last=Reisz |first=Matthew  |title=Reading the Riot Acts and Scenes of London's Violent Theatrical Past |date=3 March 2011 |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reading-the-riot-acts-and-scenes-of-londons-violent-theatrical-past/415326.article |magazine=[[Times Higher Education]] |access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, REED collaborated with the [[BBC]] and [[The British Library]] to produce an ongoing public website titled Shakespeare on Tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 Shakespeare on Tour] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many REED editors contributed stories and images from their research in the Elizabethan period to help raise “the curtain on performances of The Bard’s plays countrywide from the 16th Century to the present day.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 |title=Shakespeare on Tour, Homepage |access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout its existence, REED maintained its primary focus and published about six collections each decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reed.utoronto.ca/print-collections-2/print-collections/ |title=Published Collections |publisher=REED |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, REED published its last print collection (''Civic London to 1558'', edited by Anne Lancashire),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=King |first=Pamela |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/reed-drama/ |title=Unbroken REED |magazine=Times Literary Supplement |date=26 May 2017 |access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2017, the first digital collection (''Staffordshire'', edited by Alan B. Somerset) was made freely available on its publication website, ''REED Online''&lt;ref name="REEDonline" /&gt;. All subsequent collections will be added to this database and website.

REED has received substantial funding from private individuals and foundations (including the Jackman Foundation), the [[Canada Council]], and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] in Canada; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] in the U.S.; as well as the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and [[The British Academy]] in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rynor |first=F.

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F. J. (2007). Rational choice and religious economies. Beckford, J. e Demmerath III. NJ (0rgs.) The Sage Handbook of the Sociology of Religion. London: Sage, 81-97.[http://www.sociology.emory.edu/flechner/Rational%20Choice%20and%20Religious%20Economies.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work is inclined to define the concept in terms of Bourdieu's conception of 'capital' in relation to a particular (religious) field.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM., Trzebiatowska, M. &amp; Brittain, CC. (2011). 'Bourdieu, Capital and Conflict in a Religious Field: The Case of the ‘Homosexuality’ Conflict in the Anglican Communion'. Journal of Contemporary Religion, vol 26, no. 3, pp. 355-370.[http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/4260/1/Religiousfields_author_non_format.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verter, B. (2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">'''Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics''' (SSGL) ({{ISSN|0169-0124}}) is an academic book series that was founded in 1980 by A.A. Barentsen, B.M. Groen and R. Sprenger and is published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

SSGL is mainly devoted to the field of descriptive linguistics. Although SSGL is primarily intended to be a means of publication for linguists from the Low Countries, the editors are pleased to accept contributions by linguists from abroad. SSGL appears at irregular intervals, but the editors aim at bringing out on the average one volume a year.

'''System integration''' is defined in [[engineering]] as the process of bringing together the component sub-[[system]]s into one system (an aggregation of subsystems cooperating so that the system is able to deliver the overarching functionality) and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system,&lt;ref name="Heat"&gt;{{Citation| last = Gilkey| first = Herbert T | year = 1960| contribution = New Air Heating Methods| title= New methods of heating buildings: a research correlation conference conducted by the Building Research Institute, Division of Engineering and Industrial Research, as one of the programs of the BRI fall conferences, November 1959.| publisher=National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute| place=Washington | pages = 60 | oclc =184031}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[information technology]]&lt;ref&gt;For computer systems, the term "systems integration" has included the plural word "systems" although the singular form has also been used in referring to computer systems.&lt;/ref&gt; as the process of linking together different [[computing]] systems and [[software]] [[software application|applications]] physically or functionally,&lt;ref name="SICourse"&gt;{{Citation| title=CIS 8020 – Systems Integration| publisher=Georgia State University OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; to act as a coordinated whole.

The [[system integrator]] [[data integration|integrates]] discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as [[computer network]]ing, [[enterprise application integration]], [[business process management]] or manual [[Computer programming|programming]].&lt;ref name="Info"&gt;{{Citation| last=Moore | first=June | date =13 December 1982| contribution= Software Reviews, BusinessMaster II+, ledger for CP/M systems| title=InfoWorld | publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc| page = 31 | issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

System integration involves integrating existing, often [[disparate system]]s in such a way "that focuses on increasing value to the customer"&lt;ref name="VonderembseAPost97"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A post-industrial paradigm: To integrate and automate manufacturing |journal=International Journal of Production Research |author=Vonderembse, M.A.; Raghunathan, T.S.; Rao, S.S. |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=2579–2600 |year=1997 |doi=10.1080/002075497194679}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., improved product quality and performance) while at the same time providing value to the company (e.g., reducing operational costs and improving response time).&lt;ref name="VonderembseAPost97" /&gt; In the modern world connected by [[Internet]], the role of system integration engineers is important: more and more systems are designed to connect, both within the system under construction and to systems that are already deployed.&lt;ref name="Info2"&gt;{{Citation | last = Merriman| first = Dan| date =19 Feb 1996| contribution = Tying it all together |title=Network World|publisher=IDG Network World Inc| pages = 51|ISSN= 0887-7661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of integration==
'''[[Vertical integration]]''' (as opposed to "[[horizontal integration]]") is the process of integrating subsystems according to their functionality by creating functional entities also referred to as [[Information silo|silos]].&lt;ref name="E-gov"&gt;{{Citation | last = Lau| first = Edwin | year =2005
| contribution = Multi-channel Service Delivery|title=OECD e-Government Studies e-Government for Better Government|publisher=OECD| place =Paris|pages = 52|oclc =224889830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of this method is that the integration is performed quickly and involves only the necessary vendors, therefore, this method is cheaper in the short term. On the other hand, cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher than seen in other methods, since in case of new or enhanced functionality, the only possible way to implement (scale the system) would be by implementing another silo. Reusing subsystems to create another functionality is not possible.&lt;ref name="Integ"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gold-Bernstein| first1 = Beth| last2 = Ruh| first2 = William A| year =2005|title=Enterprise integration: the essential guide to integration solutions|publisher=Addison Wesley|ISBN= 0-321-22390-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star integration''', also known as '''spaghetti integration''', is a process of systems integration where each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems. When observed from the perspective of the subsystem which is being integrated, the connections are reminiscent of a star, but when the overall diagram of the system is presented, the connections look like spaghetti, hence the name of this method. The cost varies because of the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In a case where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost can substantially rise. Time and costs needed to integrate the systems increase exponentially when adding additional subsystems. From the feature perspective, this method often seems preferable, due to the extreme flexibility of the reuse of functionality.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

'''Horizontal integration''' or '''[[Enterprise Service Bus]]''' (ESB) is an integration method in which a specialized subsystem is dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface. This allows cutting the costs of integration and provides extreme flexibility. With systems integrated using this method, it is possible to completely replace one subsystem with another subsystem which provides similar functionality but exports different interfaces, all this completely transparent for the rest of the subsystems. The only action required is to implement the new interface between the ESB and the new subsystem.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

The horizontal scheme can be misleading, however, if it is thought that the cost of intermediate data transformation or the cost of shifting responsibility over business logic can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Integ"/&gt;

A '''common data format''' is an integration method to avoid every adapter having to [[data conversion|convert data]] to/from every other applications' formats, [[Enterprise application integration]] (EAI) systems usually stipulate an application-independent (or common) data format. The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application's format to the bus's common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).

A '''taijitu''' ({{lang-zh|t=太極圖|s=太极图|p=tàijítú|w=t'ai⁴chi²t'u²}})  is a [[Character (symbol)|symbol or diagram]] ({{lang|zh|图}} ''tú'') in [[Chinese philosophy]] representing [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] ({{lang|zh|太极}} ''tàijí'' "great pole" or "supreme ultimate") representing both its monist (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'') and its dualist ([[yin and yang]]) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.

The modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the "Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the "[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ming period author [[Lai Zhide]] (1525–1604) simplified the ''taijitu'' to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or "Yellow River diagram" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the "Great Monad",&lt;ref&gt;Labelled "The Great Monad" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the "yin-yang symbol" since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.) These dots were believed to be collated with the eight trigrams, and hence with the concepts of roundness and of the heavens, while the equally numinous 'Luo River Writing' was a pattern of dots accosiated with the number nine, with squareness and with the earth."
Craig Clunas, ''Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q06pemllwx0C&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].
&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is {{lang|zh|太极兩儀图}} "two-part Taiji diagram".

[[Unicode]] features the "yin-yang symbol" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ☯). The related "double body symbol" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] block.
The [[Soyombo symbol]], that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the "yin-yang symbol" are found in archaeological artefacts of [[European prehistory]]; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed "yin yang symbols" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Celtic yin yang"&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62–64, 82 (pl.

== Structure ==
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|right|Ming-era Daoist ''Taijitu'']]
The ''taijitu'' consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the "yin and yang symbol", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the "ten thousand things". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  "The ten thousand things are born by transformation" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)

== History ==
{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}
The term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].

=== Song era ===
While the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).&lt;/ref&gt;
the interest in "diagrams" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again
in the Ming period, by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Adler152"&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original description of a ''taijitu'' is due to Song era philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073), author of the ''Taijitu shuo'' {{lang|zh|太極圖說}} "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Taoism with [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions in the ''[[Yijing]]''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] appear in the opening line {{lang|zh|無極而太極}}, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph A. (1999). [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Chou.htm "Zhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and Practice of Sagehood"], in ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', William Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom, eds. 2nd ed., 2 vols. Columbia University Press. pp. 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']], and ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
[[Zhu Xi]] (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.
Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of ''dao''.&lt;ref name="Adler152"/&gt;

While [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram,&lt;ref name="Yao2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=An introduction to Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of "swirling" patterns first appears in the Ming period.

Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the "swirling" variant of the ''taijitu'' in his ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).
The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (''[[bagua]]'') and called the "River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of [[Chinese cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;François Louis,
'The Genesis of an Icon: The "Taiji" Diagram's Early History', ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 63.11 (June 2003),  145–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis (2003) has diagrams with dots dated to 1623 (p. 187) and 1688 (p. 146, p. 190).&lt;/ref&gt; The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. 

Lai Zhide's design is similar to the ''[[Gankyil|gakyil]]'' (''dga' 'khyil'' or "wheel of joy") symbols of [[Tibetan Buddhism]];
but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the [[Three Jewels]] or the [[Four Noble Truths]], i.e. as a [[triskele]] and a [[tetraskelion]] design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer, ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as "yin-yang symbol" in the first half of the 20th century.
The [[flag of South Korea]], originally introduced as the flag of [[Joseon]] era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the [[Bat Quai Do]] used as the Joseon royal standard.

Since the 1960s, "yin-yang symbol" is most widely applied to the ''He tu'' symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.
In the standard form of the contemporary "yin-yang symbol", one draws on the [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the [[radius]] of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an "S", and one erases or obscures the other line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is also described{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}{{year needed|date=December 2015}} "pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other".&lt;ref name="Robinet 2008, 934"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinet|2008|p=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soyombo symbol]] of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a ''Taiji'' symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pu̇revsambuu |first1=G. |title=Mongolia |location=Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia |publisher=[[Montsame]] |year=2006 |isbn=99929-0-627-8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern  symbol has  also been widely used in martial arts, particularly [[t'ai chi ch'uan]] (Taijiquan),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between [[Hard and soft (martial arts)|hard and soft techniques]].

The dots in the modern "yin-yang symbol" have been given the additional interpretation of "intense interaction" between the complementary principles.
&lt;ref&gt;"the yin/yang symbol so familiar to us contains a white dot amid the black and a black dot amid the white to indicate that these principles interact intensely." Norman R. Kraft, ''Ogdoadic Magick'', Weiser Books, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Analysis of Beauty''''' is a book written by the 18th-century artist and writer [[William Hogarth]], published in 1753, which describes Hogarth's theories of visual beauty and grace in a manner accessible to the common man of his day.

==The "Line of Beauty"==

Prominent among Hogarth's ideas of beauty was the theory of the [[Line of Beauty]]; an S-shaped (serpentine) curved line  that excited the attention of the viewer and evoked liveliness and movement. ''The Analysis of Beauty'' formed the intellectual centrepiece of what the historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] described as Hogarth's "grim campaign against fashionable taste",{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which Hogarth himself described as his "War with the Connoisseurs".{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Six principles==

In ''The Analysis of Beauty'' Hogarth implements six principles that independently affect beauty. Although he concurs that those principles have an effect, he is not determinate on their specific influence. The first principle of beauty Hogarth describes is '''fitness''', which is not in itself a source of beauty, but can be described as a material cause of it. Though the account of fitness on the total beauty of an object is only moderate, it is a necessary cause. Fitness does not necessarily imply purpose. However, improperly implied forms cannot be the source of beauty. It is in this that the necessity of fitness must be seen: if not accounted for, a form cannot readily be assumed beautiful.

The second major principle of beauty is '''variety'''. It is the source of beauty, which Hogarth shows us by the contrary notion of "sameness": "sameness", a lack of variety, offends the senses. "The ear is as much offended with one even continued note, as the eye is with being fix'd to a point, or to the view of a dead wall."&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, William, ''The Analysis of Beauty'', Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, our senses find relief in discovering a certain amount of "sameness" within a varietal experience.

The third notion of '''regularity''' is understood as a form of "composed variety": it only pleases us when it is suggestive to fitness. Similar to this notion in effect is '''simplicity''', which enhances the pleasure of variety in that it pleases the eye. The variety which causes a beautiful experience should, so to speak, be tempered by simplicity. On the other hand: simplicity without variety at best does only not displease.

'''Intricacy''' is a strange principle in that it does not directly follow from the formal behaviour of a beautiful object. Hogarth means by this the habit which causes us to end up in the whirling game of pursuit, when bit by bit discovering the beauty of an object. Intricacy arises from the love of this pursuit. Every difficulty in understanding or grasping the object enhances the pleasure of overcoming it, to continue the pursuit. There is a direct connection here to the [[Line of Beauty]] Hogarth dictates, along which every image is built up. Though the movement of our eye is discrete in itself, the movement of our "Mind's eye" follows a duplicate course of the line, a principal ray of light moving along with the line of sight. The continuous movement of our "Mind's eye" triggers the notion of intricacy.

'''Quantity''', finally, is associated with the notion of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], which, when Hogarth's book appeared, was not yet entirely distinguished from the apprehension of beauty. Hogarth thus does not speak of sublimity, but of '''greatness'''. He recognises a great quantity to have an aesthetic effect on the beholder without the necessity of a varietal or fitting form. This should not be exaggerated, as that might lead to absurdities.

'''The Dot ''' is a work of art in [[Emmen (Drenthe)|Emmen]] ([[Netherlands]]). It is designed and painted by art collective the [[toyism|toyists]]. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy.

==History==
Toyist Dejo (founder of [[Toyism]]) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company [[Essent]] (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voormalige_gasbol.jpg|thumb|links|150px|Former gas container]]

==Transformation==
The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub-design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration.

In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called [[Uppspretta]].

'''''The Machine That Changed the World''''' is a 1991 book based on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s $5 million, five-year study on the future of the automobile, written by [[James P. Womack]], [[Daniel T. Jones (scientist)|Daniel T. Jones]], and [[Daniel Roos]]. 
 
This book made the term [[lean production]] known worldwide. It has been translated into eleven languages and has been sold more than 600,000 times. A revised edition was published in 2007.

== The authors ==
[[James P. Womack]] was a highly-regarded professor and authority on systems engineering at [[MIT]]. He went on to become the founder of the Lean Enterprise Institute, Inc. Co-authors of the book, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos have also authored many other well-respected books on lean manufacturing and engineering techniques.

==MIT Book Review==
In his book review, MIT then-student wrote that the history of lean manufacturing began with artisans prior to the industrial revolution when standardized supplies were not yet available to enable large production runs. It wasn't until Henry Ford revolutionized mass production for his automobiles that made it possible for minimally-trained workers to assemble cars quickly and efficiently. Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota modified the process into the first true "lean" method of production. They were able to eliminate much of the waste inherent in Ford's system, making smaller batches of parts to be used as needed as opposed to stocking larger quantities. Toyota also empowered its workers to improve the process and stop the line when issues and errors occurred. This new, lean method required communications to flow in both directions and increased quality while reducing time and costs. The authors, Womack, Jones, and Roos, suggest that lean production can be used outside of automobile manufacturing by adapting its principles to traditional mass production of many kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Urbance|first1=Randy|title=ESD.83 Book Review, The Machine that Changed the World|url=http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/machine.pdf|publisher=MIT|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vacuum airship''', also known as a '''vacuum balloon''', is a hypothetical [[airship]] that is [[Vacuum|evacuated]] rather than filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as hydrogen or helium. First proposed by Italian [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] in 1670,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J. (1631–1687); The Father of Aeronautics | url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/lana.htm | accessdate = 13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vacuum balloon would be the ultimate expression of lifting power per volume displaced.

==History==
From 1886 to 1900 [[Arthur De Bausset]] attempted in vain to raise funds to construct his "vacuum-tube" airship design, but despite early support in the United States Congress, the general public was skeptical. Illinois historian Howard Scamehorn reported that [[Octave Chanute]] and [[Albert Francis Zahm]] "publicly denounced and mathematically proved the fallacy of the vacuum principle", however the author does not give his source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scamehorn|first=Howard Lee|title=Balloons to Jets: A Century of Aeronautics in Illinois, 1855–1955|year=2000|pages=13–14|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bausset published a book on his design&lt;ref name="De Bausset 1887"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = De Bausset | first1 = Arthur | title = Aerial Navigation | publisher = Fergus Printing Co. | year = 1887 | location = Chicago | url = https://archive.org/details/aerialnavigatio00chicgoog | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered $150,000 stock in the Transcontinental Aerial Navigation Company of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aerial Navigation | journal = New York Times | date = February 14, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/02/14/103137015.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = To Navigate the Air | journal = New York Times | date = February 19, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/02/19/103097161.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent application was eventually denied on the basis that it was "wholly theoretical, everything being based upon calculation and nothing upon trial or demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell (Commissioner) | title = Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1890 | publisher = US Government Printing Office | year = 1891 | page = 46 | accessdate = | quote = 50 O.

In 1921, Lavanda Armstrong discloses a composite wall structure with a vacuum chamber "surrounded by a second envelop constructed so as to hold air under pressure, the walls of the envelope being spaced from one another and tied together", including a honeycomb-like cellular structure, however leaving some uncertainty how to achieve adequate buoyancy given "walls may be made as thick and strong as desired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=1390745 |status=patent | inventor= Lavanda M Armstrong | country=US  | title = Aircraft of the lighter-than-air type | pubdate=Sep 13, 1921  |assign1=Lavanda M Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, David Noel discussed the use of geodesic sphere covered with plastic film and "a double balloon containing pressurized air between the
skins, and a vacuum in the centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages=262–266 | journal=Correspondence, Speculations in Science and Technology  | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=1983 | title=Lighter than Air Craft Using Vacuum  | author=David Noel | url=http://aoi.com.au/Originals/VacuumBalloon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  1982–1985 Emmanuel  Bliamptis elaborated on energy sources and use of "inflatable strut rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=4534525 |status=patent | inventor= Emmanuel  Bliamptis | country=US  | title = Evacuated balloon for solar energy collection | pubdate=Aug 13, 1985 |assign1=Emmanuel  Bliamptis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–2007 Akhmeteli and Gavrilin address choice of materials ("beryllium, boron carbide ceramic, and diamond-like carbon" or aluminum) in honeycomb double layer craft to address buckling issues.&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Principle==
An [[airship]] operates on the principle of [[buoyancy]], according to [[Archimedes' principle]]. In an airship, air is the fluid in contrast to a traditional [[ship]] where [[water]] is the fluid.

The [[density of air]] at standard temperature and pressure is 1.28 g/l, so 1 [[liter]] of displaced air has sufficient buoyant force to lift 1.28 g. Airships use a bag to displace a large volume of air; the bag is usually filled with a lightweight gas such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. The total lift generated by an airship is equal to the weight of the air it displaces, minus the weight of the materials used in its construction including the gas used to fill the bag.

Vacuum airships would replace the helium gas with a near-[[vacuum]] environment, having no mass, density would be near to 0.00 g/l, which would theoretically be able to provide the full lift potential of displaced air, so every liter of vacuum could lift 1.28 g. Using the [[molar volume]], the mass of 1 liter of helium (at 1 atmospheres of pressure) is found to be 0.178 g. If helium is used instead of vacuum, the lifting power of every liter is reduced by 0.178 g, so the effective lift is reduced by 14%. A 1-liter volume of hydrogen has a [[mass]] of 0.090 g.

The main problem with the concept of vacuum airships is that, with a near-vacuum inside the airbag, the exterior [[atmospheric pressure]] is not balanced by any internal pressure. This enormous imbalance of forces would cause the airbag to collapse unless it were extremely strong (in an ordinary airship, the force is balanced by helium, making this unnecessary). Thus the difficulty is in constructing an airbag with the additional strength to resist this extreme net force, without weighing the structure down so much that the greater lifting power of vacuum is negated.

==Material constraints==
===Compressive strength===
From the analysis by Akhmeteli and Gavrilin:&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"&gt;{{cite patent | number=2007001053 |status=application | inventor=AM Akhmeteli, AV Gavrilin | country=US  | title =US Patent Application 11/517915. Layered shell vacuum balloons| pubdate=Feb 23, 2006 |pridate=2004-05-13 |assign1=Andrey M Akhmeteli and Andrey V Gavrilin | url=http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/vacuum_balloons_cip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force on a hemi-spherical shell of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by an external pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2 P&lt;/math&gt;. Since the force on each hemisphere has to balance along the equator the compressive stress will be, assuming &lt;math&gt;h&lt;&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi R^2 P / 2 \pi R h = R P / 2 h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the shell thickness.

Neutral buoyancy occurs when the shell has the same mass as the displaced air, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;h/R = \rho_a/(3 \rho_s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is the air density and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the shell density, assumed to be homogeneous. Combining with the stress equation gives 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = (3/2)(\rho_s/\rho_a)P&lt;/math&gt;.
For aluminum and terrestrial conditions Akhmeteli and Gavrilin estimate the stress as &lt;math&gt;3.2\cdot 10^8&lt;/math&gt; Pa, of the same order of magnitude as the compressive strength of aluminum alloys.

===Buckling===
Akhmeteli and Gavrilin note, however, that the compressive strength calculation disregards [[buckling]], and using R. Zoelli's formula for the critical buckling pressure of a sphere
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr} = \frac{2Eh^2}{\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}\frac{1}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[modulus of elasticity]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poisson ratio]] of the shell. Substituting the earlier expression gives a necessary condition for a feasible vacuum balloon shell:
:&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 = \frac{9P_{cr}\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}{2\rho_a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The requirement is about &lt;math&gt;4.5\cdot10^5 kg^{-1} m^5 s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Akhmeteli and Gavrilin assert that this cannot even be achieved using diamond (&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 \approx 1\cdot 10^5&lt;/math&gt;), and 
propose that dropping the assumption that the shell is a homogeneous material may allow lighter and stiffer structures (e.g. a [[honeycomb structure]]).&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Atmospheric constraints==
A vacuum airship should at least float (Archimedes law) and resist external pressure (strength law, depending on design, like the above R. Zoelli's formula for sphere). These two conditions may be rewritten as an inequality where a complex of several physical constants related to the material of the airship is to be lesser than a complex of atmospheric parameters. Thus, for a sphere (hollow sphere and, to a lesser extent, cylinder are practically the only designs for which a strength law is known) it is &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} &lt; \sqrt{1-\frac{P_{\rm int}}{P}}\cdot L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm int}&lt;/math&gt; is pressure within the sphere, while &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana coefficient») and &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana atmospheric  ratio») are:&lt;ref name=shikhovtsev16&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mir.k156.ru/aeroplan/de_bausset_aeroplane-03-1.html#a03-1-2016 |title=Is FLanar Possible? | author=E. Shikhovtsev | date=2016 | accessdate=2016-06-19 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} = 2.79\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}} \cdot (1-\mu^2)^{0.25}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} \approx 2.71\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}}&lt;/math&gt; with an error of order of 3% or less);
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}} \cdot \frac{M_a}{T_a}&lt;/math&gt;),
where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm atm} = 101325&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Pa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm atm} = 1.22&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;kg/m^3&lt;/math&gt; are pressure and density of standard Earth atmosphere at sea level, &lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; are molar mass (kg/kmol) and temperature (K) of atmosphere at floating area.
Of all known planets and moons of the Sun system only the Venusian atmosphere has &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; big enough to surpass &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; for such materials as some composites (below altitude of ca. 15&amp;nbsp;km) and graphene (below altitude of ca. 40&amp;nbsp;km). Both materials may survive in the Venusian atmosphere. The equation for &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; shows that exoplanets with dense, cold and high-molecular (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; type) atmospheres may be suitable for vacuum airships, but it is a rare type of atmosphere.

==In fiction==
In the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] novel ''[[Tarzan at the Earth's Core]]'' [[Tarzan]] travels to [[Pellucidar]] in a vacuum airship constructed of the fictional material Harbenite.

In ''Passarola Rising'', novelist [[Azhar Abidi]] imagines what might have happened had [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] built and flown a vacuum airship.

Spherical vacuum body airships using the [[Magnus effect]] and made of [[carbyne]] or similar superhard carbon are glimpsed in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''.

In ''Maelstrom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rifters.com/real/MAELSTROM.htm|title=Maelstrom by Peter Watts|first=Peter|last=Watts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth:B-Max'', author [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]] describes various flying devices, such as "botflies" and "lifters" that use "vacuum bladders" to keep them airborne.

In ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]], a vacuum balloon is used by the narrative character Bascule in his quest to rescue Ergates. Vacuum dirigibles (airships) are also mentioned as a notable engineering feature of the space-faring utopian civilisation [[The Culture]] in Banks' novel ''[[Look to Windward]]''&lt;!-- At the end of Chapter 4, Scorched Ground, dialogue between Zleper and 947 Praf. --&gt;, and the vast vacuum dirigible Equatorial 353 is a pivotal location in the final Culture novel, ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.

The '''Waste Minimisation Act''' is an Act of Parliament passed in [[New Zealand]] in 2008.

It was a Private Members Bill introduced by [[Mike Ward (New Zealand politician)|Mike Ward]]. The major provisions of the Act are: a levy on landfill waste, promoting [[product stewardship]] schemes, some mandatory waste reporting, clarifying the role of territorial authorities with respect to waste minimisation, and sets up a Waste Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/waste-minimisation.html|title=The Waste Minimisation Act 2008|date=2009-03-22|publisher=Ministry for the Environment|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act has a provision where the Minister for the Environment can assign the status of [[priority product]], which are those that can cause a high degree of environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2008/0089/latest/DLM1154572.html#DLM1154572|title=Waste Minimisation Act 2008 - Declaration of priority products|date=25 September 2008|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water quality''' refers to the [[Chemical property|chemical]], [[Physical property|physical]], [[Biology|biological]], and [[radiological]] characteristics of [[water]].&lt;ref name="water quality"&gt;Diersing, Nancy (2009). [http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqfaq.pdf "Water Quality: Frequently Asked Questions."] Florida Brooks National Marine Sanctuary, Key  West, FL.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a measure of the condition of water relative to the requirements of one or more biotic species and or to any human need or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson (1997). "Meanings of environmental terms." ''Journal of Environmental Quality.'' 26: 581–589. {{doi|10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600030002x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which compliance, generally achieved through [[Water treatment|treatment]] of the water, can be assessed. The most common standards used to assess water quality relate to health of [[ecosystems]], [[safety]] of human contact, and [[drinking water]].

== Standards ==
In the setting of standards, agencies make political and technical/scientific decisions about how the water will be used.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/standards-water-body-health |title=What are Water Quality Standards? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-03-17 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of natural [[Body of water|water bodies]], they also make some reasonable estimate of pristine conditions. Natural water bodies will vary in response to environmental conditions. [[Environmental science|Environmental scientists]] work  to understand how these systems function, which in turn helps to identify the sources and fates of [[contaminant]]s. [[Environmental lawyers]] and [[policy]]makers work to define [[legislation]] with the intention that water is maintained at an appropriate quality for its identified use.

The vast majority of [[surface water]] on the [[Earth]] is neither [[potable]] nor [[toxicity|toxic]]. This remains true when [[seawater]] in the [[ocean]]s (which is too [[Salinity|salty]] to drink) is not counted. Another general perception of water quality is that of a simple property that tells whether water is [[pollution|polluted]] or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the [[ecology]] of the Earth. [[Industry|Industrial]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] activities (e.g. [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[construction]], [[transport]]) are a major cause of [[water pollution]] as are [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[farm|agricultural]] areas, [[urban runoff]] and discharge of treated and untreated [[sewage]].

==Categories==
The parameters for water quality are determined by the intended use. Work in the area of water quality tends to be focused on water that is [[Water treatment|treated]] for human consumption, industrial use, or in the environment.

===Human consumption===
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Contaminants that may be in untreated water include [[microorganism]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]]; [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] contaminants such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[metals]]; [[Organic compound|organic chemical]] contaminants from industrial processes and [[petroleum]] use; [[pesticides]] and [[herbicides]]; and [[radioactive]] contaminants. Water quality depends on the local [[geology]] and [[ecosystem]], as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies as a [[heat sink]], and overuse (which may lower the level of the water).

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) limits the amounts of certain contaminants in [[tap water]] provided by US [[public water system]]s. The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] authorizes EPA to issue two types of standards:
* ''primary standards'' regulate substances that potentially affect human health;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "National Primary Drinking Water Regulations." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA DW reqts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulations |title=Drinking Water Regulations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-09-01 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''secondary standards'' prescribe aesthetic qualities, those that affect taste, odor, or appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/secondary-drinking-water-standards-guidance-nuisance-chemicals |title=Secondary Drinking Water Standards: Guidance for Nuisance Chemicals |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-08 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in [[bottled water]] that must provide the same protection for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/BuyStoreServeSafeFood/ucm046894.htm |title=FDA Regulates the Safety of Bottled Water Beverages Including Flavored Water and Nutrient-Added Water Beverages |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-09-22 |website=Food Facts for Consumers |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |location=Silver Spring, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk.

In [[urbanization|urbanized]] areas around the world, [[water purification]] technology is used in municipal water systems to remove contaminants from the source water (surface water or [[groundwater]]) before it is distributed to homes, businesses, schools and other recipients. Water drawn directly from a stream, lake, or [[aquifer]] and that has no treatment will be of uncertain quality.

===Industrial and domestic use===
[[Solvation|Dissolved]] minerals may affect suitability of water for a range of industrial and domestic purposes. The most familiar of these is probably the presence of [[ion]]s of [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) which interfere with the cleaning action of [[soap]], and can form hard [[sulfate]] and soft [[carbonate]] [[Precipitation|deposits]] in water [[heater]]s or [[boiler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Babbitt, Harold E. &amp; Doland, James J. ''Water Supply Engineering'' (1949) '''ASIN:''' B000OORYE2; McGraw-Hill p.388&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard water may be softened to remove these ions. The softening process often substitutes [[sodium]] cations.&lt;ref&gt;Linsley, Ray K. &amp; Franzini, Joseph B. ''Water-Resources Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-037959-9}} pp.454–456&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard water may be preferable to soft water for human consumption, since health problems have been associated with excess sodium and with calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Softening decreases nutrition and may increase cleaning effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2004).

===Environmental water quality===
[[File:View of urban runoff discharging to coastal waters.jpg|right|200px|thumb|upright|[[Urban runoff]] discharging to coastal waters]]
{{See also|Environmental monitoring|Freshwater environmental quality parameters}}

'''Environmental water quality''', also called '''ambient water quality,''' relates to water bodies such as [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, and [[ocean]]s. Water quality standards for surface waters vary significantly due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances and high populations of certain [[microorganism]]s can present a health hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming, fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions may also affect wildlife, which use the water for drinking or as a habitat. Modern water quality laws generally specify protection of fisheries and recreational use and require, as a minimum, retention of current quality standards.
[[File:Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water. Wellcome V0011218.jpg|thumb|left|Satirical cartoon by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], showing a woman observing monsters in a drop of London water (at the time of the ''Commission on the London Water Supply'' report, 1828)]]
There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental laws focus on the designation of particular uses of a water body. In some countries these designations allow for some [[water contamination]] as long as the particular type of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the landscape changes (e.g., [[land development]], [[urbanization]], [[clearcutting]] in forested areas) in the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of many freshwater bodies, returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge. In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals for maintaining healthy ecosystems and may concentrate on the protection of populations of [[endangered species]] and protecting human health.

==Sampling and measurement==
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|analytical chemistry|water sampling stations}}
The complexity of water quality as a subject is reflected in the many types of measurements of water quality indicators. The most accurate measurements of water quality are made on-site, because water exists in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with its [[Environment (systems)|surroundings]]. Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], [[Reduction potential|oxygen reduction potential (ORP)]], [[turbidity]], and [[Secchi disk]] depth.

===Sample collection===
{{also|Environmental monitoring#Sampling methods}}
[[File:WQ sampling station USGS 2004.jpg|thumb|An automated sampling station installed along the East Branch [[Milwaukee River]], [[New Fane, Wisconsin]]. The cover of the 24-bottle autosampler (center) is partially raised, showing the sample bottles inside. The autosampler was programmed to collect samples at time intervals, or proportionate to flow over a specified period. The data logger (white cabinet) recorded temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen levels.]]
More complex measurements are often made in a [[laboratory]] requiring a water [[Sample (material)|sample]] to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed at another location. The process of water sampling introduces two significant problems:
* The first problem is the extent to which the sample may be representative of the water source of interest. Many water sources vary with time and with location. The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Iys5rnwkWYC Limnology]'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and underlying or confining [[soil]]. The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by [[average]]d values with time and location, or if critical [[maxima and minima]] require individual measurements over a range of times, locations or events. The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual sampling times and locations where averaging is appropriate.&lt;ref name="Franson"&gt;Franson, Mary Ann (1975). ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000494277 Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater]'' 14th ed. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association &amp; Water Pollution Control Federation. {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, [[statistics|statistical methods]] must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess [[probability]] of exceeding those critical values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1973 |title=Handbook for Monitoring Industrial Wastewater |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20008SJY.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 8. Data Analysis |id=EPA 625/6-73/002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second problem occurs as the sample is removed from the water source and begins to establish [[chemical equilibrium]] with its new surroundings – the sample container. Sample containers must be made of [[material]]s with minimal [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may [[sorption|sorb]] onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis.&lt;ref name="Franson" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any [[pump]]s, [[piping]], or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced [[pressure]] of the atmosphere; so gas [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water may escape into unfilled space at the top of the container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other [[Chemical equilibrium|chemical reaction equilibria]] may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly [[suspended solids|suspended]] by water [[turbulence]] may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid [[Phase (matter)|phase]] may form from biological growth or [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]]. [[Microorganism]]s within the water sample may biochemically alter [[concentration]]s of [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[organic compound]]s. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter [[pH]] and change [[solubility]] of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:watersampling.JPG|thumb|right|Filtering a manually collected water sample ([[Environmental monitoring#Grab samples|grab sample]]) for analysis]]
Sample preservation may partially resolve the second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold to slow the [[reaction rate|rate of chemical reactions]] and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them.&lt;ref name="Franson" /&gt;{{rp|43–45}} A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples in advance of the sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a "blank", is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest.  The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then "spiked" with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and spiked samples are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (2009).

===Testing in response to natural disasters and other emergencies===
Inevitably after events such as [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s, there is an immediate response by the aid agencies as relief operations get underway to try and restore basic infrastructure and provide the basic fundamental items that are necessary for survival and subsequent recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/tsunamis/waterquality.html|title=Water Quality After a Tsunami|last=Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to clean drinking water and adequate [[sanitation]] is a priority at times like this. The threat of [[disease]] increases hugely due to the large numbers of people living close together, often in squalid conditions, and without proper sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furusawa|first=Takuro|last2=Maki|first2=Norio|last3=Suzuki|first3=Shingo|date=2008-01-01|title=Bacterial contamination of drinking water and nutritional quality of diet in the areas of the western Solomon Islands devastated by the April 2, 2007 earthquake⁄tsunami|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tmh/36/2/36_2007-63/_article|journal=Tropical Medicine and Health|volume=36|issue=2|pages=65–74|doi=10.2149/tmh.2007-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[natural disaster]], as far as water quality testing is concerned there are widespread views on the best course of action to take and a variety of methods can be employed. The key basic water quality parameters that need to be addressed in an emergency are bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, free [[chlorine]] residual, [[pH]], [[turbidity]] and possibly [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]/[[total dissolved solids]]. There are a number of portable water test kits on the market widely used by aid and relief agencies for carrying out such testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=Dorian A.

After major natural disasters, a considerable length of time might pass before water quality returns to pre-disaster levels. For example, following the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] the Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI) monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.&lt;ref&gt;International Water Management Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka (2010). [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf "Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami."] ''Success Stories.'' Issue 7. {{doi|10.5337/2011.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt; IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]] as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2011). [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/envsan/technotes/en/ "WHO technical notes for emergencies."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212053301/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/envsan/technotes/en/ |date=12 February 2016 }} Water Engineering Development Centre, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical analysis===
[[File:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatograph-&lt;br/&gt;mass spectrometer]] measures [[pesticide]]s and other [[Organic compound|organic]] pollutants]]
The simplest methods of [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] are those measuring [[chemical element]]s without respect to their form. Elemental analysis for [[oxygen]], as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890 g/L ([[grams]] per [[litre]]) of water sample because oxygen (O) has 89% mass of the water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The method selected to measure [[dissolved oxygen]] should differentiate between [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced a large amount of sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not [[solvation|dissolved]] in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding [[acid]] to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles. [[Filtration]] of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter.&lt;ref&gt;State of California Environmental Protection Agency ''Representative Sampling of Ground Water for Hazardous Substances'' (1994) pp.23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The complexities of differentiating similar [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]] are even more challenging.
[[File:PSA 2.jpg|thumb|[[Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy]] is used to measure [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and other heavy metals]]
Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted by [[Government agency|government agencies]]. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a local government-sponsored volunteer monitoring program: {{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/streams/monitoring.html |title=Monitoring Our Waters |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Watershed Restoration |publisher=Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection |location=Rockville, Maryland |access-date=2018-11-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home [[Aquarium|fish tanks]], and biological assessment procedures.

===Real-time monitoring===
Although water quality is usually sampled and analyzed at laboratories, nowadays, citizens demand real-time information about the water they are drinking. During the last years, several companies are deploying worldwide real-time remote monitoring systems for measuring water pH, turbidity or dissolved oxygen levels.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Drinking water indicators===
[[File:Electrical conductivity meter.jpg|thumb|right|An [[electrical conductivity meter]] is used to measure [[total dissolved solids]]]]
The following is a list of indicators often measured by situational category:
* [[Alkalinity]]
* [[Color of water]]
* [[pH]]
* Taste and odor ([[geosmin]], [[2-Methylisoborneol]] (MIB), etc.)
* Dissolved metals and salts ([[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]])
* Microorganisms such as [[fecal coliform]] bacteria (''Escherichia coli''), [[Cryptosporidium]], and [[Giardia lamblia]]; ''see'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]]
* Dissolved metals and metalloids ([[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], etc.)
* Dissolved organics: [[colored dissolved organic matter]] (CDOM), [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC)
* [[Radon]]
* [[Heavy metals]]
* [[Pharmaceutical]]s

[[Biological indicator|Biological monitoring]] metrics have been developed in many places, and one widely used measure is the presence and abundance of members of the insect orders [[Ephemeroptera]], [[Plecoptera]] and [[Trichoptera]] (common names are, respectively, mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly). EPT indexes will naturally vary from region to region, but generally, within a region, the greater the number of taxa from these orders, the better the water quality. Organisations in the United States, such as EPA. offer guidance on developing a monitoring program and identifying members of these and other aquatic insect orders. Many US wastewater dischargers (e.g., factories, power plants, [[refineries]], mines, municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants) are required to conduct periodic '''whole effluent toxicity''' (WET) tests.&lt;ref name="WET-methods"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/whole-effluent-toxicity-methods |title=Whole Effluent Toxicity Methods |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-04-19 |website=Clean Water Act Analytical Methods |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2002 |title=Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/acute-toxicity-wet-methods |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-02-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals interested in monitoring water quality who cannot afford or manage lab scale analysis can also use biological indicators to get a general reading of water quality. One example is the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program of [[Iowa]], which includes a [[benthic]] [[macroinvertebrate]] indicator key.&lt;ref&gt;IOWATER (Iowa Department of Natural Resources). Iowa City, IA (2005). [http://www.iowater.net/Publications/BMIKey2Edvmay05.pdf "Benthic Macroinvertebrate Key."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bivalve molluscs are largely used as [[bioindicators]] to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both  fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. A typical project is the U.S. [[Mussel Watch Program]]me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/musselwatch.aspx |title=Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment: Mussel Watch Contaminant Monitoring |publisher=Ccma.nos.noaa.gov |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2015-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907012135/http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/musselwatch.aspx |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today they are used worldwide.

The Southern African Scoring System (SASS) method is a biological water quality monitoring system based on the presence of benthic macroinvertebrates. The SASS [[aquatic biomonitoring]] tool has been refined over the past 30 years and is now on the fifth version (SASS5) which has been specifically modified in accordance with international standards, namely the [[ISO/IEC 17025]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens CWS and Graham PM. 2002.

* The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has published guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for drinking-water quality, fourth edition|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/2011/dwq_guidelines/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published {{when|date=June 2016}} regulation of water quality in the section of ICS 13.060,&lt;ref name=13wq&gt;{{cite web  | last = International Organization for Standardization (ISO) | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = 13.060: Water quality  | location = Geneva, Switzerland  | date =  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_ics_browse.htm?ICS1=13&amp;ICS2=060 | doi = | accessdate = 2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from water sampling, drinking water, industrial class water, sewage, and examination of water for chemical, physical or biological properties.

====European Union====
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in the European Union}}
The water policy of the [[European Union]] is primarily codified in three [[European Union directive|directives]]:
*[[Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment]] (91/271/EEC) of 21 May 1991 concerning discharges of municipal and some industrial [[wastewater]]s;
*[[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union#Drinking water directive of 1998|The Drinking Water Directive]] (98/83/EC) of 3 November 1998 concerning potable water quality;
*[[Water Framework Directive]] (2000/60/EC) of 23 October 2000 concerning [[water resources]] management.

====India====
* [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) Standards for Drinking Water.

====South Africa====
{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
Water quality guidelines for South Africa are grouped according to potential user types (e.g. domestic, industrial) in the 1996 Water Quality Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Republic of South Africa, Department of Water Affairs, Pretoria (1996). [http://www.dwaf.gov.za/IWQS/wq_guide/index.html "Water quality guidelines for South Africa: First Edition 1996."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Drinking water quality is subject to the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specification.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson K, Manus L. A drinking water quality framework for South Africa. Water SA. 2006;32(5):673–678 [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/viewFile/47853/34223].&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In England and Wales acceptable levels for drinking water supply are listed in the "Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, London, UK. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3184/contents/made "The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000."] 2000 No. 3184. 2000-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the United States, [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|Water Quality Standards]] are defined by state agencies for various water bodies, guided by the desired uses for the water body (e.g., fish habitat, drinking water supply, recreational use).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303, {{USC|33|1313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires each governing jurisdiction (states, territories, and covered tribal entities) to submit a set of biennial reports on the quality of water in their area. These reports are known as the 303(d) and 305(b) reports, named for their respective CWA provisions, and are submitted to, and approved by, EPA.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 303(d), {{USC|33|1313}}; Section 305(b), {{USC|33|1315(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These reports are completed by the governing jurisdiction, typically a [[:Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States|state environmental agency]]. EPA recommends that each state submit a single "Integrated Report" comprising its list of impaired waters and the status of all water bodies in the state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-303d-listing |title=Program Overview: 303(d) Listing |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-10-24 |website=Impaired Waters and TMDLs |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress'' is a general report on water quality, providing overall information about the number of miles of streams and rivers and their aggregate condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |title=National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-18 |website=Water Data and Tools |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA requires states to adopt standards for each of the possible designated uses that they assign to their waters. Should evidence suggest or document that a stream, river or lake has failed to meet the water quality criteria for one or more of its designated uses, it is placed on a list of impaired waters. Once a state has placed a water body on this list, it must develop a management plan establishing [[Total Maximum Daily Load]]s (TMDLs) for the pollutant(s) impairing the use of the water. These TMDLs establish the reductions needed to fully support the designated uses.&lt;ref&gt;More information about water quality in the United States is available on EPA's [https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/surf-your-watershed "Surf Your Watershed"] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking water standards, which are applicable to [[public water system]]s, are issued by EPA under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref name="EPA DW reqts"/&gt;

'''Wilma Subra''' (born 1943) is an American environmental scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Cohen. [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/21/news/mn-59858 "Genial Grandmother Is 'Top Gun' in Environmental Activism"], Associated Press, October 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; She is President of the Subra Company, an environmental consulting firm.&lt;ref name=epabio&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ej/conference2007/Wilma_Subra_Bio.pdf "Biography of Wilma Subra"], Environmental Protection Agency, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subra was born in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], and was raised there and in nearby [[Bayou Vista, Louisiana|Bayou Vista]]. Her father was a chemist, and her grandfather an oyster fisherman. She obtained a bachelor's degree in microbiology and chemistry in 1965 from the [[University of Southwestern Louisiana]] in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], and her master's a year later.&lt;ref name=Frankland2013p167&gt;Peggy Frankland, ''Women Pioneers of the Louisiana Environmental Movement'', University Press of Mississippi, 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hYj9I3zuZ_QC&amp;pg=PA167 p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967 until 1981 Sabra worked for the Gulf South Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara L. Allen,  ''Uneasy Alchemy: Citizens and Experts in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor Disputes'', MIT Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VIZDtZnEQ5sC&amp;pg=PA124 p. 124].&lt;/ref&gt; She founded the Subra Company in May 1981 to help people facing problems because of [[environmental health]] issues.&lt;ref name=Frankland2013p167/&gt;

Subra served for seven years as vice-chair of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology, for six years on the EPA's National
Environmental Justice Advisory Council, and for five years on the National Advisory Committee of the US Representative to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation.&lt;ref name=epabio/&gt; She appeared in the 2010 documentary [[Gasland]].
