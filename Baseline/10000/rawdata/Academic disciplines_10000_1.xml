'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; architect active in the [[Venetian Republic]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed together as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called "Della Gondola", was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who was the sculptor responsible for the altar in the Church of Santa Maria dei Carmini in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moose|first1=editor, Christina J.|title=Great lives from history.|date=2005|publisher=Salem Press|location=Pasadena, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavazza da Sossano is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture", [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123603460173214171?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mostra del Palladio: Vicenza / Basilica Palladiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUk3AQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Electa|page=46|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] {{ISBN|0-262-70054-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924065640/http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e |date=24 September 2009 }}, [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name="Avcioglu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in Europe.

[[File:Monument to Andrea Palladio (Vicenza).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Palladio in Vicenza]]
Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini "Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517124924/http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Dawes]] much admired that style of architecture, and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the "Father of American Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm|title=The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'|website=www.marcadoc.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192605/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192618/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710002925/http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

== Models ==
The [[Daisyworld]] computer simulation from 1983, calculated how [[Earth's radiation balance|radiant energy]] increased or decreased, dependent on the [[albedo]] effect, based on changes in the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Andrew J. |author2=G.J.

The Simple Biosphere (SiB) model, presented by Sellers et al. in 1986, calculates transfer of energy, mass and momentum of the atmosphere and the vegetated surface of the Earth. The model is designed for use in atmospheric ''general circulation models'', to account for the related climate attribution of the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sellers|year=1986|title=A simple biosphere model (SiB) for use within general circulation models|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|issue=43|pages=505–531|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1986)043&lt;0505:ASBMFU&gt;2.0.CO;2|volume=43|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(1986)043%3C0505%3AASBMFU%3E2.0.CO%3B2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version was published in 1996 and incorporates satellite measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sellers|year=1996|title=A Revised Land Surface Parameterization (SiB2) for Atmospheric GCMS.

Before placentation takes place, CDX4 plays a role in its development.  CDX4 mutants are born healthy and are fertile, however its importance is revealed in compound CDX mutants.  Compound mutants carrying one CDX2 null allele and homozygous null for CDX4 fail to generate posterior tissue caudal to the hindlimbs and most of these embryos die around embryonic day 10.5 from lack of placental development. Around 10% of this phenotype may progress to full term, but then die shortly after birth.  Upon inspection the morphogenesis of ano-rectal and urethral tissues was observed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nes|first1=Johan van|last2=Graaff|first2=Wim de|last3=Lebrin|first3=Franck|last4=Gerhard|first4=Markus|last5=Beck|first5=Felix|last6=Deschamps|first6=Jacqueline|title=The Cdx4 mutation affects axial development and reveals an essential role of Cdx genes in the ontogenesis of the placental labyrinth in mice|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/133/3/419|website=Development|pages=419–428|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.02216|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ven|first1=Cesca van de|last2=Bialecka|first2=Monika|last3=Neijts|first3=Roel|last4=Young|first4=Teddy|last5=Rowland|first5=Jennifer E.|last6=Stringer|first6=Emma J.|last7=Rooijen|first7=Carina Van|last8=Meijlink|first8=Frits|last9=Nóvoa|first9=Ana|last10=Freund|first10=Jean-Noel|last11=Mallo|first11=Moises|last12=Beck|first12=Felix|last13=Deschamps|first13=Jacqueline|title=Concerted involvement of Cdx/Hox genes and Wnt signaling in morphogenesis of the caudal neural tube and cloacal derivatives from the posterior growth zone|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/16/3451.long|website=Development|pages=3451–3462|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.066118|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well described function of CDX genes are their role in caudal body formation.  Transcription factors of the CDX gene family, in part control Hox gene expression by responding to signaling molecules Retinoic Acid, Wnt, and FGF.  The redundant contribution of CDX4 in axial elongation is shown in that neither CDX4 null or CDX1/CDX4 compound mutants appear with impaired axial elongation.  However, CDX4 does have a role in determining pancreatic B-cell number, specifying anterior-posterior location of the foregut organs including the pancreas and liver.  Thus, an abnormal state is shown in embryos deficient in CDX4 by posteriorly shifted pancreas, liver and small intestines. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ven|first1=Cesca van de|last2=Bialecka|first2=Monika|last3=Neijts|first3=Roel|last4=Young|first4=Teddy|last5=Rowland|first5=Jennifer E.|last6=Stringer|first6=Emma J.|last7=Rooijen|first7=Carina Van|last8=Meijlink|first8=Frits|last9=Nóvoa|first9=Ana|last10=Freund|first10=Jean-Noel|last11=Mallo|first11=Moises|last12=Beck|first12=Felix|last13=Deschamps|first13=Jacqueline|title=Concerted involvement of Cdx/Hox genes and Wnt signaling in morphogenesis of the caudal neural tube and cloacal derivatives from the posterior growth zone|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/16/3451.long|website=Development|pages=3451–3462|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.066118|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kinkel|first1=Mary D.|last2=Eames|first2=Stefani C.|last3=Alonzo|first3=Martha R.|last4=Prince|first4=Victoria E.|title=Cdx4 is required in the endoderm to localize the pancreas and limitβ -cell number|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/135/5/919|website=Development|pages=919–929|language=en|doi=10.1242/dev.010660|date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In blood formation, CDX4 regulation of Hox genes is necessary for the specification of hematopoietic cell fate during embryogenesis.  This is demonstrated by the fact that blood deficiencies in CDX4 mutants can be rescued by the over expression of certain Hox genes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Alan J.|last2=Ernst|first2=Patricia|last3=Wang|first3=Yuan|last4=Dekens|first4=Marcus P.

Knockout models have been generated in mice as described in CDX4’s role in caudal body formation.

A '''cleaning station''' is a location where aquatic life congregate to be cleaned by smaller creatures. Such stations exist in both freshwater and marine environments, and are used by animals including [[fish]], [[sea turtle]]s and [[hippo]]s.&lt;ref name="Hroch 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hroch|first1=Tomas|title=Mzima Springs - Haunt of the hippo|url=http://eng.hrosi.org/?id=34|website=eng.hrosi.org|accessdate=27 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112224209/http://eng.hrosi.org/?id=34|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cleaning process includes the removal of [[parasite]]s from the animal's body (both externally and internally), and is performed by various smaller animals including  [[cleaner shrimp]] and numerous species of [[cleaner fish]], especially [[wrasse]]s and [[goby|gobies]] ([[Elacatinus]] ''spp''.).

When the animal approaches a cleaning station, it will open its mouth wide or position its body in such a way as to signal that it needs cleaning. The cleaner fish will then remove and eat the parasites from the skin, even swimming into the mouth and [[gill]]s of any fish being cleaned. This is a form of [[cleaning symbiosis]].

Cleaning stations may be associated with [[coral]] reefs, located either on top of a coral head or in a slot between two outcroppings. Other cleaning stations may be located under large clumps of floating seaweed or at an accepted point in a river or lagoon.

Some species of [[combtooth blenny]], most notably the [[false cleanerfish]], mimic the appearance and behaviour of cleaners, then tear away scales or flesh when suitably close to the victim.

'''''Climate Research''''' is a small [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the Inter-Research Science Center that was established in 1990. Its founder and long time publisher was marine biologist [[Otto Kinne]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.int-res.com/journals/cr/about-the-journal/ |title=Inter Research » Journals » CR » Information |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the climate research community, the journal is mostly known for its 2003 publication of a controversial and now discredited climate change article.

Three volumes, each typically containing half a dozen articles, are published each year. Each of its 12 editors therefore handles an average of less than 2 articles a year. ''Climate Research'' covers all aspects of the interactions of climate with organisms, [[ecosystem]]s, and human societies. In 2006, a special issue of the journal, titled "Advances in Applying Climate Prediction to Agriculture", was published under [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://start.org/programs/climag|title=Climate Prediction and Agriculture (CLIMAG)|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v33/n1/|title=CR - Vol. 33, No. 1 - Table of contents|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photo- Kevin Evans (10722189116).jpg|thumb|Volunteers sort and catalog a library collection at the [[National Library of Cambodia]]. Creating documentation of collections and providing safe storage conditions are important aspects of collections management.]]

'''Collections management''' involves the development, storage, and preservation of [[collection (artwork)|collections]] and [[cultural heritage]]. The primary goal of collections management is to meet the needs of the individual collector or collecting institution's [[mission statement]], while also ensuring the long-term safety and sustainability of the cultural objects within the collector's care. Collections management, which consists primarily of the administrative responsibilities associated with collection development, is closely related to [[collections care]], which is the physical preservation of cultural heritage. The professions most influenced by collections management include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.

==Definition==
Cultural heritage collections require a great deal of care and protection in order to ensure their safety from external loss or damage, but they also require in-depth documentation to assist in tracking the life of the object within the holding institution. To accommodate these needs, collectors adhere to collections management and collections care standards and practices, which serve to create a safe environment for collection objects with clear and precise accompanying documentation. Where collections care addresses the physical actions necessary to prevent or delay damages of cultural heritage, collection management can be defined as "a process of information gathering, communication, coordination, policy formulation, evaluation, and planning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Johnson|first =Peggy|title =Fundamentals of Collection Development and Management|place =Chicago, IL|publisher =The American Library Association|year =2009|edition =2|chapter =1: Introduction to Collection Management and Development|page =2| isbn =978-0-8389-0972-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes influence decisions about records management and the collections management policy, which outlines protocols for the collection scope, collections care, and emergency planning and response.

==Records management==
According to the Smithsonian Institution, a record is "any official, recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristics which are created, received, and maintained" by an individual collector or institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Smithsonian Institution Archives|author-link=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Records Management|year =n.d.|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/services/records-management|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As every object within a collection must have accompanying documentation, records management functions as the primary focus of collections management, and covers a wide range of documentation and policy standards. Topics covered under the umbrella of records management include collection information management systems, collections accession and deaccession policies, collection management policies, cataloging, and curation. The lack of appropriate record keeping systems in museums compromises the security of museum collections and threatens the role of museums as information centers. Planned and systematized management of records improves programs and activities in museums, thereby leading to effective governance and operation of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Chaterera|author-link=Journal of the South African Society of Archivists|title=Beyond regress: museum records management in Zimbabwe|year =2014|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/services/records-management|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections management systems===
{{Main|Collections Management System}}
Collection management systems (CMS) are software programs designed to aid in the archiving and cataloging of objects in a collection. Within libraries, archives, and museums there are several CMS systems available for use to include: are [http://alm.axiell.com/collections-management-software/ Axiell's Collections Management Software], Proficio by Re:discovery Software, [http://www.zetcom.com/en/museumplus_en/ MuseumPlus] by zetcom, The Museum System (TMS), S-MUSEUM by SKINsoft, EmbARK, Archivists Toolkit, and PastPerfect, just to name a few. Some institutions even create their own "homegrown" CMS, using common development tools such as [[Filemaker|Filemaker Pro]], and [[Microsoft Access|Microsoft Office Access]], to address the specific needs of their collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Re:discovery Software|title=Collection Management Systems for all collections big and small|year =n.d. |url=http://www.rediscoverysoftware.com/productsoverview.aspx|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Gallery Systems|title=Collection Management: Software for Museums, Visual Resources and Cultural Collections|year =n.d. |url=http://www.gallerysystems.com/collection-management-software-museums-visual-resources-and-cultural-collections|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Oral History in the Digital Age|title=Collection Management Systems: Tools for Managing Oral History Collections|year =2014 |url=http://ohda.matrix.msu.edu/2012/06/collection-management-systems/|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors to consider in selecting a CMS including the size of the collection, its anticipated growth over time, and the availability of IT resources and staffing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Z. (Jan-Feb 2013), "[http://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?]", History Associates, retrieved 17 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although every CMS program is unique, there are several features that are considered standard:

* ''Cataloging'': This feature includes fields for object identification purposes such as permanent identification numbers, object name, artist or creator name, object description, dimensions, object components and materials, condition, provenance, exhibition and preservation history, current location, and an image of the object.
* ''Acquisitions'': This feature includes fields relevant to the donor and purchase history for the object such as date of acquisition, donor or seller name and contact information, the assigned [[accession number (library science)|accession number]], purchase price, condition assessment at time of arrival, and seller or donor restrictions, if applicable.
* ''Deaccessions'': This feature addresses the removal of an object from a collection and includes information such as the date of deacessioning, method of disposal used, and reason for removal.
* ''Loans'': This feature is used for tracking information about incoming and outgoing loans to include lender name and contact information, special requirements, shipping instructions, associated insurance policies, and loan history.
* ''Condition and conservation reports'': This feature includes condition assessments performed on objects, and the name of the inspector and date of inspection. This section also includes conservation reports detailing [[conservation-restoration]] treatments performed on the object.
* ''Security'': This feature allows the database administrator to restrict access to the database by giving only specific individuals access to view and/or edit object records.
* ''Copyright'': The copyright feature allows the institution to input relevant intellectual property restrictions for the objects in order to prevent illegal distribution or reproduction of the object.
* ''Multimedia'': The multimedia feature is a function that allows digital materials such as image, video, and audio content associated with an object to be attached to the object record. This feature typically allows the input of associated [[metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Carpinone|first =Elana C.|title =Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All|date =May 2010|pages =25–27| url=http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf| accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cataloging===
{{Main|Cataloging}}
Cataloging is the process of entering informational data about an object into a [[collection catalog]] or database. This process involves assigning unique identification numbers to individual objects within a collection, and attaching relevant accompanying documentation to the item such as curatorial worksheets, photographs, condition assessments, and accession and/or deaccession information.&lt;ref name= "AMNH"&gt;{{Citation|last =American Museum of Natural History|author-link=American History Museum|title= Cataloging|year =n.d. |url=http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/11/cataloging|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A catalog is meant to serve as a systematic written or digital record of every object within a collection, and should at the very least, include an object description that will allow for easy identification of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =1A: History of Registration|page =2| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cataloging is an important aspect of collections management as it provides the individual records associated with each object within a collection. Should an object be lost or destroyed, the catalog entry can be utilized as a permanent record of the object and its data. For some collections, such as natural history collections, the catalog entry for an object or specimen also contains the scientific values and research information about the physical object, making maintenance of a catalog entry imperative for future research and education.&lt;ref name="AMNH" /&gt; Most modern collectors and institutions utilize CMS to streamline the catalog process. For this to be effective, data entry standards must be utilized for data structure, data values, and data content, which then "form the basis for a set of tools that can lead to good descriptive cataloguing, consistent documentation, shared records, and increased end-user access."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Visual Resources Association|title= Cataloging Cultural Objects: Executive Summary|year =2006 |url =http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/execsumm.html|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curation===
[[Content curation|Curation]] can be defined as the collecting, organizing, preserving, and displaying of information about a specific object or collection topic. The role of curating is performed by individuals known as [[curators]], who are trained as subject specialists. Where collection managers and registrars can be seen as record keepers, or in some cases, jacks-of-all-trades, curators pursue specialized training in a given subject matter which allows them to conduct research on objects, offer guidance in the organization of a collection, and select objects to be utilized in [[exhibition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Glaser|first =Jane R.|last2 =Zenetou|first2 =Artemis A.|title =Museums: A Place to Work, Planning Museum Careers|place =New York, NY|publisher =Routledge|year =1996|chapter =6: Museum professional positions: qualifications, duties, and responsibilities| pages =80–81|isbn =0-415-12256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curation therefore entails the aesthetic details of a collection and involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, as well as the in-depth research and writing of papers associated with the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =1B: Collection Roles|page =13| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital curation====
{{Main|Digital curation}}
Digital curation is an extension of content curation, and involves the collecting, preserving, and archiving of [[digital data|digital]] assets associated with digitized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Digital Curation? |publisher=[[Digital Curation Centre]] |url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about/what |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Yakel|first =Elizabeth|title=Digital curation |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=2007|url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/164/2007/00000023/00000004/art00003 |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital assets include both those items that originated in a digital form and are considered [[born-digital]] (i.e. websites, wikis, and digitally created sound and photographs), as well as [[analog recording|analog]] items that have been [[digitized]] (i.e. cataloged in digital form, while still maintaining the original physical/analog form).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Library of Congress|author-link= Library of Congress|title= Preserving Digital Culture|url= http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/swf/activity.swf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Erway|first =Ricky|title =Defining "Born Digital"|pages =4|date=November 2010|url =https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/activities/hiddencollections/borndigital.pdf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital curation, like content curation, also involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, which in this case, often involves website maintenance for online exhibits.

Whether born-digital or digitized, many modern collections contain some form of digital collection content which must be maintained in much the same way as physical objects. Preservation of digital assets involves the creation of metadata to improve accessibility and object tracking, preventing technical obsolescence and data loss due to mismanagement, performing routine audits of technical software and digital catalogs to ensure data remains uncorrupted, applying authorization standards to protect data from unauthorized alterations, and managing content for the purposes of research and exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Higgins|first =Sarah|title =Digital Curation: The Emergence of a New Discipline|journal =The International Journal of Digital Curation|volume =6|issue =2|pages =78–88|publisher =University of Edinburgh|date =2011|url =http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/184/251|doi =10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.191|accessdate =April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections management policy==
The primary focus of collections management is to document the standards and practices necessary to develop, care for, and make available for use, the collection objects within a collector or institution's care. To accomplish this, a collections management policy is created in which detailed information is provided to explain the specific needs of the collection based on type, age, location, etc. Collection management policies are specific to the collection-holding institution and these policies lay out terms such as which personnel are responsible for individual tasks involving the collection, if and when an object should be acquired for or removed from the collection, who within the institution has access to the collection, and the preventive care needs of each object within the collection.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =2A: Collection Management Policies|pages =24–29| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and ethical considerations===
In addition to general care standards, a collection management policy is also governed by the local and international legal restrictions placed on certain cultural heritage objects and the management needs associated with them. There are countless laws on the books that specify how [[antiquities]], [[archaeological]] findings, and [[ethnic]] pieces must be handled and maintained to ensure their physical safety as well as the ethical considerations that these unique collection objects must address.

Examples of local laws within the United States of America include:

* ''[[Antiquities Act|Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities]]'', June 8, 1906 (“The Antiquities Act”) (16 USC 431-433): authorizes the [[President of the United States]] to declare [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]], and enforces regulations protecting archaeological sites and excavated objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Appendix A: Mandates and Standards for NPS Museum Collections|year =2000|page =A:1|url= http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/AppendA.pdf|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Museum Properties Management Act of 1955'', (16 USC, Sect. 18 [f]): explains the responsibilities and actions that may be performed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] through the [[National Park Service]] to include accepting donations and bequests of money, purchasing museum objects and collections, making exchanges of museum objects or collections, and accepting and making loans of museum objects or collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Legal Information Institute|author-link=Legal Information Institute|title= 16 U.S. Code § 18f - Management of museum properties|year =2012|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/18f?qt-us_code_tabs=0#qt-us_code_tabs|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990(NAGPRA)]]'', (25 USC 3001-13): identifies ownership and control rights for Native American cultural items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Legal Information Institute|author-link=Legal Information Institute|title= 25 U.S. Code Chapter 32 - Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation|year =n.d.|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-32|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of international legislation include:

* ''The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]]'', (adopted 14 May 1954): an international treaty focused on protecting cultural heritage such as architectural monuments, archaeological locations, works of art, and any objects deemed to have artistic, historic, or scientific significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|year =n.d.|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/the-hague-convention/|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]]'', (Paris, 14 November 1970): an international agreement to oppose the practices of illicit importing, exporting, and transferring of ownership of cultural property in order to better preserve the cultural property of the countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|year =n.d.|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]'', (Paris, 17 October 2003): an international agreement designed to safeguard [[intangible cultural heritage]] while also raising awareness and appreciation thereof. Intangible cultural heritage includes "the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=United Nations Educational, Scientific |author2=Cultural Organization|author-link= United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|title= Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 2003|year =2003|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|accessdate= April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection scope===
Written as a subsection of the overarching collection management policy, most collectors and cultural institutions utilize a [[collections policy]], or selection criteria policy, in which it is outlined what purpose the collection serves, and the types of objects that are considered most relevant. The collection policy lays out the scope of the collection and its relevance to the institution's mission statement by serving as "a broad description of the [institution's] collections and an explanation of how and what the museum collects and how those collections are used." &lt;ref name= "AAM"&gt;{{Citation |last =American Alliance of Museums|author-link=American Alliance of Museums|title=Developing a Collections Management Policy|year =2012|page =4|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the collection as laid on it in this policy serves to define if, when, and how a cultural institution chooses to accession or deaccession objects from its collection. Additionally, as different types of collections require unique care protocols, the collection policy also details the categories associated with the collection such as library or archive, education or research, permanent, and exhibit.  The collection policy might also address conflicts of interest for employees who hold personal collections that are similar to those of the institution within which they are employed.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "AAM" /&gt;

====Accessioning====
Accessioning can be defined as "the process of creating a permanent record of an object, assemblage, or lot received from one source at one time for which the [institution] has custody, right, or title, and assigning a unique control number to said object, assembly, or lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =University of Alaska Museum of the North|author-link=University of Alaska Museum of the North|title=Acquistitions and Accessioning|date= May 14, 2009|url=http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/ethno/policies/acquisitions/|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the collection scope policy, collectors and institutions must lay out acquisition terms to ensure only relevant objects are successfully accessioned into the collection. This portion of the policy discusses: who within the institution is authorized to make decisions on whether an object is acquired or not, under what legal terms the object is to be acquired (i.e. documentation proving legal purchase, import and export restrictions, and intellectual property rights), and [[wikt:repository|repository]] agreement information if the object is to be stored within an offsite facility.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt; The accessioning section of the collection policy might also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the collection by examining the history of the collection as a whole. This in turn allows the collector or institution to set guidelines for improving, growing, and developing the collection in a way that is of most benefit.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt;

====Deaccessioning====
Deaccessioning is the opposite of accessioning and involves the permanent removal of an object and all associated records from a collector's or institution's collection. Like the accession portion of the collection policy, the deaccession section lays out the terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions associated with removal of the object, and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.&lt;ref name= "MRM5,2A" /&gt; There are many reasons that an object may be removed from a collection including:

* The object has been deemed no longer relevant to the collection-holder's mission or permanent collection scope.
* The condition of the object has deteriorated or been damaged to such an extent that the collection-holder cannot implement restoration repairs, or the object now poses a health risk for institution personnel.
* The institution no longer possess the means to maintain the object in an adequate environment due to financial or budgeting concerns, loss of personnel, lack of equipment, etc.
* The institution already possesses similar objects within the collection, which causes an unnecessary redundancy.
* The object has been deemed a fake or forgery, or not authentic and no longer relevant to the overall collection.
* The collection-holder is in a position in which deaccessioning an object will improve the quality of care and function of the remaining collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Loyola University Museum of Art|author-link = Loyola University Museum of Art|title = LUMA Acquisition and Deacquisition Policies|year = n.d.|url = http://www.luc.edu/luma/collections/collections_acquisition.html|accessdate = April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loans and temporary custody of objects====
Collectors and collecting institutions sometimes transfer objects to or from their collections for temporary periods of time as part of loan or temporary custody agreements. These loans help share and disseminate information to different communities and can prove mutually beneficial to both collection-holding individuals or institutions.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt; Loans can occur for a variety of reasons and for policy purposes loans may be defined as: stationary or traveling exhibition loans, exchange loans, study loans, promised gifts, fractional-interest gifts (a "donor's remaining interest in a partial gift"), and long-term loans. The policies for loans may also be applied to acquisitions during the processing period, unsolicited objects until a return can be arranged, and collection objects or those objects found, abandoned, or unclaimed, in which ownership is unclear.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MRM5,3L"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =3L: Loans|page =120| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the collections scope section of a collections management policy, there is typically an area dedicated to discussing the procedures for loan approval and acceptance, associated acquisition fees, required documentation, specific insurance requirements, and monitoring instructions for the temporary holdings. This section may also include information about old loans and works with restrictions governing if and when they are allowed to leave the holding-institution.&lt;ref name="AAM" /&gt; The loan policy should address both incoming and outgoing loans with thoroughly explained written procedures.&lt;ref name="MRM5,3L" /&gt;

===Collections care===
[[Image:Visual storage - Victoria &amp; Albert Museum - 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|The visual storage facilities at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, England.]]
{{Main|Collections care}}

Collections care can be defined as the physical preventive care measures taken to prevent damage or delay the natural deterioration of cultural heritage collection objects. These practices strive to provide enhanced safety for collections by minimizing damages from external sources such as improper handling, vandalism, climate changes, overexposure to light, and pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Canadian Conservation Institute|author-link =Canadian Conservation Institute|title=Ten Agents of Deterioration|year =2013|url =http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/10agents/index-eng.aspx|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collections management policy carefully examines the collections care and [[collections maintenance (museum)]] needs of the individual objects within the collection, in order to provide practices and standards for how to mitigate threats, as well as the proper procedures for addressing issues as they arise. Sub-topics within this section may include display and storage housing, packing and transport, and integrated pest management.

====Display and storage housing====
When objects are held within a collection, either in storage or on display in an exhibit, the primary concern should be on the continued safety of the collection. To accomplish this, the collector or holding-institution must take into consideration proper housing containers, as well as environmental conditions necessary to prevent damages. The collections management policy for the collection should contain sections in which display and storage housing needs for the objects are addressed in full. Consultation with a [[conservator-restorer]] may be necessary to fully address these topics.

In terms of housing, solid [[structural design]] is vital in ensuring objects remain undamaged while stationary. This includes accounting for padding and support of the objects to prevent damage from bumps and snags, and stable display cases or mounts, which often requires collaboration with a [[mount maker]] to ensure proper creation and installation. Stands, shelves, drawers, and cases, in addition to fasteners, adhesives, papers, and foams, must all be chosen based on their compatibility with the structural design and materials of each individual object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5H: Storage|pages =295–296| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections management policy should outline housing specifications such as the use of acid-free (pH neutral) and dye-free materials; types of enclosed [[cabinetry]] where available; appropriate coverings such as fabrics (e.g. unbleached [[muslin]]), [[polyethylene]] sheeting, and [[foam|closed-cell foam]] (e.g. Ethafoam); containers made of paper, plastic, wood, or metal; enclosures such as folders or mats; and standards for frames, supports, and mounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5J: Preparation| pages =307–310| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main environmental conditions that require outlined protocols in the collections management policy include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]] (RH), light, and [[contaminants]].&lt;ref name="MRM5,5G"&gt;{{cite book|last =Buck|first =Rebecca A.|last2 =Gilmore|first2 =Jean Allman|title =Museum Registration Methods|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year =2010|edition =5|chapter =5G: Preventive Care|pages =287–292| isbn =978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to completely prevent natural deterioration of objects, but by carefully monitoring and implementing policies regarding environmental conditions, the effects of these conditions can be greatly reduced.

* ''Temperature'': There is some flexibility allowed when addressing temperature, as it is impossible to control external weather. However, policy standards should aim to set temperature ranges that are optimized for the type of objects being preserved, the collector's or institution's energy and financial restrictions, as well as human comfort levels within both exhibit galleries and storage facilities.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David |author2=Charles S. Tumosa |author3=Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying Science to the Question of Museum Climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Relative humidity'': Like temperature, RH standards, also allow for some fluctuations, although policies should take into account that excessive [[moisture]] or sudden dramatic shifts in relative humidity, can be harmful to almost all cultural heritage materials and may cause issues such as [[corrosion]], [[mold]] growth, cracking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Crack|title=Crack|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; warping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Warp_(damage)|title=Warp (damage)|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name =Erhardt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mecklenburg|first=Marion F.|author2=Charles S. Tumosa|title=Temperature and Relative Humidity Effects on the Mechanical and Chemical Stability of Collections|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=April 1999|pages=69–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Light'': There are two types of light- [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and visual [[light]] as perceived by the human eye- that need to be addressed within collections management and care. The effects of visual light exposure is cumulative, but visual light is necessary to view and safely handle objects within a collection, which means that standards should be established to limit time and intensity levels of visual light exposure, without risking visitor or staff safety.&lt;ref name ="Michalski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michalski|first=Stefan|title=The Lighting Decision|journal=CCI Preprints|year=1997|series=Canadian Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; UV light, on the other hand, is not necessary for viewing or handling of collections, and as such should be eliminated as much as possible through the use of [[filter (optics)|filters]] in order to prevent damage such as yellowing or disintegration.&lt;ref name ="Michalski" /&gt;
* ''Contaminants'': Contaminants can take a variety of forms such as gases, liquids, or solids, and they can pose threats not only to a collection, but also to those individuals that come in close contact with the pollutants. To ensure the safety of personnel and objects, it is necessary for a collection management policy to specify the proper methods for documenting and researching objects that are a risk for bringing contaminants into the collection, as well as explaining what precautions must be taken to prevent accidental contamination as the result of human error or the chemical breakdown of collection objects. Contaminated objects may show signs of disintegration, discoloration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Discoloration|title=Discoloration|work=conservation-wiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or corrosion.&lt;ref name ="MRM5,5G" /&gt;

====Packing and transport====
Objects within a collection should ideally, be handled as little as possible since every time they are handled, they are at an increased risk of damage. Proper display and storage housing will help to mitigate some of the risks of accidental damage, but it is important to create and implement high standards for the routine care and handling, as well as the packing and transporting, of collection objects.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp6"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1999|chapter =Chapter 6: Handling, Packing, and Shipping|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP6.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely important to ensure that staff are aware of and educated on standard practices for handling objects such as hand washing protocols, the appropriate use of cotton or latex gloves, established practices for identifying structural weaknesses that may require special care, and the accepted modes of transportation of objects within the holding-institution (i.e. flatbeds, carts, tote pans, pads, and tissue papers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ontario Ministry of Culture, Heritage and Libraries Branch|title=Museum Notes #6: Handling Museum Objects|year =2005|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/pdf/handling_museum_objects.pdf|accessdate =April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a collector or institution will have a need to move objects outside of exhibit and storage locations. The collection management policy, which discusses the proper procedures for loans and acquisitions, must therefore also address proper packing and transport protocols to ensure that the objects arrive at their destination safely. To ensure safe transport, safe handling techniques must be combined with individual packing requirements for the specific object being shipped. Ideally, the object will be packaged in a [[shipping container]] that provides protection from shock, vibration, sudden climate changes, and mishandling. Collection management policies will advise staff on how best to address issues such as "the object's fragility, the shipping method, the climate through which the objects will travel, and the climate at the object's destination."&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp6" /&gt; During the packing and transport process, it is likely that several departments within the shipping institution may contribute, and collaboration with the receiving institution must be arranged to provide policies for acclimatization and unpacking of the object once received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Emily|author2=Leslie Williamson |author3=Rachel Perkins Arenstein |author4=Angela Yvarra McGrew |author5=Mark Feitl |title=Integrating Preventive Conservation into a Collections Move and Rehousing Project at the National Museum of the American Indian|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|year=2005|volume=44|issue=3|pages=217–232|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic44-03-006_indx.html|accessdate =April 28, 2014 |doi=10.1179/019713605806082293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Mervin, Marion F.

====Integrated pest management====
{{Main|Museum integrated pest management}}

Within the collections care section of a collections management policy, there is typically a section dedicated to integrated pest management (IPM). This section covers the policies related to the prevention and suppression methods of various types of pests typically found within collections. IPM focuses on utilizing non-pesticide prevention and treatment techniques in order to minimize health risks for personnel as well as damages to the collection itself. Examples of types of pests that should be addressed include "insects, mold, mice, rats, birds, and bats."&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp5"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 5: Biological Infestations|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection management aspect of IPM involves creating and implementing policies for the routine inspection of objects and housing facilities, authorized trapping procedures, and documentation of all inspections or trapping programs utilized within the facility. These policies are called cultural controls, and the physical techniques utilized as part of the collections care are known as mechanical controls.&lt;ref name ="NPS,Chp5" /&gt; Specific cultural controls that may be documented within the collections management policy include:

* Standards for the inspection of all new materials to be brought into collection areas including new acquisitions and loans, and storage or packing materials.
* Defined practices for daily collections maintenance and general housekeeping of collection-holding facilities.
* Restrictions on areas within the building where food, drinks, and smoking are allowed and prohibited.
* Documentation showing the careful monitoring of plants placed around the outside of the building, with special attention paid to the proximity of live plants and mulch to the building, in addition to banning live and dried plants within the building.
* Policies for standard collections care including relative humidity, and storage and housing guidelines.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp5" /&gt;

===Emergency planning and response===
{{Main|Emergency response (museum)}}

Collections management focuses heavily on planning and response standards, and lays out these practices in documents detailing how staff responsible for the care of a collection should address the various needs of the collection. Created in conjunction with the collection management policy, most collecting institutions will also possess a disaster preparedness and emergency response policy that outlines what procedures should be taken to prevent injury or loss of life for all personnel and building visitors, as well as how to minimize damages or loss to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 10: Emergency Planning|url =http://www.nps.gov/history/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP10A-B.pdf|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan often contains a section identifying potential risks for the collection based on the region in which the collection is located, including fires, earthquakes, criminal activity, or flooding, in addition to damages from repairs, building failure, improper collections care, and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =American Museum of Natural History|author-link=American Museum of Natural History|title=Risk Management and Disaster Planning|year =n.d.|url =http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/9/risk-management-and-disaster-planning|accessdate= April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan should also outline protocols for how to handle a disaster, starting with the chain of command within the emergency response team, as well as the individual responsibilities of each member of the staff. The emergency response team will include a managing official responsible for notifying other members of the team of a disaster and overseeing the implementation of the emergency response tasks. These staff members are typically trained in proper collection handling protocols. The disaster preparedness and emergency response plan should also include detailed instructions explaining how each type of disaster should be handled including the initial [[threat assessment]] and response, evacuation procedures where appropriate, damage mitigation plans, salvage priorities, and post-damage inventories and recovery procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =International Council of Museums|author-link=International Council of Museums|title=Guidelines for Disaster Preparedness in Museums

{{wiktionary}}
'''Comic relief''' is the inclusion of a [[humour|humorous]] character, scene, or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of a bumbling, [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]ing [[sidekick]] of the [[hero]] or [[villain]] in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the [[hero]]'s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Use==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is [[comic]]. This generally occurs when the work enters a [[drama]]tic moment, but the character continues to be comical  regardless.
[[Greek tragedy]] did not allow any comic relief within the drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/European-History-670/Greek-Tragedy-English-Tragedy.htm|title=Greek Tragedy and English Tragedy|last=Rutherford|first=Sam|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous [[satyr play]]. Even the Elizabethan critic Sidney following [[Horace]]’s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' pleaded for the exclusion of  comic elements  from a tragic  drama. But in the Renaissance England Marlowe among the [[University Wits]] introduced comic relief through  the presentation of crude scenes in Doctor Faustus following the native tradition of Interlude which was usually introduced between two tragic plays. In fact, in the classical tradition the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.

==Examples==
[[William Shakespeare]] deviated from the classical tradition and used comic relief in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The Porter scene in ''Macbeth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tromly |first=Frederic B.|date=Spring 1975|title=Macbeth and His Porter |journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=26|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.2307/2869244|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|jstor=2869244}}&lt;/ref&gt; the grave-digger scene in ''Hamlet'' and the gulling of Roderigo provide immense comic relief. The mockery of the fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' may also be regarded as a comic relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draudt|first=Manfred|year=2002|title=The Comedy of Hamlet|journal=Atlantis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=85–107|issn=0210-6124|url=http://www.atlantisjournal.org/Papers/24_1/draudt.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

The '''Cyber Storm exercise''' was a [[simulated]] exercise overseen by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] that took place February 6 through February 10, 2006 with the purpose of testing the nation's defenses against [[Hacker (computer security)|digital espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1158340980371.shtm Fact Sheet: Cyber Storm Exercise] ([[Department of Homeland Security]]). Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/prep_cyberstormreport_sep06.pdf Cyber Storm Exercise Report] (Department of Homeland Security)&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation was targeted primarily at American security organizations but officials from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand participated as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kapica, Jack. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080131.WBcyberia20080131112514/WBStory/WBcyberia A blogger’s paranoia], [[The Globe and Mail]], Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation ==
The exercise simulated a large scale attack on critical digital infrastructure such as [[communications]], [[transportation]], and [[energy production]]. The simulation took place a series of incidents which included:

*[[Washington, D.C. Metro]] trains mysteriously shutting down.
*[[Bloggers]] revealing locations of railcars containing hazardous materials.
*The [[Control tower|airport control towers]] of [[Philadelphia]] and Chicago mysteriously shutting down.
*A mysterious liquid appearing on a London subway.
*Significant numbers of people on [[No Fly List|"no fly" lists]] suddenly appearing at airports all over the nation.
*Planes flying too close to the [[White House]].
*Water utilities in Los Angeles getting compromised.

== Internal difficulties ==
During the exercise the computers running the simulation came under attack by the players themselves. Heavily censored files released to the [[Associated Press]] reveal that at some time during the exercise the organizers sent every one involved an [[e-mail]] marked "IMPORTANT!" telling the participants in the simulation not to attack the game's control computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cybertalkblog.co.uk/cyber-news-blog/cyber-war-games-highlight-vital-security-flaws/|title=Cyber ‘War’ Games Highlight Vital Security Flaws|website=www.cybertalkblog.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance of participants ==
The Cyber Storm exercise highlighted the gaps and shortcomings of the nation's cyber defenses. The cyber storm exercise report found that institutions under attack had a hard time getting the bigger picture and instead focused on single incidents treating them as "individual and discrete".&lt;ref&gt;Wait, Patience. [http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/42017-1.html Cyber Storm exercise challenged coordination, communications] (Government computer news). Accessed February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the test the Department of Homeland Security raised concern that the relatively modest resources assigned to cyber-defense would be "overwhelmed in a real attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/303 DHS releases report on Cyber Storm exercise].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10231">'''Cyber spying''', or '''cyber espionage''', is the act or practice of obtaining secrets and information without the permission and knowledge of the holder of the information from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage using methods on the Internet, networks or individual computers through the use of [[proxy server]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential proxy network use cases|url=https://www.geosurf.com/proxy-use-cases/|publisher=GeoSurf|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[hacker (computer security)|cracking]] techniques and [[malicious software]] including [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] and [[spyware]].&lt;ref name=pcmag&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Espionage|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/64376/cyber-espionage|publisher=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberspying|url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/27101/cyberspying|publisher=Techopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may wholly be perpetrated online from computer desks of professionals on bases in far away countries or may involve infiltration at home by computer trained conventional [[Espionage|spies]] and [[mole (espionage)|moles]] or in other cases may be the [[criminal]] handiwork of [[amateur]] malicious hackers and [[software programmer]]s.&lt;ref name=pcmag/&gt;

==Details==
Cyber spying typically involves the use of such access to secrets and classified information or control of individual computers or whole networks for a [[strategy|strategic]] advantage and for [[psychological subversion|psychological]], [[subversion (politics)|political]] and physical subversion activities and [[sabotage]].&lt;ref name=messmer&gt;{{cite web|last=Messmer|first=Ellen|title=Cyber Espionage: A Growing Threat to Business|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/141474/article.html|accessdate=Jan 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, cyber spying involves analysis of public activity on social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockergnome.com/news/2011/11/07/five-ways-the-government-spies-on-you/ Five ways the government spies on you]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such operations, like non-cyber espionage, are typically illegal in the victim country while fully supported by the highest level of government in the aggressor country. The ethical situation likewise depends on one's viewpoint, particularly one's opinion of the governments involved.&lt;ref name=messmer/&gt;

In response to reports of cyber spying by China against the United States, [[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that China and the United States should agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to [[cyberspace]]. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps or engaging in cyber espionage; it would also entail vetting these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai, "MAR: A Model for US-China Relations," The Diplomat, September 20, 2013, [http://thediplomat.com/2013/09/mar-a-model-for-us-china-relations/].&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the United States and China agreed not to allow parties in their nations to cyberspy on each other for commercial gain, but did not prohibit government spying.&lt;ref name ="steinberg"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/why-the-china-us-cybersecurity-agreement-will-fail.html |work=Inc. | title=Why the China-US CyberSecurity Agreement Will Fail | date=September 27, 2015 | accessdate=September 27, 2015 |author=Josep Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}
In [[Indic scripts]], the '''danda''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दण्ड ''{{IAST|daṇḍa}}'' "stick") is a [[punctuation]] [[character (computing)|character]]. The [[glyph]] consists of a single vertical stroke. The character can be found at [[character encoding|code point]] U+0964 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0964;}}) in [[Unicode]]. The "double danda" is at  U+0965 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0965;}}). [[ISCII]] encodes danda at 0xEA.

The danda marks the end of a sentence or period, comparable to a [[full stop]] (period) as commonly used in the [[Latin alphabet]], and is used alternate with Western punctuation in most modern [[Languages of India|Indic]] languages. In metrical texts, a double danda is used to delimit verses, and a single danda to delimit a [[pada (foot)|pada]] or semi-verse.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The space is important for ionic signalling. For example, the phenomenon of ''calcium-induced calcium release'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Cannell |last2=Kong |last3=Imtiaz |last4=Laver |year=2013 |title=Control of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release by stochastic RyR gating within a 3D model of the cardiac dyad and importance of induction decay for CICR termination. |journal=Biophysical Journal |publisher=Elsevier |volume=104 |issue=10 |pages=2149–59 |doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2013.03.058 |pmid=23708355 |pmc=3660628}}&lt;!--|access-date=28 July 2015--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; when extracellular calcium enters the cell through [[ion channels]] in [[T-Tubule]]s, leading to a rapidly increased calcium concentration in the dyadic space, triggering [[ryanodine receptor]]s on the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] to release more calcium and trigger [[cardiac myocyte]] contraction - the heart beat.

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

{{for|the molding defect|Flow marks}}

A '''flow line''', used on a drilling rig, is a large diameter pipe (typically a section of [[Casing (borehole)|casing]]) that is connected to the [[bell nipple]] (under the [[drill floor]]) and extends to the [[possum belly]] (on the [[mud tank]]s) and acts as a return line, (for the [[drilling fluid]] as it comes out of the hole), to the [[mud tank]]s.

==Flow Line Components==

The flow line will typically have equipment attached to it, such as a [[flow show]], [[possum belly]] and the [[sample box]]

===Flow Show===

The [[flow show]] ''shows'' whether [[drilling fluid]] is flowing down the flow line or not and any changes in that flow. High-pressure jets are typically attached along its length to dislodge any obstructions (such as [[drill cuttings]] collecting in one spot) that may occur. 

===Possum Belly===

The [[possum belly]] is used to slow the flow of returning [[drilling fluid]] before it hits the [[shale shakers]]. This enables the shale shaker to clean the cuttings out of the drilling fluid before it is returned to the pits for circulation.

===Sample Box===

Another common add on is the sample box. This is a heavy duty rubber hose that is inserted at the end of the flow line and at the other end emplaced into the sample box itself. The sample box is used to capture samples of drill cuttings for geological logging. The box is typically equipped with a raising door that allows the water and cuttings to escape after a sample is collected.

==Stinger Line==

A stinger line is similar to a flow line, but unlike a flow line is not used to maintain circulation. The stinger line is attached to the [[blowout preventer]] to allow for the pressure from a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] to be released. The stinger line usually will run parallel to the flow line.

The '''GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel''' ('''GEOMAR'''), former ''Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften'', IFM-GEOMAR), is a research institute in [[Kiel]], Germany. It was formed in 2004 by merging the Institute for Marine Science ([[Institut für Meereskunde Kiel]], (IFM)) with the Research Center for Marine Geosciences (GEOMAR) and is co-funded by both federal and provincial governments.&lt;ref name=GMRC /&gt; It was a member of the [[Leibniz Association]] till 2012 and is coordinator of the [[FishBase Consortium]].&lt;ref name=Palomares /&gt; Since 2012 it is member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]] and named ''GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel''.

==Research divisions==
GEOMAR is structured into four research divisions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=struktur&amp;L=1 Organizational Structure of the Institute] IFM-GEOMAR web site.Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Physical oceanography|Ocean circulation and climate dynamics]]: This division, led by [[Mojib Latif]], investigates climate from different time perspectives, with computer simulations and ocean current models that include meteorological, geological and oceanographic considerations. Current ocean measurements are made from research vessels at sea, and include the use of [[remote sensing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=ozeanzirkulation&amp;L=1 Research Division 1: Ocean Circulation and Climate Dynamics] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 5 August 2010. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marine biogeochemistry: Work in this division looks at the way the components of the marine [[biogeochemical]] processes interact with each other. These components include the material in the atmosphere, the sediment and oceanic reservoirs, and the biological organisms including humans. Particular attention is paid to the atmosphere/ocean interface and the sediment/ocean interface, as well as to elements and compounds which can cycle and cause [[radiative forcing]]. Research ranges from the atmosphere over the ocean, through the ocean [[surface layer]] into the [[water column]], and then down to the [[Pelagic sediments|marine sediments]] and the [[oceanic crust]]. [[Field work]] is also undertakes, as well as laboratory and [[mesocosm]] studies. The division also develops biological, chemical and isotope diagnostic tools for measuring [[Proxy (climate)|proxy variables]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=21&amp;L=1 Research Division 2: Marine biogeochemistry] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 2 November 2010. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marine biology|Marine ecology]]: This division, led by Ulrich Sommer, aims to "understand the sensitivity of [[marine ecosystem]]s to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural changes, with a mid-term focus on climate change and [[overexploitation]] of marine bio-resources." It is important to understand how much stress a given ecosystem can absorb before structural shifts occur. When a shift does occur, it is necessary to understand how this will impact the ecosystem populations and the degree to which the shift can be reversed. Structural shifts can result in invasions by harmful organisms, species collapse and a radical reconfiguring of the biogeochemical cycles. Traditional approaches group species broadly into size classes and [[trophic level]]s measured by [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] or [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. But to understand how ecosystems react to natural and anthropogenic stressors, specific differences in the way individual species react must also be understood, particularly where [[keystone species]] are involved. Research within this division range from genes to ecosystems, including the "[[ecophysiology]] of key species and its genetic basis, dynamics and genetics of individual populations and of communities, interactions within and among species, structure and response of entire [[food web]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=559&amp;L=1 Research Division 3: Marine Ecology] IFM-GEOMAR. Updated 27 November 2009. Retrieved 24 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamics of the ocean floor: Research is focused on "processes that shape the [[oceanic lithosphere]], and the impact of these processes on the environment, e.g. climate and natural hazards. These research themes are pursued in the three main [[geotectonic]] settings: divergent and [[Convergent boundary|convergent margins]] and in intraplate regions. These three settings represent critical stages in the life-cycle of the [[ocean floor]].  The [[ocean basin]]s are created by the [[rifting]] apart of continents. [[Oceanic lithosphere]] then forms at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. It is subsequently modified by low and high temperature interactions with the overlying oceans, the addition of intraplate [[magma]]s, the deposition of [[marine sediment]]s, and tectonic processes occurring at or near [[Transform plate|transform]] and [[convergent plate]] margins. When it [[subduct]]s at convergent margins, the dehydration of the plate induces [[arc volcanism]] that creates and modifies the [[continental crust]] and transfers climate-relevant volatiles into the atmosphere. Such [[continental margin]]s are sites of sediment accumulation, fluid exchange, important resources and major geo-hazards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-geomar.de/index.php?id=dynamik&amp;L=1 Research Division 4: Dynamics of the ocean floor] IFM-GEOMAR.

'''Hermann Abert''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːbɐt|lang}}; 25 March 1871 – 13 August 1927) was a [[Germany|German]] [[history of music|historian of music]].

==Life==
Abert was born in [[Stuttgart]], the son of [[Johann Josef Abert]] (1832-1915), the ''[[Hofkapellmeister]]'' of that city.

From 1890 to 1896 he studied classical [[philology]] at the Universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. While at Tübingen he joined the ''[[Akademische Gesellschaft Stuttgardia]]'', a student fraternity which shaped the political views of the liberalism in southern Germany. His philological studies ended in 1896 at [[University of Halle|Halle]], where he had done work on [[Ancient Greek music]]. For the next three years he studied [[music theory]] at Berlin. In 1902 he qualified as lecturer by presenting his thesis on [[music of the Middle Ages]] at the [[University of Halle]].

Abert stayed on at Halle as a lecturer, becoming a senior lecturer (or associate professor) in 1910 and a full professor in 1918. In this capacity he moved the next year to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. But after just one year, Abert took up a post at [[Leipzig]] and in 1920 he became the successor of the music theorist [[Hugo Riemann]]. In 1923 he was called to the [[University of Berlin]], where he was seen as the most suitable successor to [[Hermann Kretzschmar]], also a music theorist. It was there that he worked with [[Friedrich Blume]], [[Rudolf Gerber]], Hans Hoffmann and [[Theodor Schwartzkopff]], on the illustrated ''Dictionary of Music'' which was discovered to contain plagiarisms of [[Alfred Einstein]]'s ''Neues Musiklexikon und Hugo-Riemann-Musiklexikon''. &lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Zeitung.'' 11 August 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was admitted to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], the first music theorist to be granted this honour.

On 13 August 1927, Prof. Dr. Hermann Abert died at [[Stuttgart]], aged 56.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">{{sociology}}
'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structures]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex social processes. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, which affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]] and [[income inequality]] to [[war]].

Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analysing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==Use of history in sociology==
As time has passed, history and sociology have developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways.  The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process. The second theory that sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analysed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition. And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: " a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill's method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2007. "Comparative and Historical Sociology: Lecture Notes." &lt;http://deflem.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparative-and-historical-sociology.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. "Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence." EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence==
[[Path dependence]] to some sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However, sociologist James Mahoney has a different definition of path dependence. His theory suggests that "process, sequence, and temporality" have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. "1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. "Path Dependence in Historical Sociology." Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over general theory in sociology==
James Mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, causal agents and causal mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory.
{{quote|... the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James.

'''Implicit cognition''' refers to unconscious influences such as [[knowledge]], [[perception]], or [[memory]], that influence a person's [[behavior]], even though they themselves have no conscious awareness whatsoever of those influences.&lt;ref name="ReingoldRay2006"/&gt;

==Overview==
Implicit cognition is everything one does and learns unconsciously or without any awareness that one is doing it. An example of implicit cognition could be when a person first learns to ride a bike: at first they are aware that they are learning the required skills. After having stopped for many years, when the person starts to ride the bike again they do not have to relearn the motor skills required, as their implicit knowledge of the motor skills&lt;ref name=Baddeley1997/&gt; takes over and they can just start riding the bike as if they had never stopped. In other words, they do not have to think about the actions that they are performing in order to ride the bike. It can be seen with this example that implicit cognition is involved with many of the different mental activities and everyday situations of people's daily lives.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; There are many processes in which implicit memory works, which include learning, our social cognition, and our problem solving skills.

==History==
Implicit cognition was first discovered in the year of 1649 by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]''. He said in one of his writings that he saw that unpleasant childhood experiences remain imprinted in a child's brain until its death without any conscious memory of it remaining.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; Even though this idea was never accepted by any of his peers, in 1704 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in his ''[[New Essays Concerning Human Understanding]]'' stressed the importance of unconscious perceptions which he said were the ideas that we are not consciously aware of yet still influence people's behavior.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; He claimed that people have residual effects of prior impressions without any remembrance of them. In 1802&lt;!--Schachter 1987 incorrectly gives 1804, but the book was published in 1802--&gt; French philosopher [[Maine de Biran]] in his ''The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking'' was the first person after Leibniz to systematically discuss implicit memory stating that after enough repetition, a habit can become automatic or completed without any conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; In 1870 [[Ewald Hering]] said that it was essential to consider unconscious memory, which is involved in involuntary recall, and the development of automatic and unconscious habitual actions.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt;

==Implicit learning==
Implicit learning starts in our early childhood, this means that people are not able to learn the proper grammar and rules to speaking a language until the age of seven. So if this is the case then how do we learn to talk by the age of four? One of the ways that this is possible is through implicit learning and association. Children learn their first language from what they hear when they are listening to the adults and through their own talking activities.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; This goes to show that the way children learn language involves implicit learning.

===Studies on implicit learning===
A study was conducted with amnesiac patients in an attempt to demonstrate that amnesiac patients that were unable to learn a list of words or pictures when their performance was tested were able to complete or put together fragmented words and incomplete pictures. This was found to be true as the patients were able to perform better when asked to complete words or pictures. A possible explanation for this could be that implicit memory should be less susceptible to damage that may happen to the brain than explicit memory.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; There was a case where a 54-year-old man that had bitemporal damage worse on the right side had a hard time remembering things from his own life as well as famous events, names and even; yet he was able to perform within the normal limits with a word completion task involving famous names and with judgments of famous faces.&lt;ref name=Baddeley2002/&gt; This is a prime example that implicit memory can be less vulnerable to brain damage.

A famous study investigated the Identification blindsight effect with individuals who had suffered damage to one half of the visual cortex and were blind in the opposite half of the visual field.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; It was discovered that when objects or pictures were shown to these blind areas, the participants said that they saw no object or picture, but a certain number were able to identify the stimulus as either a cross or circle when asked to guess at a considerably higher rate than would have been expected by chance.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; The reason that this happened is because the information was able to be process through the first three stages of selection, organization, and interpretation or comprehension of the perceptual cycle but failed at only the last stage of retention and memory where the identified image is entered into their awareness. Thus stimuli can enter implicit memory even when people are unable to consciously perceive them.

==Implicit social relations==
Implicit cognition also plays a role in social cognition. People tend to see objects and individuals as more encouraging or acceptable the more often&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; that people are exposed to them. An example includes the False-fame Effect.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; Graf and Masson (1993) conducted a study where they showed participants a list with both famous and non-famous names. When it was shown around people were able to recall the famous names more than the non-famous names initially, but after about a 24-hour delay participants began to associate the non-famous names with famous people. This supports implicit cognition because the participants began to unconsciously associate the non-famous names with famous people.

Although the process is unconscious, implicit cognition influences how people view each other as well as their interactions with one another. People tend to view those who look alike as belonging together or to similar groups&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; and associate them with the social groups that existed in their high school years. These groups represented different relations between the students and were made up of students who were perceived as having similarities among each other. 
A study was conducted to see the amount of distance that participants put between individuals given certain circumstances. The participants were asked to place figures of individuals where they thought the figures should be standing given certain circumstances. It was found that people typically place men and women close to each other, to make little families formed with the figures of a woman, a man and of children.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; The participants did the same when asked to show friends and/or acquaintances, the two figures were placed relatively close to one another rather than if they were asked to represent strangers. When asked to represent strangers the participants placed the figures far apart. There are two parts to the social relations view that is liking relations were the ultimate goal is to be together, then there is the disliking relation view which is separation from the person.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; An example of this could be when someone is walking down a hall way and see someone whom they know and like that person is more likely to wave and say hello to them. On the other hand, say the person they see is someone whom they dislike, their response will be the opposite as they try to either avoid them or get away from them as quickly as possible showing the separation between the two of them. There are two views to the social relations theory, one of them is that people are out to mainly seek dominance of those around them, while the other view is that people mainly see the relations as either belonging or not belonging or liking and disliking on another. It is seen that males mainly seek dominance against one another as they are competitive and looking to outdo one another. For females on the other hand it is seen that women perceive their social views and values as more of the belonging or liking scale in terms of their closeness to one another. Implicit cognition not only involved how people view each other but also how they view themselves. This means that our own image is constructed from what others see of us&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; rather than our own views. The way that we view ourselves is from what others see us as, or from the times that we compare ourselves to other people.  The way that this plays a role in implicit cognition is because all of these actions people do unconsciously, or they are unaware that they are making these decision. Men do not consciously seek to be dominant over one another as women do not consciously arrange their social views or values in terms of their closeness. These are each things that people do without their conscious knowledge of these actions, which ties in with implicit cognition.

==Implicit behaviors==
{{tone|section|date=May 2016}}
There are scenarios when we act on something and then think back about handling it in different situation or manner. That is implicit cognition coming into play, the mind will then go based off ethical and similar situations when interacting with a certain thought. Implicit cognition and its automated thought process allows a person to decide something out of impulse. It is often defined as an involuntary process where tasks are easily absent of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, P, &amp; Schacter, D, L., (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; There are plenty of factors that influence behaviors and thought processes. Such as social learning, to stigmas, and two major aspects of implicit and explicit cognition. Implicit on one hand is obtained through social aspects and association, while explicit cognition is gained through propositional attitudes or beliefs of certain thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;Gawronski, B, &amp; Bodenhausen, G, V., (2006); Wilson, T. D., Lindsey, S., &amp; Schooler, T. Y. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit cognition can be incorporated with a mixture of attention, goals, self-association, and at times even motivational processes. Researchers have used different methods to test these theories of behavior correlation with implicit cognition. Using Implicit Association Tests (ITA's) is a method that is significantly used, according to Fazio &amp; Olsen (2003) and Richetin &amp; Richardson (2008). Since published, approximately ten years or so, it has been widely used influencing research on implicit attitudes. Implicit cognition is a process based off automatic mental interpretations. It's what a person really thinks, yet is not consciously aware of. Behavior is then affected, usually causing negative influences, both theoretically and empirical reasons presume that automatic cognitive processes are contributed to aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C, A., et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Impulse behaviors are often created without awareness. Negativity is a characteristic of implicit cognition, since it is an automated response. Explicit cognition is rarely used when trying to discover behavior of ones thought process. Researchers again use IAT's to determine ones thoughts and how a person incorporates these automatic processes, findings consider that implicit cognition may direct what behaviors a person may choose when facing extreme stimuli. For example, death can be perceived as positive, negative, or a combination of the two.  Depending on the attributes of death, it can include a general perspective or a "me" attribute. {{harvtxt|Nock et al.|2010}} implied that implicit association with death and or suicide initiates a final process when deciding how to cope to these extreme measures. Self- harm is another characteristic associated with implicit cognition. Because although we may think of it, it is controlled subconsciously. IAT's showed that there was a stronger correlation of implicit cognition and death/suicide than self-harm. The idea of pain may influence a person to think twice, while suicidal may seem quick, thus the automatic process can show how effective this negative behavior and implicit cognition come hand in hand. Automated processes doesn't allow a person to thoroughly create a conscious choice, therefore creating negative influence to behavior. Another negative behavior that can be associated with implicit cognition is depression. Whether a person takes a positive or negative outlook on the certain situation can produce if a person will be associated with depression. It is easier to determine an implicit mindset simple because it is outside of awareness. Implicit processes are considered critical when determining a person's reactions to a certain schema. Implicit cognition is often immediately affective towards a person's reaction.{{sfn|Haeffel et al.|2007}} Implicit cognitions also consisted of negative schemas that included hidden cognitive frameworks, and activation of stress. Awareness was often misinterpreted and implicit cognition emerged because of these negative schemas.&lt;ref&gt;(Scher, C, D., Ingram, R, E., &amp; Sega S, V., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors merged through implicit cognition involve a variety of addictive behaviors, problematic thinking, depression, aggression, suicide, death, and other negative factors. Certain life situations add to this schema, whether it be stressful situations, sudden, or anything along these lines, aspects of implicit cognition are used and evaluated.

Implicit cognition can also be associated with mental illness and the way thoughts are processed. Automatic stigmas and attitudes may anticipate other cognitive and behavior tendencies. A person with mental illness may be correlated with a guilt-related, self-associated personality.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J, F., et al., (2002) &amp; Greenwald, A, G., et al., (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these associations it may be managed outside one's own control and awareness, showing how implicit cognition is affected. However a dual process can be assessed within implicit and explicit cognition. An agreement between the two thought processes may be an issue, explicit may not be in contact with implicit, therefore causing more of a problem. Mental illness can include both implicit and explicit attitudes, however implicit self-concepts gave more negative consequence when dealing with mental illness. Much of implicit problems happened to be associated with alcohol, however this isn't the goal in order to describe a mental process and implicit cognition. The most widely influenced mental illness in association with implicit cognition would be Schizophrenia. Since a person of this illness has a problem of detecting what is real and what is not, implicit memory is often used with these patients. However, since it cannot really be detected if it is emotionally, mentally, or a combination of both some aspects of this illness are usually exercised uninterrupted, and unconsciously.{{sfn|Mano|Brown|2013}} Since schizophrenia is widely varied and has different characteristics, we cannot quite measure the outcome of implicit cognition.

==Definition==
Implicit cognition refers to perceptual, memory, comprehension, and performance processes that occur through unconscious awareness.{{sfn|Sun|2001}} For example, when a patient is discharged after a surgery, the effects of the anesthesia can cause abnormal behaviors without any conscious awareness. According to Wiers et al. (2006) some scholars argue implicit cognition is misinterpreted and could be used to improve behaviors while others highlight the dangers of it. Research studies have shown implicit cognition is a strong predictor for several issues like substance abuse, misconduct, and mental disorders.{{sfn|Wiers|Stacy|2006b}} These inherent thoughts are influenced from early adolescent experiences primarily a negative impact from culture. Adolescents who experience a rough childhood early on develop low levels of self-esteem. Therefore, the cognition to act dangerously is an oblivious development. Research for implicit cognition has started to grow especially within mental disorders.

==In mental disorders==
Schemas are used to interpret the functions involved when individuals would make sense of their surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street at the same time a car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a semantic process that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively.  This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for pathological anxiety.

The ideas of psychotic patients who have low self-esteem are prone to more serious illnesses. This concept was examined through both implicit and explicit perspectives by measuring the self-esteem of paranoia and depression patients. Previous research suggests that negative implicit cognition is not the symptoms for depression and paranoia, but it is an antecedent for the onset. Current research proposes that high implicit self-esteem is linked to less paranoia.{{sfn|Valiente et al.|2011}} It is imperative for patients who have low self-esteem to become more overt about these situations. Another study found a substantial association between adverse self-questioning in implicit cognition and depression.  People who do not think highly of themselves are more likely to be depressed because of this involuntary implicit learning.

Implicit cognition is another influential predictor for bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder. Research proposes patients with bipolar disorder show more common implicit and depressive self-referencing than unipolar patients. Implicit cognition plays a strong role for patients with both bipolar and unipolar disorder. These patients have dysfunctional self-schemata, which is viewed as vulnerability for potential illnesses. Patients who have this vulnerability usually do not seek mental assistance which can later become more problematic to treat. Bipolar disorder patients with low implicit self-esteem are more defensive. This is an unconscious reaction to be manic protective when they feel threatened in any way.
Since the growing research of implicit cognition is associated with abnormalities, researchers attempted to find a connection between implicit neuroticism and schizophrenia. Indeed, there was a correlation; participants with schizophrenia were high in implicit neuroticism and low in implicit extraversion when compared to people who were mentally healthy. Participants were given questionnaires that ask personality questions such as "I enjoy being the center of attention". Implicit cognition constitutes low levels of extraversion because these participants are known to avoid any coping. Schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals differ in associative representation pertaining to themselves in neuroticism features.  People who are schizophrenic develop an implicit learning, meaning they have an error free learning style so they never take feedback from anyone else.

Research on suicide can be a difficult process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated self-task was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might attempt suicide. This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to attempt suicide. The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to attempt suicide depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition may lead to a behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for attempting suicide because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.

==Task performed==
Implicit cognition is measured in different ways to find the most accurate outcomes. The task used for patients with anxiety disorders was a modified Stroop task to observe attention biases in anxiety. A participant's reaction time was measured by the reported color of each word. Participants would name the color for each risk relevant words and risk irrelevant words and depending on the color of each word might slow the reaction time. Colors like red were used to see if anxious participants would have a slower reaction time. These colors are known as aposematic implying a threat warning. Most studies used the Implicit Association Test which varies for each study. For example, implicit self-esteem can be tested by giving participants questionnaires that are self-referent.  These ask questions like "I am known to be suicidal".  Depending on the response of the participants, the researcher can assessed the current state for each participant. Patients that were rated high in suicide immediately received psychiatric treatment. According to these experiments implicit cognition may be a strong predictor for mental disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">'''Implicit leadership theory''' ('''ILT''') is a [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] of [[leadership]] developed by Robert Lord and colleagues.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics.'' New York, New York: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the idea that individuals create cognitive representations of the world, and use these preconceived notions to interpret their surroundings and control their [[Behavior|behaviors]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Schyns, B., &amp; Meindl, J. R. (2005). ''Implicit leadership theories: Essays and explorations.'' Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; ILT suggests that group members have implicit expectations and assumptions about the [[Personality|personal characteristics]], traits, and qualities that are inherent in a leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  These assumptions, termed implicit leadership theories or leader prototypes, guide an individual's [[Perception|perceptions]] and responses to leaders.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The term implicit is used because they are not outwardly stated and the term theory is used because it involves the generalization of past experiences to new experiences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ILTs allow individuals to identify leaders and aid them in responding appropriately to leaders in order to [[Conflict avoidance|avoid conflict]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Although ILTs vary between [[individual]]s, many overlap in terms of the task skills and relationship skills that leaders should possess in order to be successful.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In terms of task skills, most people seek a leader that is in control, determined, influential, and continuously involved in the group activities. When considering relationship skills, most people tend to prefer a leader who is caring, honest, open to new ideas, and interested in the group work.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In a study by Offermann, Kennedy, and Wirtz (1994), the content and factor structure variation of male and female ILTs were compared across three stimuli, being leaders, effective leaders, and supervisors. They found that eight factors of the ILTs were rather stable across all participants, between males and females, and across the three stimuli. These eight factors were [[charisma]], sensitivity, dedication, [[intelligence]], [[attractiveness]], [[masculinity]], [[tyranny]], and strength. The results from this study suggest that, although ILTs differ depending on the individual, this variation may be systematic and, at times, predictable.

== Biases ==

The [[social world]] is solely understood in terms of perceptions, thus people use these perceptions intuitively to effectively organize and guide [[social interactions]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; We observe the actions of other people, take note of their personal characteristics, compare them to our own ILTs, and make decisions regarding whether they make an appropriate or inappropriate leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Additionally, we use ILTs to evaluate the suitability and [[effectiveness]] of a group's leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, if you believe that a good leader exerts control over the group, you may focus on this specific characteristic. Consequently, [[bias]] can result from noting only the instances when the leader was or was not in control. In a study by Foti and Lord (1987), participants were shown a videotape of a leader-group interaction. The participants were told to report the behaviors that the leader had or had not performed. The results of this study indicated that people are quicker to respond, more accurate, and more confident when they are judging behaviors that are both part of their ILTs and performed by the leader, in comparison to behaviors that were part of their ILTs and were not performed by the leader. Since ILTs are implicit theories, meaning the individual is likely unaware of their biases, it is difficult for ineffective ILTs to be recognized and discarded.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, Offermann et al. (1994) found that masculinity was a stable ILT across participants, sex, and stimuli. However, males tend to be more [[autocratic]] and [[Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership|task-oriented]] in leadership style, while females tend to adopt a more [[Participative decision-making|participative]] and relationship-oriented style.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Consequently, females generally tend to make better leaders as they have a more collaborative approach. This bias would be difficult to correct, as people are typically not aware of their [[implicit assumption]]s.

Yellow cedar (''[[Cupressus nootkatensis]]'') is a culturally, economically and environmentally significant species to the Pacific Northwest and was used extensively by indigenous peoples throughout the region.

==History==
===Archaeological Evidence of Use===
At the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site]] in Washington, cedar (either yellow or red) wood, bark, and roots, along with the remains of cedar houses were found all dating between 300 and 500 years ago. On the east coast of Vancouver island at the Little Qualicum River site cedar (either yellow or red) rope, matting, and a canoe bailer were found dating to approximately 1000 years ago. At the Lachane site in Prince Rupert harbor many cedar (either yellow or red) wooden items and bark baskets were found dating to approximately 2000 years ago. At the Pitt River site near Vancouver two carved cedar (either yellow or red) items and baskets were found, dating to approximately 2900 years ago. At the Musqueam site near Vancouver cedar (either yellow or red) basketry, matting, ropes were found dating to 3000 years ago. At various other sites around Vancouver wood working tools have been found that date from between 5000 and 8000 years ago that could possibly have been intended to be used for cedar (either yellow or red).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends===
====[[Tlingit]]====
Natsilane was a great hunter and carver. He also hunted with respect for the sea lions he killed. His older brothers-in-law were jealous of his talents. One day when they had paddled far out to a sea lion rock to hunt, Natsilane speared a sea lion but it dove into the water breaking off the spear tip. When he looked back to the canoe, his older brothers-in-law were paddling away, against the protests of his youngest brother-in-law. Natsilane in despair went to sleep on the rock, and was awaked by the chief of the sea lions. He was brought to live in their village beneath the sea. It turned out that he had speared the sea lion chief's son, so Natsilane saved the boy by removing the spearhead from his side. In thanks, the sea lions sent him home in an inflated sealskin bladder. Once home, he visited his wife in secret and had her bring him his carving tools. He set about carving a killer whale, an animal that had yet to exist. First he tried spruce, but that sank when he placed it in a tide pool. Next, he tried hemlock, which also sank. He then tried red cedar, which circled, but then also came to rest on the bottom of the pool. Finally, he tried yellow cedar, his best carving yet. This jumped from the tide pool out to sea. He called the first killer whale back to him and told it to kill his older brothers-in-law when they next went in their canoe to hunt, but to save the youngest brother-in-law. The killer whale capsized the canoe, drowning the older brothers-in-law but brought the youngest back to shore on its back. When the killer whale returned, Natsilane instructed the whale to never again harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;Giraudo Beck 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caduto 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hesquiat====
Raven the trickster came upon three young women drying salmon on the beach. Being hungry, and interested in stealing their salmon he asked them if they were afraid of being alone. They answered no, so he asked if they were afraid of bears, to which they also answered no. He went through a long list of animals, all of which the young women said they were not afraid of until he mentioned owls. The women confessed they were very afraid of owls. Raven walked away and hid himself in some bushes nearby, where he began to mimic owl calls. The women were terrified, and ran up the mountainside. When they were halfway up and could run no more, they turned into yellow cedar trees. This is said to be why cedars are beautiful, growing silky bark like a woman's hair, graceful limbs, and why their young trunks are smooth to touch. This is also why they grow high on the slopes of Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood==
Yellow cedar's common name comes from the color of its wood, which is pale yellow. The wood is durable, fine grained, contains a natural preservative, and does not split as easily as red cedar, making it very suitable for carving.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also lightweight, pliable, yet strong, and was used to make paddles, fishing floats, rattles, ceremonial masks, speaker's staffs which were used as a badge of office for an announcer at events, bentwood bowls, totem poles, and longhouses. [[Bentwood]] boxes were made by using steam to bend a single plank of red cedar into four sides of a box, and then using yellow cedar pegs to join the corner. These boxes were highly prized and thus were a valuable trade item. They could be used to hold and store goods, or as coffins for the deceased. [[Salish peoples|Salish]] Hunters used yellow cedar saplings to make bows which were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;Huang, "Cedar."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a).jpg|thumb|Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a)]] [[File:Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01.jpg|thumb|Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01]]

===Harvesting===
Harvesting of trees was typically done from late summer to early spring. This was to avoid the time when the sap was up as it sped the rotting of the tree.

====Felling a Tree By Burning and Adzing====

A cavity was chiseled into the tree with an adze, and then red hot rocks were applied for controlled burning, with wet hemlock branches placed around the cavity to control the spread of the burn. The tree feller would chop away the charcoal, renewing the treatment of hot rocks as needed.

====Felling a Tree By Burning====

Fire was applied to the base of the tree. A ring of wet clay circled the tree above the fire to control burning.

====Felling a Tree With Hammer, Wedge, and Maul====

A scaffold and platform was built around the tree above the flaring roots. Two chiseled grooves about one foot apart were made around the tree and then the wood between cut away with a hammer and maul. The process was repeated until the tree fell.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

===Hammer===
The earliest form of the hammer used when carving yellow cedar was the hammer stone, a hard rock worn smooth by water that was resistant to cracking or flaking. Northern and Southern peoples later developed their own respective hammers. Southern peoples used the hand maul which was held directly in the hand, while northern nations ([[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tlingit]]) used hafted mauls, which were heavy stone heads lashed onto a long haft, similar to a sledge hammer. Many of the stone mauls were sculpted as animal figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedge===
Wedges when hammered were used to split cedar logs into planks. A variety of woods including yew, spruce, maple, and crabapple were used as wedges. The wood was beveled on one end to allow it to be driven into the cedar, and then scorched to improve its hardness. Animal fat was rubbed into the wood to prevent warping, and a cedar with was twisted around the top end to prevent splitting when struck with a hammer. Antler was also historically used as an alternative to wood wedges.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Adze]]===
The most universal adze was the elbow adze, named for its shape. Metal blades have been found on adzes for several hundred years, and currently very little evidence of stone blades usage exists. Elbow adzes were used for chopping and rough shaping, and were typically used on large works. D adzes were also used from Vancouver island southward. Their name comes from the shape of their haft, which were often carved to represent animals. The D adze was used for finer work and for finishing.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Tools===
Chisels, scrapers, knives, awls, and sandstones to keep the tools sharp were important additional components of a woodcarver's tool chest.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113).jpg|thumb|Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113)]]

==Bark==
The inner bark of yellow cedar was valued over the inner bark of red cedar because it is more durable.  The inner bark is very versatile and could be dyed and used as different types of thread to create mats, clothing, blankets, basketry, fishing nets, ropes, and hats, the bark is also soft and absorbent, and was used for diapers, sanitary napkins, and bedding as well.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; Yellow cedar was the only bark used for the core of the warp for [[Chilkat weaving]], due to its strength.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvesting===
Bark was cut and pulled as soon as the sap began to run, which varied regionally from late May to July.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; While carving was typically done by men, the harvesting of bark was performed by women. Straight young trees were chosen, and only a portion was debarked to ensure the tree's survival. Thousands of culturally modified trees with scars from past bark harvesting can now be found along the Pacific Northwest coastline.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; On the side with the fewest branches, above the flare of the tree's roots, a woman would make a horizontal cut the width of two fingers. She would make a small vertical cut then on either end of the horizontal cut. She would then use a small wedge to pry the bark away from the trunk enough for her to grip securely. Holding this end of the bark, she would then walk away from the tree slowly, drawing a ribbon of bark off the tree. For the bark quality to prove good for weaving, the strip should run at least twenty feet before narrowing to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
Roots could be dried and then braided to form cords for weaving hats or basketry. Using specific techniques, the baskets could be made water and heat proof, and could be used as cookware.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;

==Withes==
Withes were used to create strong cords for lashing and ropes. They were a valuable construction tool, and were often used in place nails or bolts. Because of their strength, they were also used to create burden baskets for heavy loads.

The '''Inland Waterways Commission''' was created by Congress in March 1907, at the request of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], to investigate the transportation crisis that recently had affected nation's ability to move its produce and industrial production efficiently.  The immediate crisis centered on insufficient railroad capacity developed by the private sector, and competing but neglected inland shipping, the navigation of which had been deemed under federal purview since 1824. The temporary commission lasted until the end of Roosevelt's presidency, but his conservationist [[Progressive Era|progressive]] interest was focused more than on transportation alone. The president wanted water projects to be considered for their multiple uses and in relation to other natural resources and asked for a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States.

Based on long-established legislative structure and more recent bureaucratic additions, the appointed members of the commission included, elected Representative [[Theodore E. Burton]] (R OH), as chairman, being also chair of the [[United States House Committee on Rivers and Harbors|House Committee on Rivers and Harbors]]; Senator [[Francis G. Newlands]] (D NV), as vice-chair; Senator [[William Warner (Missouri)|William Warner]] (R MO), and Senator [[John H. Bankhead]] (D AL).   Non-elected commissioners included government technocrats with experience in related fields, including [[Alexander Mackenzie (engineer)|Alexander Mackenzie]],  [[List of USACE Chiefs of Engineers|Chiefs of Engineers]], US Army, and the entity involved in federal navigation improvements since the beginning; [[William John McGee]], as secretary and from the [[United States Geological Survey]]; [[Frederick Haynes Newell]], the first Director of the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|United States Reclamation Service]]; [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], and Herbert Knox Smith, from the Bureau of Corporations and predecessor to the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

By the end of that year, after the commission had looked at shipping on the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]], a minority of its members concluded that the nation needed a comprehensive water resources policy along with an autonomous commission of experts to plan and construct water projects that embraced entire river basins. At the end of 1907, and before Roosevelt presented the commission's preliminary report to Congress in late February, Senator Newlands introduced the first bill to create a permanent commission.  Over the next decade the subject of [[hydroelectricity]] would be closely studied, while Newlands drafted several more bills, with only an emasculated version becoming law in 1917.   While supportive of the commission's report generally, most members of Congress considered Newlands's plan either impractical or unconstitutional. Three years later, Congress all but eliminated the hope of centralized water planning when it replaced the Inland Waterways Commission with the Federal Power Commission, following passage of the [[Federal Power Act|Federal Water Power Act of 1920]].&lt;ref name="PisIWCre"&gt;Donald J. Pisani, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v018/18.4pisani.html Water Planning in the Progressive Era: The Inland Waterways Commission Reconsidered], Journal of Policy History 18.4 (2006) pp.389-418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential charge==
On  March 14, 1907, President Roosevelt appointed the Inland Waterway Commissioners and charged them to prepare and report "a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-2-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Instrument of the President, March 14, 1907.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced he said, by broad considerations of national policy, and the corresponding responsibilities and obligations, since the control of navigable waterways lies within the federal purview. He noted that while private sector energies had been directed largely toward industrial development in connection with field and forest, coal and iron, some of these material and power resources may already be largely depleted or abused. At the same time, the government's inland waterways have received scant attention as a whole, and it was becoming clear that the nation's streams should be considered and conserved as great natural resources. So far, works designed to control the waterways have usually been undertaken for a single purpose in mind, such as the improvement of navigation, the development of power, the irrigation of arid lands, the protection of lowlands from floods, or to supply water for domestic and manufacturing purposes. While the people's rights to these and similar water uses must be respected, the time had come he said, for local projects and uses of the inland waters to be viewed in a more comprehensive plan, designed for the benefit of the entire country; such a plan should consider and include all the uses to which streams may be put, and should bring together and coordinate the points of view of all water users.  While the task involved in the full and orderly development and control of the nation's river systems is a great one, it is certainly not too great for the government to approach, especially with results which seem to promise even greater returns.

The Commission's appointment followed numerous petitions from commercial organizations in the Mississippi Valley asking for such study, and he said, "the common knowledge that the railroads of the United States are no longer able to move crops and manufactures rapidly enough to secure the prompt transaction of the business of the nation, and there is small prospect of immediate relief." During the previous ten years, while the production of the northern interior States had doubled, the railroad facilities to transport it had increased only about 12%; there was reason to doubt railroad development could keep transportation abreast of production in the near-term.  "There appears to be but one complete remedy — the development of a complementary system of transportation by water. The present congestion affects chiefly the people of the Mississippi Valley, and they demand relief. When the congestion of which they complain is relieved, the whole Nation will share the good results."&lt;ref name="PresChrg"/&gt;

Roosevelt noted that while the nation's rivers are natural resources of first rank, they are also liable to become destructive agencies, endangering life and property; and that some of our most notable engineering enterprises have grown from the effort to control them. The vast quantity of annual suspended sediment and an enormous but unmeasured amount of earth-salts and soil-matter carried in solution not only causes the Mississippi channels to clog and flood the lowlands of the lower river, but also renders the flow variable and difficult to control.  Furthermore, he noted, the sediment and soil-matter is composed of the most fertile material of the fields and pastures drained by the tributaries. "Any plan for utilizing our inland waterways should consider floods and their control by forests and other means; the protection of bottom-lands from injury by overflow, and up-lands from loss by soil-wash; the physics of sediment-charged waters and the physical or other ways of purifying them; the construction of dams and locks, not only to facilitate navigation but to control the character and movement of the waters; and should look to the full use and control of our running waters and the complete "artificialization" of our waterways for the benefit of citizens as a whole." Not being possible to properly frame so large a plan for the control of rivers without taking account of the orderly development of other natural resources, Roosevelt asked that the Inland Waterways Commission consider the relations of the streams to the use of all the great permanent natural resources and their conservation to make and maintain prosperous homes.

Roosevelt noted that any feasible plan for utilizing inland waterways should recognize both the existing federal means, including the Departments of War, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor, and those in the States and their subdivisions.  Also it must not involve unduly burdensome expenditures from the national Treasury.  The cost necessarily will be large and proportional to the magnitude of potential benefits to the people, but it will be small in comparison to the $17 billion in current capital investments for steam railways nationally. That amount would have seemed enormous and incredible a half a century earlier, yet that investment was a continuous source of profit to the people. Without it, the nation's industrial progress would have been impossible.  In closing the President said that, the questions before the Inland Waterways Commission must necessarily relate to every part of the United States and affect every interest within its borders. Its plans should be considered in light of the widest modern knowledge of the country and its people, and from the most diverse points of view. As the committee's work sufficiently advanced, he would add more consulting members to the Commission, and ask that its recommendations be fully discussed with him, before they were submitted. The Commission's report should include both a general statement of the problems, as well as recommendations concerning the manner and means of attacking the problems perceived by them.

==Proceedings==
After initial conference and correspondence the organizational meeting was held in Washington DC from April 29 to May 3, 1907. A second meeting and inspection trip on the Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Passes was held May 13 to May 23. A third meeting and inspection trip took place from September 21 to October 13, which traveled on the Great Lakes from Cleveland to Duluth, on the Mississippi from St. Paul to Memphis, and on the Missouri River from Kansas City to St. Louis. A fourth meeting was held in the capitol beginning on November 25, for the purpose of preparing a preliminary report; the commission ended February 3, 1908.

During the organizational and inspecting meetings, thirty formal sessions were held in addition to informal meetings and conferences. At several of these sessions the entire Commission were present; at no session were there fewer than five Commissioners; the average attendance was over seven. During the meetings for report preparation there were 27 sessions, with an average attendance of seven.  Experts on matters entrusted to the Commission were present by invitation at 24 sessions; of these experts there were 24, several of whom attended two or more sessions, with most being former or current attaches of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].  Outside formal sessions, the Commissioners devoted much time to the consideration of the waterways and related matters. Two or three Commissioners jointly inspected the upper Missouri, the Columbia and Snake, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, and major tributaries; several Commissioners employed agencies under their direction in collating and digesting data relating to canals, water transportation, etc. Most of the Commissioners attended conventions and other meetings connected with the development of waterways and related interests.

At the 18th session a special committee of one, Gen. Alexander MacKenzie, was appointed to prepare a list of statutes and considerations relating to [[water power]], especially generation of [[hydroelectricity]]. Following action at the 23rd session, with the President presiding, a letter requesting a conference on the conservation of natural resources was framed and presented to the President on October 4, 1907; this later resulted in the first [[Conference of Governors]].  At the twenty-fifth session a committee of three was appointed to communicate further with the President on this matter, and to prepare a preliminary draft of their report; both committees reported at the fourth meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-3-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission], Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission report==
The investigations and discussions of the Inland Waterways Commission resulted in a series of 'Findings', containing their statements of fact connected with navigation and other uses of the inland waterways nationally, 'Recommendations', containing their conclusions on those findings, 'Inquiries in progress', containing certain matters still under discussion and an extensive 'Appendix'.

The ICG is a research institute at the [[University of Portsmouth]] devoted to topics in [[cosmology]], [[galaxy evolution]] and [[gravitation]]. It has nearly 50 staff, post-docs and students working on subjects from [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] in the [[Early universe|early Universe]] to understanding the [[stellar populations]] in [[galaxies]].

Research at the Institute is supported by grants from STFC (the UK [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]]), the [[Royal Society]] and the [[European Union]].

==History==

The Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, or ICG,  was established as an independent research department by the University of Portsmouth in January 2002. It was formed from members of the Relativity and Cosmology Group that had been set up by Prof David Matravers, head of the School of Mathematical Studies at the [[University of Portsmouth]], following the arrival of Roy Maartens as a lecturer in 1994. [[David Wands]] joined the group as a research fellow in 1996. 

The group won their first major research grant from PPARC (the UK [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]]) in 1998 to study the evolution of cosmological structure. In the UK [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in 2001 (RAE2001) research submitted by the group was awarded a grade 5,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/&lt;/ref&gt; recognising the international excellence of their work in applied mathematics, and leading to the establishment of the ICG the next year. Bob Nichol joined the ICG from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (Pittsburgh) in 2004 initiating a research programme in [[observational cosmology]]. 

In the 2008 UK government Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008), 75% of the ICG research was judged to be "Internationally Excellent" or better (3* or 4* status, with 4* being the highest).

'''Liebig's law of the minimum''', often simply called '''Liebig's law''' or the '''law of the minimum''', is a principle developed in [[agricultural science]] by [[Carl Sprengel]] (1828) and later popularized by [[Justus von Liebig]]. It states that [[wiktionary:growth|growth]] is dictated not by total [[Resource (biology)|resources]] available, but by the scarcest resource ([[limiting factor]]). The law has also been applied to biological [[population]]s and [[ecosystem model]]s for factors such as [[sunlight]] or [[macronutrient (ecology)|mineral nutrients]].

== Applications ==
This concept was originally applied to [[plant]] or [[agriculture|crop]] growth, where it was found that increasing the amount of plentiful [[nutrient]]s did not increase plant growth. Only by increasing the amount of the limiting nutrient (the one most scarce in relation to "need") was the growth of a plant or crop improved. This principle can be summed up in the aphorism, "The availability of the most abundant nutrient in the soil is only as good as the availability of the least abundant nutrient in the soil." Or, to put it more plainly, "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link."

=== Scientific applications ===
Liebig's law has been extended to biological [[population]]s (and is commonly used in [[ecosystem model|ecosystem modelling]]). For example, the growth of an organism such as a plant may be dependent on a number of different factors, such as [[sunlight]] or [[macronutrient (ecology)|mineral nutrients]] (e.g., [[nitrate]] or [[phosphate]]). The availability of these may vary, such that at any given time one is more limiting than the others. Liebig's law states that growth only occurs at the rate permitted by the most limiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9619&amp;page=R1|title=Plants and Population: is there time?|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|year=1999|series=Colloquium|location=Washington DC|chapter=Limits to Crop Yield|first1=Thomas R.|last1=Sinclair|chapterurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703111853/http://146.186.172.254/nas/Panelists/Sinclair%20Comments.html|editor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in the equation below, the growth of population &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the minimum of three [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]] terms representing limitation by factors &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dO}{dt} = O\left(\min \left( \frac{\mu_I I}{k_{I} + I}, \frac{\mu_N N}{k_{N} + N}, \frac{\mu_P P}{k_{P} + P} \right) -m\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The use of the equation is limited to a situation where there are steady state [[ceteris paribus]] conditions, and factor interactions are tightly controlled.

===Protein nutrition===
In [[human nutrition]], the law of the minimum was used by [[William Cumming Rose]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s. In 1931 he published his study "Feeding experiments with mixtures of highly refined amino acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.C. Rose (1931) [http://www.jbc.org/content/94/1/155.full.pdf Feeding Experiments], [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] 94: 155–65&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the essential amino acids has enabled [[vegetarian]]s to enhance their [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition by [[protein combining]] from various vegetable sources. One practitioner was [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] fighting protein deficiency in India and Guatemala. [[Francis Moore Lappe]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' in 1971 which popularized protein combining using grains, legumes, and dairy products.

=== Other applications ===
More recently Liebig's law is starting to find an application in [[natural resource management]] where it surmises that growth in markets dependent upon [[natural resource]] inputs is restricted by the most limited input. As the [[natural capital]] upon which growth depends is limited in supply due to the [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] nature of the planet, Liebig's law encourages scientists and natural resource managers to calculate the scarcity of essential resources in order to allow for a multi-generational approach to [[resource consumption]].

Neoclassical economic theory has sought to refute the issue of resource scarcity by application of the [[substitute good|law of substitutability]] and [[technological innovation]]. The substitutability "law" states that as one resource is exhausted—and prices rise due to a lack of surplus—new markets based on alternative resources appear at certain prices in order to satisfy demand. Technological innovation implies that humans are able to use technology to fill the gaps in situations where resources are [[substitute good|imperfectly substitutable]].

A market-based theory depends on proper pricing. Where resources such as clean air and water are not accounted for, there will be a "market failure". These failures may be addressed with [[Pigovian tax]]es and subsidies, such as a carbon tax. While the theory of the law of substitutability is a useful rule of thumb, some resources may be so fundamental that there exist no substitutes. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]] noted, "We may be able to substitute nuclear power for coal power, and plastics for wood ... but for phosphorus there is neither substitute nor replacement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asimov|first1=Issac|title=Fact and Fancy| date=1962|publisher=Doubleday|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.th/books/about/Fact_and_Fancy.html?id=FbbaAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|chapter=Life's Bottleneck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where no substitutes exist, such as phosphorus, recycling will be necessary. This may require careful long-term planning and governmental intervention, in part to create Pigovian taxes to allow efficient market allocation of resources, in part to address other market failures such as excessive time discounting.

== Liebig's barrel ==
[[File:Minimum-Tonne.svg|thumb|Liebig's barrel]]
Dobenecks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.R. |last1=Whitson |first2=H.L. |last2=Walster |title=Soils and soil fertility |publisher=Webb  |location=St. Paul, MN |year=1912 |oclc=1593332 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SguAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AJ2lm1K7DxBIC&amp;q=Dobenecks#search_anchor |quote=100. Illustration of Limiting Factors. The accompanying illustration devised by Dr. Dobenecks is intended to illustrate this principle of limiting factors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the image of a barrel—often called "Liebig's barrel"—to explain Liebig's law. Just as the capacity of a barrel with staves of unequal length is limited by the shortest stave, so a plant's growth is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply.

If a system satisfies the law of the minimum then adaptation will equalize the load of different factors because the adaptation resource will be allocated for compensation of limitation.&lt;ref name="GorbanLiebig2010"&gt;A.N. Gorban, L.I. Pokidysheva, E.V. Smirnova, T.A. Tyukina. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47816112_Law_of_the_Minimum_Paradoxes Law of the Minimum Paradoxes], Bull Math Biol 73(9) (2011), 2013–2044&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptation systems act as the [[wikt:cooper|cooper]] of Liebig's barrel and lengthens the shortest stave to improve barrel capacity. Indeed, in well-adapted systems the limiting factor should be compensated as far as possible. This observation follows the concept of resource competition and fitness maximization.&lt;ref&gt;D. Tilman, ''Resource Competition and Community Structure'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the law of the minimum paradoxes, if we observe the Law of the Minimum in artificial systems, then under natural conditions adaptation will equalize the load of different factors and we can expect a violation of the law of the minimum. Inversely, if artificial systems demonstrate significant violation of the law of the minimum, then we can expect that under natural conditions adaptation will compensate this violation. In a limited system life will adjust as an [[evolution]] of what came before.&lt;ref name="GorbanLiebig2010"/&gt;

== Biotechnology ==

One example of technological innovation is in [[plant genetics]] whereby the biological characteristics of species can be changed by employing [[genetic modification]] to alter biological dependence on the most limiting resource. [[Biotechnological]] innovations are thus able to extend the limits for growth in species by an increment until a new limiting factor is established, which can then be challenged through technological innovation.

Theoretically there is no limit to the number of possible increments towards an unknown productivity limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.M. |last1=Reilly |first2=K.O. |last2=Fuglie |title=Future yield growth in field crops: what evidence exists? |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=47 |issue=3–4 |pages=275–290 |date=6 July 1998 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(98)00116-0 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198798001160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be either the point where the increment to be advanced is so small it cannot be justified economically or where technology meets an invulnerable natural barrier. It may be worth adding that biotechnology itself is totally dependent on external sources of [[natural capital]].

[[Image:LTP exemplar.jpg|thumb|300px|Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in [[synaptic strength]] following high-frequency stimulation of a [[chemical synapse]]. Studies of LTP are often carried out in slices of the [[hippocampus]], an important organ for learning and memory. In such studies, electrical recordings are made from cells and plotted in a graph such as this one. This graph compares the response to stimuli in synapses that have undergone LTP versus synapses that have not undergone LTP. Synapses that have undergone LTP tend to have stronger electrical responses to stimuli than other synapses. The term ''long-term potentiation'' comes from the fact that this increase in [[synaptic strength]], or ''potentiation'', lasts a very long time compared to other processes that affect synaptic strength.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-6003-8"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Paradiso, Michael A. |author2=Bear, Mark F. |author3=Connors, Barry W. |title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |page=718 |isbn=0-7817-6003-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[neuroscience]], '''long-term potentiation''' ('''LTP''') is a persistent strengthening of [[synapse]]s based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="cooke"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooke SF, Bliss TV |title=Plasticity in the human central nervous system |journal=Brain |volume=129 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1659–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16672292 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of LTP is [[long-term depression]], which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.

It is one of several phenomena underlying [[synaptic plasticity]], the ability of [[chemical synapse]]s to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of [[synaptic strength]],&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss TV, Collingridge GL |title=A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus |journal=Nature |volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=31–39 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8421494 |doi=10.1038/361031a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies [[learning]] and [[memory]].&lt;ref name="cooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bliss"/&gt;

LTP was discovered in the rabbit [[hippocampus]] by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of [[clinical research]], for example, in the areas of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[addiction medicine]].

==History==

===Early theories of learning===
[[File:Cajal-Restored.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 19th century neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] proposed that memories might be stored across [[synapse]]s, the junctions between neurons that allow for their communication.]]

At the end of the 19th century, scientists generally recognized that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams RW, Herrup K |title=The control of neuron number |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=11 |issue= 1|pages=423–53 |year=1988 |url=http://www.nervenet.org/papers/NUMBER_REV_1988.html |pmid=3284447 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.002231}}&lt;/ref&gt;) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production.&lt;ref name="cajal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramón y Cajal, Santiago | title = The Croonian Lecture: La Fine Structure des Centres Nerveux | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | volume = 55 | issue = 331-335 | pages = 444–468 | year = 1894 | doi = 10.1098/rspl.1894.0063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.

The [[Spain|Spanish]] neuroanatomist [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] was among the first to suggest a mechanism of learning that did not require the formation of new neurons. In his 1894 [[Croonian Lecture]], he proposed that memories might instead be formed by strengthening the connections between existing neurons to improve the effectiveness of their communication.&lt;ref name="cajal"/&gt; [[Hebbian theory]], introduced by [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]] in 1949, echoed Ramón y Cajal's ideas, further proposing that cells may grow new connections or undergo metabolic changes that enhance their ability to communicate:

{{quote|Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or "trace") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability.... When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hebb, D. O. | title=Organization of Behavior: a Neuropsychological Theory  | location=New York | publisher=John Wiley | year=1949 | isbn=0-471-36727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though these theories of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not equipped with the [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, at about the same time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.

===Discovery===
[[Image:Hippocampus.png|thumb|right|200px|LTP was first discovered in the rabbit [[hippocampus]]. In humans, the hippocampus is located in the medial [[temporal lobe]].

LTP was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 in the [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], laboratory of [[Per Andersen]].&lt;ref name="lomo"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Terje Lømo | title=The discovery of long-term potentiation | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume=358 | issue=1432 | year=2003 | pages=617–20 |pmid=12740104 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1226 | pmc=1693150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=68 |issue=Suppl 277 |pages=128 |last=Lømo |first=Terje |title=Frequency potentiation of excitatory synaptic activity in the dentate area of the hippocampal formation |journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Lømo conducted a series of [[electrophysiology|neurophysiological]] experiments on [[anesthesia|anesthetized]] rabbits to explore the role of the hippocampus in [[short-term memory]].

Lømo's experiments focused on connections, or synapses, from the [[perforant pathway]] to the [[dentate gyrus]]. These experiments were carried out by stimulating presynaptic fibers of the perforant pathway and recording responses from a collection of postsynaptic cells of the dentate gyrus. As expected, a single pulse of electrical stimulation to fibers of the perforant pathway caused [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s (EPSPs) in cells of the dentate gyrus. What Lømo unexpectedly observed was that the postsynaptic cells' response to these single-pulse stimuli could be enhanced for a long period of time if he first delivered a [[tetanic stimulation|high-frequency train of stimuli]] to the presynaptic fibers. When such a train of stimuli was applied, subsequent single-pulse stimuli elicited stronger, prolonged EPSPs in the postsynaptic cell population. This phenomenon, whereby a high-frequency stimulus could produce a long-lived enhancement in the postsynaptic cells' response to subsequent single-pulse stimuli, was initially called "long-lasting potentiation".&lt;ref name="bliss_lomo"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Lømo T |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the anaesthetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J Physiol |volume=232 |issue=2 |pages=331–56 |year=1973 |pmid=4727084 |pmc=1350458 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1973.sp010273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bliss_g-m"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Gardner-Medwin A |title=Long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the dentate area of the unanaestetized rabbit following stimulation of the perforant path |journal=J.

The physical and biological mechanism of LTP is still not understood, but some successful models have been developed.[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_synaptic_plasticity] Studies of [[Dendritic spines#Modeling|dendritic spines]], protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract over the course of minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the [[electrical resistance]] of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as [[BCM Theory]], which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to [[NMDA receptor]] [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage gates]], have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional ''a priori'' [[Hebbian learning]] model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Types==
Since its original discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP has been observed in a variety of other neural structures, including the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]], [[amygdala]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clugnet |first=MC |author2=LeDoux JE  |title=Synaptic plasticity in fear conditioning circuits: induction of LTP in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala by stimulation of the medial geniculate body. |journal=J Neurosci |volume=10 |pages=2818–24 |pmid=2388089 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/10/8/2818 |format=PDF |issue=8 |date=1 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.&lt;ref name="riches"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malenka R, Bear M |title=LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=5–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15450156 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different areas of the brain exhibit different forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus.&lt;ref name="developmental-switch"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasuda H, Barth A, Stellwagen D, Malenka R |title=A developmental switch in the signaling cascades for LTP induction |journal=Nat Neurosci |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=15–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12469130 |doi=10.1038/nn985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the [[NMDA receptor]], others may depend upon the [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]] (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the [[Schaffer collateral]] pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the [[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|mossy fiber]] pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris E, Cotman C |title=Long-term potentiation of guinea pig mossy fiber responses is not blocked by N-methyl D-aspartate antagonists |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=132–7 |year=1986 |pmid=3022192 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(86)90451-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre- and postsynaptic activity required to induce LTP are other criteria by which LTP is classified. Broadly, this allows classification of LTP into Hebbian, non-Hebbian, and anti-Hebbian mechanisms. Borrowing its name from [[Hebb's postulate]], summarized by the maxim that "cells that fire together wire together," '''Hebbian LTP''' requires simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic depolarization for its induction.&lt;ref name="pmid2883309"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wigström H, Gustafsson B |title=Postsynaptic control of hippocampal long-term potentiation |journal=J.

Owing to its predictable organization and readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus has become the prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP,&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; and is therefore the focus of this article.

==Properties==
NMDA receptor-dependent LTP exhibits several properties, including input specificity, associativity, cooperativity, and persistence.

; Input specificity
: Once induced, LTP at one synapse does not spread to other synapses; rather LTP is ''input specific''. Long-term potentiation is only propagated to those synapses according to the rules of associativity and cooperativity. However, the input specificity of LTP may be incomplete at short distances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}  One model to explain the input specificity of LTP was presented by Frey and Morris in 1997 and is called the [[synaptic tagging|synaptic tagging and capture]] hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

; Associativity
: ''Associativity'' refers to the observation that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

; Cooperativity
: LTP can be induced either by strong [[tetanic stimulation]] of a single pathway to a synapse, or ''cooperatively'' via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.&lt;ref name="pmid12740107"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNaughton BL |title=Long-term potentiation, cooperativity and Hebb's cell assemblies: a personal history |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=629–34 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12740107 |pmc=1693161 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1231 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=358&amp;issue=1432&amp;spage=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Persistence
: LTP is ''persistent'', lasting from several minutes to many months, and it is this persistence that separates LTP from other forms of [[synaptic plasticity]].&lt;ref name="abraham"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abraham WC |title=How long will long-term potentiation last? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=735–44 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12740120 |pmc=1693170 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1222 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12740120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early phase===
[[Image:Early LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early phase of LTP, one model of which is shown here, is independent of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynch M |title=Long-term potentiation and memory |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=87–136 |year=2004 |pmid=14715912 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/84/1/87 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00014.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:CaMKII-dodecameric.png|thumb|200px|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) appears to be an important mediator of the early, protein synthesis-independent phase of LTP.]]

====Maintenance====
While induction entails the ''transient'' activation of [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|CaMKII]] and [[protein kinase C|PKC]], maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) is characterized by their ''persistent'' activation. During this stage, PKMz ([[Protein kinase Mζ]]) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, they are able to carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt;

====Expression====
[[Phosphorylation]] is a chemical reaction in which a small [[phosphate]] group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation to carry out the two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing [[AMPA receptor]]s to increase their activity.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malinow R |title=AMPA receptor trafficking and long-term potentiation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=707–14 |year=2003 |pmid=12740116 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1233 |pmc=1693162}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.

While the above model of E-LTP describes entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically.&lt;ref name="emptage"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Emptage N, Reid C, Fine A, Bliss T |title=Optical quantal analysis reveals a presynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal Schaffer-associational synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=797–804 |year=2003 |pmid=12797963 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WSS-4C5XN9K-G&amp;_coverDate=06%2F05%2F2003&amp;_alid=523934887&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=7054&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15f6a55d9b53d2265077f3a74a8a495a |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00325-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII activity in the postsynaptic cell during E-LTP may lead to the synthesis of a "retrograde messenger", discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in [[Early long-term potentiation|early LTP]], the retrograde messenger may also play a role in the expression of late LTP.

===Late phase===
[[Image:Late LTP mechanism.png|right|thumb|200px|The early and late phases of LTP are thought to communicate via the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK).&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;]]

Late LTP (L-LTP) is the natural extension of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires [[gene transcription]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Frey S, Schollmeier F, Krug M |title=Influence of actinomycin D, a RNA synthesis inhibitor, on long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro |journal=J Physiol |volume=(Pt 3) |issue= Pt 3 |series=490|pages=703–11 |date=1 January 1996|pmid=8683469 |pmc=1158708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Krug M, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=Anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocks late phases of LTP phenomena in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro |journal=Brain Res |volume=452 |issue=1-2 |pages=57–65 |year=1988 |pmid=3401749 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(88)90008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.

====Induction====
Late LTP is induced by changes in [[gene expression]] and [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] brought about by the persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; In fact, MAPK—specifically the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for [[cAMP response element binding protein]] (CREB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kovács KA, Steullet P, Steinmann M, Do KQ, Magistretti PJ, Halfon O, Cardinaux JR |title=TORC1 is a calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detector involved in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity. |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue= 11 |pages= 4700–5 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17360587 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0607524104  | pmc=1838663}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.

====Maintenance====
Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include [[transcription factor]]s such as CREB.&lt;ref name="sweatt-kinases"/&gt; ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be [[protein kinase Mζ]] (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction.&lt;ref name="PKMz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Serrano P, Yao Y, Sacktor T |title=Persistent phosphorylation by protein kinase Mzeta maintains late-phase long-term potentiation |journal=J Neurosci |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1979–84 |year=2005  |pmid=15728837 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5132-04.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pastalkova E, Serrano P, Pinkhasova D, Wallace E, Fenton A, Sacktor T |title=Storage of spatial information by the maintenance mechanism of LTP |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1141–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16931766 |doi=10.1126/science.1128657}}&lt;/ref&gt; PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active not just in the first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of [[long-term memory]]. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in [[retrograde amnesia]] with intact [[short-term memory]]; PKMζ does not play a role in the establishment of short-term memory.&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/&gt; PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PKMz-maintenance"/&gt; by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP.&lt;ref name="PKMz"/&gt; Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volk|first=Lenora J.|author2=Bachman, Julia L. |author3=Johnson, Richard |author4=Yu, Yilin |author5= Huganir, Richard L. |title=PKM-ζ is not required for hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning and memory|journal=Nature|date=2 January 2013|volume=493|issue=7432|pages=420–423|doi=10.1038/nature11802|pmid=23283174|pmc=3830948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as [[Bouton (synapse)|axonal bouton]], [[dendritic spine]] and [[postsynaptic density]].&lt;ref name="stabilization_plasticity"&gt;
{{cite journal

On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins [[PSD-95]] and [[HOMER1|Homer1c]] has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.&lt;ref name="stabilization_plasticity" /&gt;

====Expression====
The identities of only a few proteins synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in [[dendritic spine]] number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of [[synaptotagmin]] and an increase in [[synaptic vesicle]] number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.

Even in studies restricted to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined the location of the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic [[cell body]] or in its [[dendrite]]s.&lt;ref name="translation"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelleher R, Govindarajan A, Tonegawa S |title=Translational regulatory mechanisms in persistent forms of synaptic plasticity |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=59–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15450160 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having observed [[ribosome]]s (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kang H, Schuman E |title=A requirement for local protein synthesis in neurotrophin-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5280 |pages=1402–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8703078 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5280.1402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steward O, Worley P |title=A cellular mechanism for targeting newly synthesized mRNAs to synaptic sites on dendrites |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=98 |issue=13 |pages=7062–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11416188 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/13/7062 |doi=10.1073/pnas.131146398 |pmc=34623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the popularity of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt; Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.

===Retrograde signaling===
{{main article|Retrograde signaling in LTP}}

Retrograde signaling is a hypothesis that attempts to explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence suggests that it is expressed presynaptically as well.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emptage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlidis P, Montgomery J, Madison D |title=Presynaptic protein kinase activity supports long-term potentiation at synapses between individual hippocampal neurons |journal=J Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=4497–505 |year=2000 |pmid=10844019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis gets its name because normal [[synaptic transmission]] is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a ''retrograde'' (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of [[neurotransmitter vesicle]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zakharenko S, Patterson S, Dragatsis I, Zeitlin S, Siegelbaum S, Kandel E, Morozov A |title=Presynaptic BDNF required for a presynaptic but not postsynaptic component of LTP at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses |journal=Neuron |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=975–90 |year=2003 |pmid=12971897 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00543-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrograde signaling is currently a contentious subject as some investigators do not believe the presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt; Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on [[nitric oxide]], while most recent evidence points to [[cell adhesion]] proteins.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;

===Synaptic tagging===
Before the local protein synthesis hypothesis gained significant support, there was general agreement that the protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.

The synaptic tagging hypothesis proposes that a "synaptic tag" is synthesized at synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli, and that this synaptic tag may serve to capture plasticity-related proteins shipped cell-wide from the cell body.&lt;ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Morris R |title=Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6616 |pages=533–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9020359 |doi=10.1038/385533a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of LTP in the [[Nudibranch|marine snail]] ''[[Aplysia californica]]'' have implicated synaptic tagging as a mechanism for the input-specificity of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin K, Casadio A, Zhu H, Yaping E, Rose J, Chen M, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=Synapse-specific, long-term facilitation of aplysia sensory to motor synapses: a function for local protein synthesis in memory storage |journal=Cell |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=927–38 |year=1997 |pmid=9428516 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80484-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casadio A, Martin K, Giustetto M, Zhu H, Chen M, Bartsch D, Bailey C, Kandel E |title=A transient, neuron-wide form of CREB-mediated long-term facilitation can be stabilized at specific synapses by local protein synthesis |journal=Cell |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=221–37 |year=1999 |pmid=10535740 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81653-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that given two widely separated synapses, an LTP-inducing stimulus at one synapse drives several signaling cascades (described previously) that initiates gene expression in the cell nucleus. At the same synapse (but not the unstimulated synapse), local protein synthesis creates a short-lived (less than three hours) synaptic tag.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="frey-synaptic_tagging" /&gt;--&gt; The products of gene expression are shipped globally throughout the cell, but are only captured by synapses that express the synaptic tag. Thus only the synapse receiving LTP-inducing stimuli is potentiated, demonstrating LTP's input specificity.

The synaptic tag hypothesis may also account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (''see [[#Properties|Properties]]'') is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas one might expect only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), ''both'' synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.

Cooperativity is observed when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging does not explain how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.

===Modulation===

As described previously, the molecules that underlie LTP can be classified as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.&lt;ref name="riches"/&gt;

In addition to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered by a variety of modulators. For example, the [[steroid hormone]] [[estradiol]] may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent [[dendritic spine]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Segal M, Murphy D |title=CREB activation mediates plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons |journal=Neural Plast |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=9920677 |doi=10.1155/NP.1998.1 |pmc=2565317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[β-adrenergic receptor]] agonists such as [[norepinephrine]] may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Straube T, Frey J |title=Involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in protein synthesis-dependent late long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats: the critical role of the LTP induction strength |journal=Neuroscience |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=473–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12770561 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitric oxide synthase]] activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu Y, Kandel E, Hawkins R |title=Nitric oxide signaling contributes to late-phase LTP and CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus |journal=J Neurosci |volume=19 |issue=23 |pages=10250–61 |year=1999 |pmid=10575022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, activation of [[dopamine receptor]]s may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frey U, Matthies H, Reymann K, Matthies H |title=The effect of dopaminergic D1 receptor blockade during tetanization on the expression of long-term potentiation in the rat CA1 region in vitro |journal=Neurosci Lett |volume=129 |issue=1 |pages=111–4 |year=1991 |pmid=1833673 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(91)90732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Otmakhova N, Lisman J |title=D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses |journal=J Neurosci |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=7478–86 |year=1996 |pmid=8922403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to behavioral memory==
While the long-term potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems to provide an elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning at the level of the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from ''in vitro'' studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in [[Fear processing in the brain|fear processing]].

===Spatial memory===
[[Image:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Morris water maze]] task has been used to demonstrate the necessity of NMDA receptors in establishing [[spatial memory|spatial memories]].]]

In 1986, Richard Morris provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris R, Anderson E, Lynch G, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411 |doi=10.1038/319774a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested the [[spatial memory]] of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the [[Morris water maze]], a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker [[APV (NMDAR antagonist)|APV]], while the other group served as the [[control group|control]]. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.

Similarly, [[Susumu Tonegawa]] demonstrated in 1996 that the CA1 area of the hippocampus is crucial to the formation of spatial memories in living mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McHugh T, Blum K, Tsien J, Tonegawa S, Wilson M |title=Impaired hippocampal representation of space in CA1-specific NMDAR1 knockout mice |journal=Cell |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=1339–49 |year=1996 |pmid=8980239 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81828-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called ''[[place cell]]s'' located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a ''place field'' — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.

===Inhibitory avoidance===
In 2006, [[Jonathan Whitlock]] and colleagues reported on a series of experiments that provided perhaps the strongest evidence of LTP's role in behavioral memory, arguing that to conclude that LTP underlies behavioral learning, the two processes must both mimic and occlude one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitlock J, Heynen A, Shuler M, Bear M |title=Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1093–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16931756 |doi=10.1126/science.1128134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employing an inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, researchers trained rats in a two-chambered apparatus with light and dark chambers, the latter being fitted with a device that delivered a foot shock to the rat upon entry. An analysis of CA1 hippocampal synapses revealed that inhibitory avoidance training induced ''in vivo'' AMPA receptor phosphorylation of the same type as that seen in LTP ''in vitro''; that is, inhibitory avoidance training mimicked LTP. In addition, synapses potentiated during training could not be further potentiated by experimental manipulations that would have otherwise induced LTP; that is, inhibitory avoidance training occluded LTP. In a response to the article, Timothy Bliss and colleagues remarked that these and related experiments "substantially advance the case for LTP as a neural mechanism for memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bliss T, Collingridge G, Laroche S |title=Neuroscience. ZAP and ZIP, a story to forget |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1058–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16931746 |doi=10.1126/science.1132538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
The role of LTP in disease is less clear than its role in basic mechanisms of [[synaptic plasticity]]. However, alterations in LTP may contribute to a number of [[neurological disease]]s, including [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[epilepsy]], and [[neuropathic pain]].&lt;ref name="cooke-clinical"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooke SF, Bliss TV |title=Plasticity in the human central nervous system |journal=Brain |volume=129 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1659–73 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16672292 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl082 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16672292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired LTP may also have a role in [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[drug addiction]].

===Alzheimer's disease===
[[Image:APP and LTP in Alzheimer disease.png|thumb|150px|Misprocessing of [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP) in [[Alzheimer's disease]] disrupts LTP and is thought to lead to early cognitive decline in individuals with the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid12740129"/&gt;]]

LTP has received much attention among those who study [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), a [[neurodegenerative disease]] that causes marked cognitive decline and [[dementia]]. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other [[medial temporal lobe]] structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, some have suggested that the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.

In a 2003 review of the literature, Rowan ''et al.'' proposed one model for how LTP might be affected in AD.&lt;ref name="pmid12740129"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowan MJ, Klyubin I, Cullen WK, Anwyl R |title=Synaptic plasticity in animal models of early Alzheimer's disease |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=358 |issue=1432 |pages=821–8 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12740129 |pmc=1693153 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1240 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=358&amp;issue=1432&amp;spage=821}}&lt;/ref&gt; AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called [[amyloid β]] (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and may lead to the cognitive decline seen early in AD.

AD may also impair LTP through mechanisms distinct from Aβ. For example, one study demonstrated that the enzyme PKMζ accumulates in [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s, which are a pathologic marker of AD. PKMζ is an enzyme with critical importance in the [[#Maintenance 2|maintenance of late LTP]].&lt;ref name="pmid16691113"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crary JF, Shao CY, Mirra SS, Hernandez AI, Sacktor TC |title=Atypical protein kinase C in neurodegenerative disease I: PKMzeta aggregates with limbic neurofibrillary tangles and AMPA receptors in Alzheimer disease |journal=Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=319–26 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16691113 |doi=10.1097/01.jnen.0000218442.07664.04 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00005072-200604000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug addiction===
Research in the field of [[addiction medicine]] has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that [[drug addiction]] represents a powerful form of learning and memory.&lt;ref name="pmid17948030"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kauer JA, Malenka RC |title=Synaptic plasticity and addiction |journal=Nature Reviews.

Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP&lt;ref name="pmid17948030"/&gt; and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.&lt;ref name="pmid14993438"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf ME |title=LTP may trigger addiction |journal=Molecular interventions |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=248–52 |date=August 2003 |pmid=14993438 |doi=10.1124/mi.3.5.248 |url=http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14993438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Economics''' is  a [[postgraduate]] '''[[master's degree]] in [[economics]]''' ('''M.Econ.''', '''M.Ec.'''; also [[Master of Science|MS]] in Economics, [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Economics, [[Master of Commerce|MCom]] in Economics) comprising training in economic theory, [[econometrics]] and / or [[applied economics]].

==Overview==
The degree may be offered as a [[terminal degree]] or as additional preparation for [[doctorate|doctoral study]], and is sometimes offered as a [[professional degree]], such as the  emerging  degree, ''M.P.S. in Applied Economics''. The program emphases and curricula will differ correspondingly.  The course of study for the master's degree lasts from one to two years. A [[thesis]] is often required, particularly for terminal degrees.

Many universities (in the United States) do not offer the master's degree directly; rather, the degree is routinely awarded as a [[Doctor of Philosophy#Master's degree "en route"|master's degree "en route"]], after completion of a designated phase of the [[Ph.D.]] program in economics. 

Typically, the [[curriculum]] is structured around [[Core curriculum|core topics]], with any optional [[coursework]] [[wikt:complementary|complementary]] to the program focus. The core modules are usually in [[Microeconomics|microeconomic theory]], [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic theory]] and [[econometrics]]. Theory-focused degrees will tend to cover these more mathematically, and emphasize econometric theory as opposed to econometric techniques and [[Statistical packages|software]]; these will also require a separate course in [[mathematical economics]]. Note though that regardless of focus, most programs "now place a marked emphasis on the primacy of mathematics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Masters degrees in economics: How to be a leader of the future|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/masters-degrees-in-economics-how-to-be-a-leader-of-the-future-482394.html|newspaper=The Independent | location=London|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many universities thus also require [[Business_mathematics#Postgraduate|"quantitative techniques"]], especially where mathematical economics is not a core course. Some (doctoral) programs include core work in [[economic history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Econ Grad School|url=http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|publisher=Davidson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528031938/http://www.davidson.edu/academic/economics/foley/gradschool.htm|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional or additional coursework will depend on the program's emphasis. In theory-focused degrees, and those preparing students for doctoral work, this coursework is often in these same core topics, but in greater depth. In terminal or applied or [[Professional degree|career-focused degrees]], options may include [[public finance]], [[labour economics|labour-]], [[financial economics|financial-]], [[development economics|development-]], [[industrial economics|industrial-]],  [[health economics|health-]] or [[agricultural economics]]. These degrees may also allow for a specialization in one of these areas, and may be named correspondingly (for example [[Master's in Financial Economics]], [[Masters in International Economics]], [[Masters in Development Economics]], Master's in Sustainable Economic Development and [[Masters in Agricultural Economics]].)

Entry requirements are undergraduate work in (calculus-based) economics, at least at the intermediate level, and often as a [[academic major|major]], and a sufficient level of mathematical training (including courses in  [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; often ([[Multivariable calculus|multivariable]]) [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]]; and sometimes [[mathematical analysis]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11538">'''Nilotic landscape''' is any artistic representation of landscapes that emulates or is inspired by the [[Nile]] river in [[Egypt]]. The term was coined to refer primarily to such landscapes created outside of Egypt, especially in the Aegean, though it is occasionally used to refer to scenes of hunting and fishing in Egyptian art. A nilotic landscape is a river scene with rich and abundant plant and animal life, much of which is native to Egypt. Common iconographic elements include papyrus, palm trees, fish and water birds, and in some cases felines, monkeys, and/or crocodile.

Archaeological evidence attests to painted depictions of the Nile in Egyptian tombs as early as the [[Predynastic]] period. Nilotic scenes remain popular throughout the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and flourish in the [[New Kingdom]]. Of particular prominence are landscapes in tombs paintings of the [[18th dynasty]] of Egypt. Nilotic landscapes are first adapted outside of Egypt in the Aegean, notably in the art of the [[Minoan civilization]]. The subject enjoys a renaissance in Hellenistic and [[Roman art]], when nilotic scenes become a common subject for [[mosaic]]s, most famously the 1st-century BC [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]].  These emphasized the exoticism of the Nile, as well as its busyness as a waterway.  Scenes of water traffic are depicted next to abundant and often dangerous wildlife. 

A number of biblical subjects in art, such as the [[Finding of Moses]], are set in Egypt, and Christian artists slowly evolved modest conventions for conveying the unfamiliar landscape. The process accelelerated after the Renaissance, with [[Nicolas Poussin]], who painted many subjects on the life of [[Moses]], a particular pioneer in developing a more authentic decor.  But the process was slow until the start of the 19th century, with increased Western travel, the advent of modern [[Egyptology]], and in art the development of [[Orientalism]].  By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jason, ''Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology 1: From Antiquity to 1881'', 255, 2015, The American University in Cairo Press, {{ISBN|9774165993}}, 9789774165993, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rd-yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 google books]; Tromans, Nicholas, and others, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'', 2008, [[Tate Gallery|Tate Publishing]], {{ISBN|9781854377333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The production of nilotic landscapes as well as their iconography and interpretations depend on the provenance of the work and the culture in which it was produced, but most scenes on the whole affirm and celebrate the abundance of nature.

==Iconography ==

The most important feature of a nilotic landscape is its riverine setting, which is the ultimate source of any accompanying plant and animal life. The annual flooding of the Nile river in Egypt was not only the source of the ancient civilization’s food and crops, but also provided them with a dependable cyclical calendar. Much of Egypt’s continuity in antiquity, both in society and in art, is thought to stem from the people’s relationship to the Nile.

Nilotic landscapes are filled with abundant plant and animal life. Blue and green pigments often dominate the scene. The [[papyrus]] plant and palm trees are the most recognizable botanic features of a nilotic landscape, along with other plants, often carefully depicted and identifiable. Various animals are represented and vary depending on the specific scene. Many varieties of fish and water birds are found in the scenes, and hunting and fishing scenes usually include cats.  Other nilotic landscapes, especially those outside of Egypt, include exotic, foreign animals, such as monkeys and crocodiles, and often fantastic creatures or monsters like griffins and sphinxes.

==Nilotic landscapes in Egypt==

The phrase "nilotic landscape" is used in Egyptian studies to describe the scenes in tomb paintings where the deceased is engaged in hunting and fishing. These scenes stress the elite character and importance of the deceased, who conquers nature and dominates the landscape, participating in activities reserved for the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Tiradritti, Francesco. (2007). ''Egyptian Wall Painting''. New York: Abbeville Publishing Group (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7892-1005-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Many scenes are symmetrical, with the image of the deceased repeated, first engaged in the act of hunting birds and then spearing fish. The birds and fish often appear in large numbers. They are easily captured by the deceased as they appear to literally fly around him or swim right up to his spear. Thus man is shown in a position of control over nature and the natural world as subservient to his own existence. 

Though these scenes have a centuries-old tradition, they become increasingly popular in the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom, with prominent examples of these scenes discovered in tombs from the necropolis of ancient Thebes in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: ''Hunting in the marsh'',
a fragment of painted plaster from the tomb of Nebamun, ''Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
painted plaster from the tomb of Nakht, and'' Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
Painted plaster from the tomb of Menna)&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically the scenes are characterized by a sense of movement and liveliness not normally seen in most Egyptian works, which for centuries portrayed static, stoic figures and creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. and Christin J. Mamiya. (2004). ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'', Vol. 1. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-534-64095-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample attention paid to detail discernible in the realistic rendering of individual plant and animal species. Variety is imparted by means of these careful details and individualized characterizations.

==Nilotic Landscapes in the Aegean ==

River scenes suggesting the natural world and its lush vegetation begin to appear outside of Egypt contemporaneously with the 18th dynasty, the first extant evidence coming from [[fresco]] fragments of the Minoans. The Aegean version of the nilotic landscape retains many key iconographic elements of the Egyptian version, but the Minoans often make the landscape itself the subject, emphasizing plants and wildlife over human figures (which are generally left out of the work). The compositions are characteristic of the Minoan artistic style, more irregular and informal. Attention is paid to detail and color with respect to plants and animals, but precisely drawn patterns seldom arise and the background and setting may be highly imaginative. They are true frescoes, painted on wet plaster so that the color chemically adheres to the surface, unlike the Egyptian versions.

Nilotic landscapes in Minoan art are evidence of contact between the Minoans and the Egyptians, both through trade and the exchange of ideas. Plants like papyrus and animals like monkeys were not native to [[Crete]]. Many of the plant and animal species are identifiable, confirming not only that the artists paid close attention to detail, but also that they must have been familiar with these species, either through examination of Egyptian painting or, as seems more likely, by means of direct contact with these creatures, plants, and Egyptian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. Vivian and Louise Schofield. (1995). ''Egypt, the Aegean, and the Levant: Interconnections in the Second Millennium BC''. London: British Museum Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7141-0987-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the “House of the Frescoes”, located near the Minoan palace at [[Knossos]], fresco fragments were unearthed depicting blue monkeys and blue birds in a rocky landscape with a winding blue river, along with various types of plants, including papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Arthur. (1936). ''The Palace of Minos at Knossos'', I-IV. London: Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This scene has been dubbed a “nilotic landscape” by archaeologists and art historians due to its inclusion of blue monkeys and papyrus in a riverine setting.

[[File:Akrotiri river.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Detail of Nilotic landscape from Thera, riverine scene with panther chasing ducks]]

Excavations at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] have preserved a number of frescoes dating to the Late Bronze Age. One such scene from the "West House" on the east wall of Room 5 has been termed a nilotic landscape. It features a mix of real and imaginary creatures. A griffin flies over the meandering river, a wild cat stalks ducks, and palm trees pervade. Unlike the two other fresco scenes in this room, the nilotic landscape is devoid of human figures and lacks narrative, focusing instead on the wildlife and environment and glorifying the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Cristos. (1983) ''Thera. Pompeii of the ancient Aegean. Excavations at Akrotiri, 1967-79''. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-500-39016-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of human figures in these Minoan nilotic landscapes has led many archaeologists to assume the presence of a nature goddess or divinity in Minoan religion.&lt;ref&gt;Marinatos, Nanno. (1993). ''Minoan Religion: Ritual, Image, and Symbol''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-87249-744-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy for Children''', sometimes abbreviated to '''P4C''', is a movement that aims to teach [[reasoning]] and argumentative skills to [[children]]. There are also related methods sometimes called "''Philosophy for Young People''" or "''Philosophy for Kids''". Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Splitter and Ann M. Sharp, Teaching for Better Thinking, ACER: Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a long tradition within [[higher education]] of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges (see ''"[[philosophy education]]"'').&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Philosophy 4 Skool, by Michael Brett, http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/philinschool.htm accessed July 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the noted [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] was of the impression that children were not capable of [[critical thinking]] until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is [[empirical evidence]] that teaching children [[reasoning]] skills early in life greatly improves other [[cognitive]] and [[academic]] skills and greatly assists learning in general.&lt;ref&gt;k.J. Topping and S. Trickey (2007) "Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry for School Children", British Journal of Educational Psychology, Dec 77(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "inquiry" is preferred to "lesson" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.

==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==

One of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called "the most influential figure" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt; at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue. Lipman's ideas about learning, pedagogy and curriculum are heavily influenced by the educational and philosophical ideas of the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;Bleazby, Jennifer (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools. Routledge: New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the materials used by the IAPC are philosophical children's novels that were published by Lipman, including ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'', which he published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/children/#2&lt;/ref&gt; Others have built on Lipman's ideas and developed further teaching resources and learning activities that compliment his original Philosophy for Children novels and pedagogical approach, such as Phil Cam's popular teaching resources &lt;ref&gt;Cam, Phil (2012) Teaching Ethics in Schools. ACER: Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cam, Phil (1993-97) Thinking Stories, Hale and Iremonger.&lt;/ref&gt; Lipman wrote the world's first systematic pre-college philosophy curriculum and created both masters and doctoral programs in the field of Philosophy for Children. He also founded ''Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/thinking-journal/ Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gareth Matthews]] worked with a variety of students, but primarily with students in late primary school (5th grade and thereabouts). Matthews' method was to get the students to actively create philosophical settings, to “make the philosophical problem their own”. One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book ''Dialogues With Children''.

Karin Murris of Witwatersrand University, South Africa and Joanna Haynes of Plymouth University, England, have popularised the use of children's picture books as an alternative to purpose-written materials. Tom Wartenberg of Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts has also written a large number of discussion plans for philosophising with picture books.

Jana Mohr Lone has written about children's philosophical thinking and the benefits of encouraging children to engage in philosophical inquiry.

Ellen Duthie, together with her team based in Spain, researches and develops the possibilities of [http://www.wonderponderonline.com Visual Philosophy for Children] (and adults), exploring different ways of engaging and stimulating philosophical dialogue through visuals in her Wonder Ponder series of books.    

There is particular diversity in the UK, owing to the large number of competing and collaborating freelance trainers each emphasising different strands of the pedagogy. Roger Sutcliffe's practice includes the use of news stories; Steve Williams has emphasised the importance of dialogues that model argument as well as raising philosophical issues; [[Will ord|Will Ord]] emphasises the use of striking photos, often containing contrasts that suggest opposing concepts.;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkingeducation.co.uk/p4c.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Buckley advocates a more physical, game-based approach and "Philosophy in Role", in which children philosophise within a story as characters confronted with a variety of problems.

[http://www.sapere.org.uk/ SAPERE] is the UK's leading provider of P4C training.  Registered in 1994, the charity has trained over 27,000 teachers and other individuals in the use of P4C.  SAPERE's mission is to advance the educational, personal and social development of young people, especially those facing disadvantage, through the promotion of P4C.  The organisation's work gained national prominence in 2015 when Durham University School of Education published results of a randomised control trial of P4C with over 3,000 primary school students.  The study was sponsored by the [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/ Education Endowment Foundation]. The [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evaluation/projects/philosophy-for-children/ study] found that P4C advanced attainment for all students and had a particularly strong impact on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Co-founded by [[Peter Worley]] and Emma Worley, The [http://www.philosophy-foundation.org/ Philosophy Foundation]'s specialist philosophy teachers (all philosophy graduates) specifically use philosophical material, including thought-experiments and stories or activities that lead to questions from the philosophical canon. They make use of carefully structured questioning strategies and also the introduction of thinking skills in order to develop good thinking habits from a young age. The questioning strategies are used to introduce dialectic along Platonic lines and in order to maintain philosophical focus. Uniquely they have a methodology that introduces writing and meta-analysis with older primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;For more on The [[Philosophy Foundation]]'s methodology see 'The If Machine: Philosophical Enquiry in the Classroom' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120504005234/http://www.philosophy-foundation.org/shop/overview] by Peter Worley.&lt;/ref&gt;

UK based Thinking Space is Grace Robinson, a philosopher and a network of associated philosophers and educators whose work is characterised by playful and experimental collaborations. This work with a range of practitioners, among them artists, scientists, and academics, aims to bring philosophical issues alive for children and young people. Thinking Space's most notable collaboration is with The University of Leeds on 'Leeds Philosophy Exchange'; an accredited undergraduate course in which philosophy students facilitate philosophical enquiry in local primary schools, alongside teachers trained by Thinking Space in P4C.

A particular way of doing philosophy with children is illustrated by the work of [[Christopher R. Phillips|Chris Phillips]] with the Philosophers Club at Cesar Chavez Elementary School in the [[Mission District, San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Socrates' Children: A volunteer teaches kids philosophy -- and how to listen to one another |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/01/22/MN18636.DTL |date=1999-01-22 |last=Moore |first=Teresa |publisher=SFGate |access-date=2006-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112205525/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1999%2F01%2F22%2FMN18636.DTL |archive-date=2007-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor William Barry]] of [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] is pioneering a new approach to p4c called Philosophy for Children and Community (P4c²) in the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area. His contribution to evolving the idea of p4c involves young people becoming novice critical theory action researchers and meaningful members of communities of inquiry focused on human flourishing for every person. Another key component of Barry's P4c² is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory. The Institute of P4c² has recently been developed by Living Leadership Today, LLC Founder Maria Rachelle in Silicon Valley California and resulted in the creation of the online international scholarly journal, the ''International Journal of Transformative Research [http://IJTR.net].

==Programs, competitions, and publications==
There are a number of college-level academic philosophy programs in the United States that do outreach to public schools, most notably at the [http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/ University of Washington], University of Massachusetts - Boston, [[University of Chicago]],  [[California State University Long Beach]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Montclair State University]], [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Hawai`i at Manoa]], [[Notre Dame de Namur University]], [[Creighton University]], and [[Plattsburgh State University Of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plattsburgh.edu/academics/philosophy/faculty/dixon.php Plattsburgh State University Of New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Washington, the Center for Philosophy for Children educates University of Washington graduate and undergraduate students about how to facilitate philosophy sessions, and then sends them into Seattle classrooms with supervision and mentoring from experienced instructors. This program has introduced philosophy to thousands of public school students, and runs many year-long weekly philosophy sessions in Seattle public school classrooms. The Center has four graduate fellowships in pre-college philosophy and also runs regular workshops and programs for teachers, parents and other adults about how to introduce philosophy to young people.

At the University of Chicago, students in the college teach in schools on Chicago South Side through the University's [[Civic Knowledge Project]]. The class, known as [[Winning Words]], is an after school program that works with elementary, middle and high school students in Chicago. The program aims to engage and inspire local youth through an education in philosophy, reasoning and the verbal arts of dialogue and rhetoric; building self-confidence and exposing its students to a wide range of philosophical material. Recognized by the [[American Philosophical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100324132609/http://plato-apa.org/organizations/centers-institutes/ American Philosophical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; the program provides an introduction to philosophy and Socratic dialogue and includes writing, public speaking, debate, drama, poetry and art. The material uses the Socratic method to engage students and to encourage the use of critical thinking, reasoning and expression. Such modes of thought and communication foster the sense of wonder that is at the root of serious introspection, intellectual growth, and ethical reflection. February 2012, the American Philosophical Association's Committee on Pre-Collegiate Philosophy featured Winning Words and the Civic Knowledge Project in its Central Division meeting.

Before the Department of Education cut funding for such programs in the early 1990s, there were over 5,000 programs in K-12 schools nationwide which engaged young people in philosophical reflection or critical thinking, more generally. This number has dropped substantially.

The [[Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]] (IAPC), which has been recognized by the APA for excellence and innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115150957/http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/index.shtml |archivedate=2011-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes [[Lipman]]'s method, exposing children to philosophically stimulating narrative to encourage them to create and ask their own philosophical questions, actively in the [[K-12]] classroom through a longstanding partnership with the [[Montclair public school system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montclair.k12.nj.us/WebPage.aspx?Id=1 Montclair public school system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209050236/http://www.montclair.k12.nj.us/WebPage.aspx?Id=1 |date=2011-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students are encouraged to ask their questions and the philosophical facilitator (a member of the IAPC) helps the children to develop philosophical skills and dispositions of critical, caring, and creative thinking in order to get the young students to come to reasonable judgment about what is "best to do or believe," in response to the initial question. IAPC has a large teacher preparation component and provides teacher manuals that include discussion plans specifically designed to assist in the facilitation of philosophical discussions that are general enough to answer most student questions. In addition to working directly with schoolchildren, members of the IAPC work with several constituencies, including professional and pre-professional educators, educational administrators and policy-makers, and faculty and students of education, philosophy and related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/about.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116102600/http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/about.shtml |archivedate=2011-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IAPC has trained educators worldwide to successfully implement their curriculum in their home states and countries.
Philosophy and Children organization offers introductory [[workshop]]s and Certificate courses in schools and graduate teachers in [[Australia]].

The [[Philosophy Learning and Teaching Organization]] (PLATO) is a national organization in the USA that provides support and resources for bringing philosophy into pre-college classrooms.

There is an annual ''[[Philosophy Slam]]'' competition for kids in grades K-12. Younger children are encouraged to submit artwork which illustrates their philosophical reflections while older children submit increasingly sophisticated written work.

In the UK the University of Leeds now offers a students into schools programme called Leeds Philosophy Exchange, led by Grace Robinson. The University of Bristol is now working on Bristol Philosophy Exchange applying a similar model in which philosophy students and primary school teachers exchange skills and knowledge in weekly philosophical enquiry with children.

Educational charity The Philosophy Foundation (formerly The Philosophy Shop) trains philosophy graduates to do philosophy with primary and secondary school children, and places them in schools nationwide. They also train teachers in the transferable skills of philosophy (questioning, thinking skills and discourse skills), and are encouraging an enquiry based approach to education at all levels, including tertiary.

[[SAPERE]] is a UK charity that trains teachers in P4C nationwide.

[[Thinking Space]] works with schools to devise creative philosophy projects that combine the expertise of philosophers and teachers.

The growth of a community between European philosophy with children ([[PWC]]) practitioners culminated in the establishment of  “Stichting [[SOPHIA (European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children)|SOPHIA]] —The European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children” in 1993, with Eulalia Bosch (Catalonia) as its President, and Karel van der Leeuw (the Netherlands) Secretary.  Following the motto of the European Community (now the [[European Union|EU]]) – ‘ unity through diversity’, [[SOPHIA (European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children)|SOPHIA]] supported the development of doing philosophy with children within all the different European cultures and languages, and nurtured the community among practitioners as the foundation for collaborative work and mutual development. Many groundbreaking and innovative projects have resulted from SOPHIA members working together, often funded by the EU. For example, pwc projects working with [[art]], [[citizenship]], [[excluded]] children, [[architecture]], [[anti-racism]], [[music]], [[community development]] and more.

In Australasia an extensive P4C network has developed since the 1980s.  Associations have been established in each Australian state and also the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA) has been instrumental in promoting P4C throughout Australasia. FAPSA is a professional non-profit organization promoting philosophy in schools and representing the interests of its affiliated associations across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The Federation’s primary purpose is to facilitate the educational aims and objectives of its affiliated associations. FAPSA has an official journal called the ''[[Journal for Philosophy in Schools]]''

In 2007 a competition was created in Perth Western Australia called a [[Philosothon]]. This competition promotes P4C and has been phenomenally successful over its short history. Each Australian state now holds an annual Philosothon and FAPSA hosts the Australasian Philosothon in different states each year. There are over 400 schools involved in Philosothons in Australasia, Europe and the UK.

'''Psychogenic disease''' (or '''psychogenic illness''') is a name given to physical illnesses that are believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=E. C H|last2=Seet|first2=R. C S|title=What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=1 February 2007|volume=100|issue=2|pages=60–61|doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.2.60|pmid=17277261|pmc=1790983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly applied to illnesses where a physical abnormality or other biomarker has not yet been identified. In the absence of such "biological" evidence of an underlying disease process, it is often assumed that the illness must have a psychological cause, even if the patient shows no indications of being under stress or of having a psychological or psychiatric disorder.

Examples of diseases that are believed by many to be psychogenic include [[psychogenic seizures]], [[psychogenic polydipsia]], [[psychogenic tremor]] and [[psychogenic pain]].

There are problems with the assumption that all medically unexplained illness must have a psychological cause. It always remains possible that genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological or other abnormalities may be present which we do not have the technology or background to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|287464|Conversion Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Richard|title=Medically Unexplained Symptoms and the Siren "Psychogenic Inference"|journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology|date=2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=289–299|doi=10.1353/ppp.2010.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term psychogenic disease is often used in a similar way to [[psychosomatic]] disease. However, the term "psychogenic" usually implies that psychological factors played a key causal role in the development of the illness. The term "psychosomatic" is often used in a broader way to describe illnesses with a known medical cause where psychological factors may nonetheless play a role (e.g., asthma can be exacerbated by anxiety).

'''Radiation therapy''' or '''radiotherapy''', often abbreviated '''RT''', '''RTx''', or '''XRT''', is [[therapy]] using [[ionizing radiation]], generally as part of [[oncology|cancer treatment]] to control or kill [[Malignancy|malignant]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and normally delivered by a [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]]. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of [[adjuvant therapy]], to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with [[chemotherapy]], and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called '''radiation oncology'''.

Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous tissue leading to [[mitotic catastrophe|cellular death]].  To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger [[absorbed dose]] there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from [[radiology]], the use of radiation in [[medical imaging]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Radiation may be prescribed by a [[radiation oncologist]] with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as [[Palliative care|palliative treatment]] (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with [[surgery]], chemotherapy, [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone therapy]], [[immunotherapy]] or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.

The precise treatment intent (curative&lt;!--let's not use the term radical till we define it (below)--&gt;, adjuvant, [[Neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant therapeutic]], or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. [[Total body irradiation]] (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a [[bone marrow transplant]]. [[Brachytherapy]], in which a [[radioactive source]] is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]], [[Vestibular schwannoma|acoustic neuromas]], severe [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|thyroid eye disease]], [[pterygium]], [[pigmented villonodular synovitis]], and prevention of [[keloid]] scar growth, vascular [[restenosis]], and [[heterotopic ossification]]. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.

[[File:Palliative Care Options for a Young Adult Patient with a Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma - Fig. 3.png|thumb|Radiation therapy for a patient with a [[diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma]], with radiation dose color-coded.]]
Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller’s Textbook of Radiation therapy (6th Ed), p311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiosensitivity" on GP notebook http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=2060451853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Radiation therapy- what GPs need to know" on patient.co.uk http://patient.info/doctor/radiotherapy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: these refs support the whole list here --&gt;

The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.
Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include [[leukemias]], most [[lymphomas]] and [[germ cell tumors]].
The majority of [[epithelial cancers]] are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60-70&amp;nbsp;Gy) to achieve a radical cure.
Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. [[Renal cell cancer]] and [[melanoma]] are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with [[immunotherapy]] is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maverakis E, Cornelius LA, Bowen GM, Phan T, Patel FB, Fitzmaurice S, He Y, Burrall B, Duong C, Kloxin AM, Sultani H, Wilken R, Martinez SR, Patel F | title = Metastatic melanoma - a review of current and future treatment options | journal = Acta Derm Venereol | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–524 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25520039 | doi = 10.2340/00015555-2035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation "curability" of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example: [[Skin neoplasm|non-melanoma skin cancer]], [[head and neck cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[non-small cell lung cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], [[anal cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. [[Metastatic]] cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.

Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields.&lt;ref name=camphausen&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be set-up in the identical position during treatment.  Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient.

The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex [[radiobiology]], very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with [[wide local excision]] or [[mastectomy]] followed by [[adjuvant radiation therapy]]. Another method is to shrink the tumor with [[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include: [[Cisplatin]], [[Nimorazole]], and [[Cetuximab]].

The effect of radiotherapy on control of cancer has been shown to be limited to the first five years after surgery, particularly for breast cancer. The difference between breast cancer recurrence in patients who receive radiotherapy vs. those who don't is seen mostly in the first 2–3 years and no difference is seen after 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickberg A, Holmberg L, Adami HO, Magnuson A, Villman K, Liljegren G | title = Sector resection with or without postoperative radiotherapy for stage I breast cancer: 20-year results of a randomized trial | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 791–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24493730 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2013.50.6600 | lay-summary = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~rmhkjsv/TARGIT-A-follow-up.pdf | lay-source = Jayant S Vaidya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Radiation therapy is in itself painless. Many low-dose [[Palliative care|palliative treatments]] (for example, radiation therapy to bony [[metastases]]) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.

Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient's body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose- dependent; for example higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with [[cardiovascular]] complications, [[thyroid]] dysfunction, and [[pituitary]] axis dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mahmood SS |title=Cardiovascular Complications of Cranial and Neck Radiation |journal=Current Treatment Options in Cardiovascular Medicine|volume=18 |issue=45 | year= 2016|pmid=27181400 |doi=10.1007/s11936-016-0468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.

The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but  may not be as elastic as it was before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |title=Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer: Possible Side Effects |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041308/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/breast/possiblesideeffects.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute side effects===
; Nausea and vomiting
:This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the [[vestibule of the ear|vestibules of the inner ears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee VH, Ng SC, Leung TW, Au GK, Kwong DL | title = Dosimetric predictors of radiation-induced acute nausea and vomiting in IMRT for nasopharyngeal cancer | journal = International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–82 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22245210 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330060027/http://www.caring4cancer.com/go/cancer/effects/side-effects-of-radiation-therapy.htm |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }} Common radiation side effects&lt;/ref&gt;
; Damage to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping/radiation-therapy-and-you/page8 |title=Radiation Therapy Side Effects and Ways to Manage them|publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this [[moist desquamation]] is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.
; Mouth, throat and stomach sores
:If the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat.&lt;ref name="radiobiology_for_the_radiologist_5"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Eric J. | title = Radiobiology for the radiologist | year = 2000 | publisher = Lippincott Williams Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 9780781726498 | page =351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer.  When treating liver malignancies and metastases, it is possible for collateral radiation to cause gastric, stomach or duodenal ulcers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carretero C, Munoz-Navas M, Betes M, Angos R, Subtil JC, Fernandez-Urien I, De la Riva S, Sola J, Bilbao JI, de Luis E, Sangro B | title = Gastroduodenal injury after radioembolization of hepatic tumors | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 1216–20 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17355414 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01172.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yip D, Allen R, Ashton C, Jain S | title = Radiation-induced ulceration of the stomach secondary to hepatic embolization with radioactive yttrium microspheres in the treatment of metastatic colon cancer | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14748889 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2003.03322.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This collateral radiation is commonly caused by non-targeted delivery (reflux) of the radioactive agents being infused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy R, Brown DB, Salem R, Meranze SG, Coldwell DM, Krishnan S, Nunez R, Habbu A, Liu D, Ross W, Cohen AM, Censullo M | title = Gastrointestinal complications associated with hepatic arterial Yttrium-90 microsphere therapy | journal = Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 553–61; quiz 562 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17446547 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2007.02.002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods, techniques and devices are available to lower the occurrence of this type of adverse side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arepally A, Chomas J, Kraitchman D, Hong K | title = Quantification and reduction of reflux during embolotherapy using an antireflux catheter and tantalum microspheres: Ex vivo analysis | journal = Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 575–80 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23462064 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2012.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Intestinal discomfort
:The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.
; Swelling
:As part of the general [[inflammation]] that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised [[intracranial pressure]] or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (e.g., [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] or main [[bronchus]]). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive [[steroids]] during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.
; Infertility
:The [[gonads]] (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce [[gametes]] following '''direct''' exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.

===Late side effects===
Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.

; [[Fibrosis]]
: Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.
; Epilation
: Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1&amp;nbsp;Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field/s. Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10&amp;nbsp;Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45&amp;nbsp;Gy.
; Dryness
: The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]] in 2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]) and dry eyes ([[xerophthalmia]]) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]]. Similarly, [[sweat gland]]s in treated skin (such as the [[armpit]]) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal [[mucosa]] is often dry following pelvic irradiation.
; [[Lymphedema]]
: Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .&lt;ref name="pmid9874399"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meek AG | title = Breast radiation therapy and lymphedema | journal = Cancer | volume = 83 | issue = 12 Suppl American | pages = 2788–97 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9874399 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981215)83:12B+&lt;2788::AID-CNCR27&gt;3.0.CO;2-I }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Cancer
: Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in a very small minority of patients – usually less than 1/1000. It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer. The cancer occurs within the treated area of the patient.
; [[Cardiovascular disease]]
: Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor CW, Nisbet A, McGale P, Darby SC | title = Cardiac exposures in breast cancer radiotherapy: 1950s-1990s | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 1484–95 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18035211 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.05.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) by 1.5 to 4 times a person's normal rate, aggravating factors included.&lt;ref name="pmid:20298931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weintraub NL, Jones WK, Manka D | title = Understanding radiation-induced vascular disease | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1237–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20298931 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.053 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase is dose dependent, related to the RT's dose strength, volume and location.

Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular [[Endothelial dysfunction|cell damage]] and [[oxidative stress]] can lead to these and other late side effect symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid:28911261" /&gt; Most radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases occur 10 or more years post treatment, making causality determinations more difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid:20298931" /&gt;
; Cognitive decline
: In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause [[Radiation induced cognitive decline|cognitive decline]]. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5 year old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional/page4|title=Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Depending upon the irradiated zone, late effect neuropathy may occur in either the [[Central nervous system|central nervous system (CNS)]] or the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system (PNS)]]. In the CNS for example, cranial nerve injury typically presents as a visual acuity loss 1-14 years post treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid:23245644" /&gt; In the PNS, injury to the plexus nerves presents as radiation-induced brachial plexopathy or [[Radiation-induced lumbar plexopathy|radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy]] appearing up to 3 decades post treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid:23245644" /&gt;

===Cumulative side effects===
Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieder C, Milas L, Ang KK | title = Tissue tolerance to reirradiation | journal = Semin Radiat Oncol | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11034631 | doi = 10.1053/srao.2000.6593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.

===Effects on reproduction===
During the first two weeks after [[fertilization]], radiation therapy is lethal but not [[teratogenic]].&lt;ref name="arnon2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnon J, Meirow D, Lewis-Roness H, Ornoy A|year=2001|title=Genetic and teratogenic effects of cancer treatments on gametes and embryos|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=7|issue=4|pages=394–403|doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.394|pmid=11476352}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce [[congenital anomaly|anomalies]], [[Intrauterine growth restriction|impaired growth]] and [[intellectual disability]], and there may be an increased risk of [[childhood leukemia]] and other tumours in the offspring.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt; However, the use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.&lt;ref name=arnon2011/&gt;

===Effects on pituitary system===
[[Hypopituitarism]] commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies.&lt;ref name=Fernandez_2009/&gt; Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects [[growth hormone]] and [[gonadal hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="Fernandez_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernandez A, Brada M, Zabuliene L, Karavitaki N, Wass JA | title = Radiation-induced hypopituitarism | journal = Endocr.

===Radiation therapy accidents===
There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine [[Therac-25]] was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in [[Missouri]] overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25radiation.html|title=Missouri Hospital Reports Errors in Radiation Doses|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 February 2010|access-date=26 February 2010 | first1=Walt | last1=Bogdanich | first2=Rebecca R. | last2=Ruiz | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called  [https://www.astro.org/Patient-Care-and-Research/Patient-Safety/Target-Safely Target Safely] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |title=What Questions Should I Ask My Doctor?: Questions to ask after treatment ends |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-09-22 |access-date=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412020804/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/questions/safetyquestions.aspx |archive-date=2012-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in non-cancerous diseases==
[[File:DupuytrensRadiotherapyHamburg.jpg|thumb|The beam's eye view of the radiotherapy portal on the hand's surface with the lead shield cut-out placed in the machine's gantry]]

Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage [[Dupuytren's contracture|Dupuytren's disease]] and [[Plantar fibromatosis|Ledderhose disease]]. When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Charles|last2=Seegenschmiedt|first2=M.

==Technique==

===Mechanism of action===
Radiation therapy works by damaging the [[DNA]] of cancerous cells. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, [[photon]] or [[charged particle]]. This damage is either direct or indirect [[ionization]] of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect [[ionization]] happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], notably [[hydroxyl]] radicals, which then damage the DNA.

In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and [[double-stranded DNA]] damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo [[Apoptosis|cell death]]. Cancer cells are generally less [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] and more [[stem cell]]-like; they reproduce more than most healthy [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.

One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in [[oxygen]]. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Oxygen is a potent [[radiosensitizer]], increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison LB, Chadha M, Hill RJ, Hu K, Shasha D | title = Impact of tumor hypoxia and anemia on radiation therapy outcomes | journal = Oncologist | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 492–508 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12490737 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-6-492 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12490737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, [[hyperthermia therapy]] (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as [[misonidazole]] and [[metronidazole]], and hypoxic [[cytotoxins]] (tissue poisons), such as [[tirapazamine]].  Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an [[oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound]] such as [[trans sodium crocetinate]] (TSC) as a  [[radiosensitizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheehan JP, Shaffrey ME, Gupta B, Larner J, Rich JN, Park DM | title = Improving the radiosensitivity of radioresistant and hypoxic glioblastoma | journal = Future Oncology | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 1591–1601 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21062158 | doi = 10.2217/fon.10.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charged particles such as [[proton]]s and [[boron]], [[carbon]], and [[neon]] ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET ([[linear energy transfer]]) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the [[Bragg peak]] effect. See [[proton therapy]] for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. [[charged particle therapy]]. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker DG, Edwards BK, Tucker MA, Fraumeni JF Jr. (eds). New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973–2000. National Cancer Institute. NIH Publ. No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: [[head and neck cancers]]).
This x-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and they have a 30% chance of a second malignancy after 5 years post initial RT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/ISS/PDF/Risikoanalyse/Georgetown/Robison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dose===
The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;Gy.

Preventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45–60&amp;nbsp;Gy in 1.8–2&amp;nbsp;Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by [[radiation oncologist]]s when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.

Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during [[treatment planning]] (part of [[dosimetry]]). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the [[dosimetry]] technique known as [[gel dosimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldock C, De Deene Y, Doran S, Ibbott G, Jirasek A, Lepage M, McAuley KB, Oldham M, Schreiner LJ | year = 2010 | title = Polymer gel dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 5| page = R1 | doi=10.1088/0031-9155/55/5/r01 | pmid=20150687 | pmc=3031873| bibcode=2010PMB....55R...1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Fractionation
{{hatnote|This section only applies to photon radiotherapy although other types of radiation therapy may be fractionated}}
The total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ang|first1=K. Kian|title=Altered fractionation trials in head and neck cancer|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|date=October 1998|volume=8|issue=4|pages=230–236|doi=10.1016/S1053-4296(98)80020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.

In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.

Patients receiving [[palliative radiation]] to treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive more than a single fraction of radiation.&lt;ref name="AAHPMfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |author1-link =  American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]] |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-hospice-palliative-medicine/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}, which cites

;Schedules for fractionation
One fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction to 20&amp;nbsp;Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, or SABR – also known as SBRT, or stereotactic body radiotherapy) for subcranial lesions, or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation – ''i.e.'' the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly (apoptosis), as in routine radiotherapy.

==== Estimation of dose based on target sensitivity ====
Different cancer types have different radiation sensitivity. However, predicting the sensitivity based on genomic or proteomic analyses of biopsy samples has proved difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott JG, Berglund A, Schell MJ, Mihaylov I, Fulp WJ, Yue B, Welsh E, Caudell JJ, Ahmed K, Strom TS, Mellon E, Venkat P, Johnstone P, Foekens J, Lee J, Moros E, Dalton WS, Eschrich SA, McLeod H, Harrison LB, Torres-Roca JF | title = A genome-based model for adjusting radiotherapy dose (GARD): a retrospective, cohort-based study | journal = The Lancet.

==Types==
Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are :
*[[external beam radiation therapy]] (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy; 
*brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy; and 
*systemic radioisotope therapy or [[unsealed source radiotherapy]]. 
The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.

[[Particle therapy]] is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are [[proton]]s or heavier [[ions]].

===External beam radiation therapy===

{{Main|External beam radiation therapy}}

The following three sections refer to treatment using x-rays.

====Conventional external beam radiation therapy====

}}]]
Conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill R, Healy B, Holloway L, Kuncic Z, Thwaites D, Baldock C | title = Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = R183-231 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24584183 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/R183 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.183H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. ''Conventional'' refers to the way the treatment is ''planned'' or ''simulated'' on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired ''plan''. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lagendijk JJ, Raaymakers BW, Van den Berg CA, Moerland MA, Philippens ME, van Vulpen M | title = MR guidance in radiotherapy | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 21 | pages = R349-69 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25322150 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/21/R349 | bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.349L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stereotactic radiation====

{{main|Radiosurgery}}

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.

There are two types of stereotactic radiation. '''Stereotactic radiosurgery''' (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. '''Stereotactic body radiation therapy''' (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |title=American Society for Radiation Oncology |publisher=Astro.org |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613154749/http://astro.org/PressRoom/PressKit/AnnualMeeting/documents/Timmerman.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.

Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, [[Cyberknife]], [[Gamma Knife]], Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, [[X-Knife]], [[TomoTherapy]], Trilogy and [[Truebeam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |title=Treatment Types: Stereotactic Radiation Therapy |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091107/http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/treatmenttypes/stereotacticradiation.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.

====Virtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy====

The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucci MK, Bevan A, Roach M | title = Advances in radiation therapy: conventional to 3D, to IMRT, to 4D, and beyond | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–34 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15761080 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.55.2.117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.

An enhancement of virtual simulation is '''3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT)''', in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a [[beam's eye view]] (BEV) using a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) and a variable number of beams. &lt;!--I took this out -- see discussion: The aim of this process is to improve the [[therapeutic index]] of the radiation therapy: by conforming the treatment volume--&gt;When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.&lt;ref name=camphausen/&gt;

==== Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) ====
[[File:Varian TruBeam.jpg|thumb|[[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] TruBeam [[Linear Accelerator]], used for delivering IMRT]]
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.&lt;ref name="Galvin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galvin JM, Ezzell G, Eisbrauch A, Yu C, Butler B, Xiao Y, Rosen I, Rosenman J, Sharpe M, Xing L, Xia P, Lomax T, Low DA, Palta J | title = Implementing IMRT in clinical practice: a joint document of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine | journal = Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 1616–34 | date = Apr 2004 | pmid = 15050343 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes,&lt;ref name="camphausen" /&gt; for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irsa.org/imrt.html |title=Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy |publisher=Irsa.org |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and treatment simulation ([[Treatment Planning]]). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.

3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.

Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor [[Christopher Nutting]] of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT,&lt;ref name="pmid12694826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall EJ, Wuu CS | title = Radiation-induced second cancers: the impact of 3D-CRT and IMRT | journal = Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12694826 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-3016(03)00073-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.

Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wing-Fai Loke |author2=Tae-Young Choi |author3=Teimour Maleki |author4=Lech Papiez |author5=Babak Ziaie |author6=Byunghoo Jung |title=Magnetic Tracking System for Radiation Therapy  |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems |year=2010 |doi= 10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2046737 |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |pages= 223–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=M.

==== Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) ====
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2007&lt;ref name="pmid22011829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teoh M, Clark CH, Wood K, Whitaker S, Nisbet A | title = Volumetric modulated arc therapy: a review of current literature and clinical use in practice | journal = The British Journal of Radiology | volume = 84 | issue = 1007 | pages = 967-96 | date = Nov 2011 | pmid = 22011829 | doi = 10.1259/bjr/22373346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields with one or more arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a [[multileaf collimator]] (MLC) ("sliding window" system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), of reduced radiation delivery times.&lt;ref name="pmid20188427"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertelsen A, Hansen CR, Johansen J, Brink C | title = Single Arc Volumetric modulated Arc therapy of head and neck cancer | journal = Radiotherapy and Oncology : Journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–8 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20188427 | doi = 10.1016/j.radonc.2010.01.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSN:1748-717X-8-37"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = VanGestel D, VanVliet-Vroegindeweij C, VanDenHeuvel F, Crijns W, Coelmont A, DeOst B, Holt A, Lamers E, Geussens Y, Nuyts S, VanDenWeyngaert D, VanDenWyngaert T, Vermorken JB, Gregoire V | title = RapidArc, SmartArc and TomoHD compared with classical step and shoot and sliding window intensity modulated radiotherapy in an oropharyngeal cancer treatment plan comparison | journal = Radiation Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 37 | date = Feb 2013 | doi = 10.1186/1748-717X-8-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) depends upon the cancer type.

====Particle therapy====

{{Main|Particle therapy}}

In particle therapy ([[proton therapy]] being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|title=Brain tumor patient 'unaware' treatment was available on NHS|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622115602/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brain-tumour-patient-unaware-treatment-was-available-on-nhs-1301570.html|archivedate=22 June 2009|first=Jeremy|last=Laurance|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the [[Bragg peak]]) that occurs near the end of the particle's [[Range (particle radiation)|range]], and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.

====Auger therapy====

{{Main|Auger therapy}}

[[Auger therapy]] (AT) makes use of a very high dose&lt;ref name="pmid1461197"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kereiakes JG, Rao DV | title = Auger electron dosimetry: report of AAPM Nuclear Medicine Committee Task Group No. 6 | journal = Med Phys | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1359 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1461197 | doi =  10.1118/1.596925| last2 = Rao | bibcode = 1992MedPh..19.1359K }}&lt;/ref&gt; of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.

===Contact x-ray brachytherapy===
Contact x-ray brachytherapy (also called "CXB", "electronic brachytherapy" or the "Papillon Technique") is a type of radiation therapy using kilovoltage [[X-ray]]s applied close to the tumour to treat [[rectal cancer]]. The process involves inserting the [[x-ray tube]] through the [[anus]] into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue, then high doses of X-rays are emitted directly into the [[tumor cells|tumor]] at two weekly intervals.  It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery.&lt;ref name=NICE&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg532|title=Contact X-ray Brachytherapy for early rectal cancer|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|first=|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIieBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109|title=Modern Management of Cancer of the Rectum|last1=Sun Myint|first1=Arthur|last2=Gerard|first2=Jean-Pierre|last3=Myerson|first3=Robert J.|date=2014|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9781447166092|editor1-last=Longo|editor1-first=Walter E. | name-list-format = vanc |location=|pages=109ff|language=en|chapter=Contact X-Ray Brachytherapy for Rectal Cancer|editor2-last=Reddy|editor2-first=Vikram|editor3-last=Audisio|editor3-first=Riccardo A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPM-report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_152.pdf | title = The 2007 AAPM response to the CRCPD request for recommendations for the CRCPD's model regulations for electronic brachytherapy | access-date = 17 April 2010 | author = American Association of Physicists in Medicine | authorlink =  |date= February 2009 |publisher = American Association of Physicists in Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.&lt;ref name=NICE/&gt;

===Brachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy)===
{{Main|Brachytherapy}}
[[File:1 applicator.jpg|thumb|A SAVI brachytherapy device]]

Brachytherapy is delivered by placing radiation source(s) inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical,&lt;ref name="GEC-ESTRO-Cervix"&gt;

In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.&lt;ref name="GEC-ESTRO-General" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007"&gt;
{{Cite book | last = Stewart AJ | editor = Devlin P | year = 2007 | title = Brachytherapy. Applications and Techniques | chapter = Radiobiological concepts for brachytherapy | publisher = LWW | location = Philadelphia | id =  | displayauthors =  etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2007" /&gt;

As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid19744892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yashar CM, Blair S, Wallace A, Scanderbeg D | title = Initial clinical experience with the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant brachytherapy applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–72 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19744892 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2009.03.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsealed source radiotherapy (systemic radioisotope therapy)===
{{Main|Unsealed source radiotherapy}}
Systemic radioisotope therapy (RIT) is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through [[Route of administration|infusion]] (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of [[metaiodobenzylguanidine]] (MIBG) to treat [[neuroblastoma]], of oral [[iodine-131]] to treat [[thyroid cancer]] or [[thyrotoxicosis]], and of hormone-bound [[lutetium-177]] and [[yttrium-90]] to treat [[neuroendocrine tumors]] ([[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]]).

Another example is the injection of yttrium-90 radioactive glass or resin microspheres into the [[Hepatic artery proper|hepatic artery]] to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases.  These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as [[selective internal radiation therapy]]. The microspheres are approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a [[catheter]] up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently two different kinds of microspheres: [[SIR-Spheres]] and [[TheraSphere]].

A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of [[bone metastasis]] from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are [[radium-223]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Christopher |title=Alpha Emiiter Radium-223 and Survival in Metastatic Prostate Cancer |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=July 18, 2013 |volume=369 |issue=3 |pages=213-23 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1213755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strontium-89]] and [[Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam|samarium (&lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Sm) lexidronam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sartor O | title = Overview of samarium sm 153 lexidronam in the treatment of painful metastatic bone disease | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 6 Suppl 10 | issue = Suppl 10 | pages = S3–S12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16985930 | pmc = 1472939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[ibritumomab tiuxetan]] (Zevalin), which is an anti-[[CD20]] [[monoclonal antibody]] conjugated to yttrium-90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html Fda Approves First Radiopharmaceutical Product To Treat Non-Hodgkin’S Lymphoma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119111338/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01138.html |date=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the FDA approved the [[tositumomab]]/iodine (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab – Product Approval Information – Licensing Action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513024727/http://www.fda.gov/cder/biologics/products/tosicor062703.htm |date=May 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These medications were the first agents of what is known as [[radioimmunotherapy]], and they were approved for the treatment of refractory [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]].

===Intraoperative radiotherapy===
{{main|Intraoperative radiation therapy}}
[[Intraoperative radiation therapy]] (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a [[cancerous|cancer]] tumor, while the area is exposed during [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutta SW, Showalter SL, Showalter TN, Libby B, Trifiletti DM | title = Intraoperative radiation therapy for breast cancer patients: current perspectives | journal = Breast Cancer | volume = 9 | pages = 257–263 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28458578 | pmc = 5402914 | doi = 10.2147/BCTT.S112516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale====
The rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.&lt;ref name="pmid18316551"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belletti B, Vaidya JS, D'Andrea S, Entschladen F, Roncadin M, Lovat F, Berton S, Perin T, Candiani E, Reccanello S, Veronesi A, Canzonieri V, Trovò MG, Zaenker KS, Colombatti A, Baldassarre G, Massarut S | title = Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy impairs the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 1325–32 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316551 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep inspiration breath-hold ===
[[Deep inspiration breath-hold]] (DIBH) is a method of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanley J, Debois MM, Mah D, Mageras GS, Raben A, Rosenzweig K, Mychalczak B, Schwartz LH, Gloeggler PJ, Lutz W, Ling CC, Leibel SA, Fuks Z, Kutcher GJ | title = Deep inspiration breath-hold technique for lung tumors: the potential value of target immobilization and reduced lung density in dose escalation | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–11 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10524412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deep Inspiration Breath-hold|url = http://www.genesiscare.co.uk/cancer-treatment/radiotherapy/dibh|publisher= Genesis Care|access-date = 14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:X-ray treatment of tuberculosis 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|X-ray treatment of [[tuberculosis]] in 1910.  Before the 1920s, the hazards of radiation were not understood, and it was used to treat a wide range of diseases. ]]
{{Main|History of radiation therapy}}

Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]].&lt;ref name="UAB"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 | title=University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center, History of Radiation Oncology|format=from the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043216/http://www3.ccc.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=68504 |archivedate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Emil Grubbe]] of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.&lt;ref name=pioneer&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pioneer in X-Ray Therapy | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |series=New Series | volume = 125 | date = 4 January 1957 | pages=18–19 | issue = 3236 | bibcode =   1957Sci...125T..18.| doi = 10.1126/science.125.3236.18 | jstor = 1752791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of [[Nobel Prize]]–winning scientist [[Marie Curie]] (1867–1934), who discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research.&lt;ref name="UAB"/&gt;  Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.

Prior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were [[radium]], its "emanation", [[radon]] gas, and the [[x-ray tube]].  [[External beam radiotherapy]] (teletherapy) began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage (&lt;150&amp;nbsp;kV) x-ray machines.  It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages.  [[Orthovoltage X-rays]], which used tube voltages of 200-500&amp;nbsp;kV, began to be used during the 1920s.  To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1&amp;nbsp;MV or above, called "megavolt" radiation.  Producing megavolt x-rays required [[voltage]]s on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million [[volt]]s, which required huge expensive installations.  Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions.    One of the first, installed at [[St. Bartholomew's hospital]], London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons.    Radium produced megavolt [[gamma ray]]s, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores.  In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.

The invention of the [[nuclear reactor]] in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War 2 made possible the production of artificial [[radioisotope]]s for radiotherapy.  [[Cobalt therapy]], [[teletherapy]] machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by [[cobalt-60]], a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s.  Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year [[half-life]] the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.

Medical [[linear particle accelerator]]s, developed since the 1940s, began replacing x-ray and cobalt units in the 1980s and these older therapies are now declining. The first medical linear accelerator was used at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thwaites DI, Tuohy JB | title = Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 51 | issue = 13 | pages = R343-62 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790912 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/51/13/R20 | bibcode = 2006PMB....51R.343T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear accelerators can produce higher energies, have more collimated beams, and do not produce radioactive waste with its attendant disposal problems like radioisotope therapies.

With [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]’s invention of [[computed tomography]] (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient's anatomy.   The advent of new imaging technologies, including [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in the 1970s and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to [[image-guided radiation therapy]] (IGRT) [[tomotherapy]]. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |title=History of Radiation Therapy: The Evolution of Therapeutic Radiology |publisher=Rtanswers.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301041554/http://www.rtanswers.com/aboutus/history.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While access to radiotherapy is improving globally, more than half of patients in low and [[Developing country|middle income countries]] still do not have available access to the therapy as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21728893-science-will-win-technical-battle-against-cancer-only-half-fight-closing|title=Closing in on cancer|date=16 September 2017|work=The Economist|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

'''Fir and spruce forests''' are greatly affected by slight fluctuations in climate. Temperature is the primary determinate for spatial patterns of fir and spruce.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Louis and Prasad. “Potential Changes in Tree Species Richness and Forest Community Types following Climate Change.” 2001. Ecosystems 4: 186-199. 20 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dominant trees in this type of forest are ''[[Picea engelmannii]]'' (Engelmann spruce) and ''[[Abies lasiocarpa]]'' (subalpine fir).&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thick-barked trees, such as the ''[[Pinus resinosa]]'', frequently survive fire, the thin bark of spruce make them more vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Trees such as the [[Douglas fir]] withstand much of the fire due to the thicker bark they have.&lt;ref&gt;Renkin, Roy A. and Despain. “Fuel moisture, forest type, and lightning-caused fire in Yellowstone National Park.” 1992. NRC Canada: 22(1): 37–45. 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the burn mosaic during a fire, relative to species niche requirements and mobility, can have major impacts on flora and fauna dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples and characteristics ==
Forests of the Southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] had covered approximately 140&amp;nbsp;km² on peaks and ranges. Today this forest type occupies less than 70&amp;nbsp;km². Much of this forest loss is due to [[logging]], followed by slash fires.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Waterrock Knob]] fire was composed of different group of plant species than are normally found in burned spruce and fir forests. The [[tree layer]] of this stand consists of fewer than expected stems and has low basal area. The [[shrub layer]] is very dense, which may reduce successful tree reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the [[Plott Balsam mountains]], North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[herbaceous layer]] growth is not typical of young, disturbed spruce and fir stands. These vegetation characteristics suggest that possibly a hot fire in conjunction with a steep rocky slope and shallow soils have been some of the reasons for the reduced development of a typical spruce and fir stand.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; Burned soil has been an important factor in determining earlier and present vegetation patterns and species composition.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981.

== Yellowstone fire effects study ==
Post fire effects of the western United States forests include an important study of the fire of [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1988. Historically, controlled burns had been utilized to thin forests. By the 1970s, Yellowstone started a natural fire management plan to allow the process of lightning caused fires to continue influencing wild land succession.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 248 fires were started in Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As for the animals that were killed by the fires, the U.S National Park Service tallied 345 elk, 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, 9 bison and 1 grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fish were also killed due to heated water. Surveys indicated that less than 1% of the soils were heated enough to burn below ground plant seeds and roots.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S Congress launched a massive study of the long term ecological effects caused by the Yellowstone fires. The short term effects proved most wildlife populations showed no effects or rebounded quickly. In the years following the fire, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] combined with short term ash and nutrient influx led to a stunning display of wild flowers on the burned areas.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, N. A. et al. “Wildland Fire in Yellowstone.” 2007. National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 23 November 2007 &lt;http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wildlandfire.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fire ==
Because plants are immobile, they must develop resistances to disturbances through [[natural selection]]. Individual plant species vary their resistance to fire injury in predictable ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These resistances make it possible for the [[biodiversity]] to greatly increase during recolonization after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that in a spruce and fir forest, eleven years after a fire, there is a greater diversity of herbs than in a community where there was no fire.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005     &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrubs took longer to regenerate but soon there was greater diversity in the shrub population as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005 &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce and fir forests have a greater biodiversity than most other forests because of their multiple layers of [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and dense [[understories]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a heterogeneous, diverse stand structure which leads to an assortment of fire types which usually leave patches of unburned trees.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the soil is oxidized by the fire, seed germination is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many herb species were present in burned areas but not areas that were unaffected by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Gucker, Corey L. “Revegetation in a Subalpine Fir Forest after Logging and Fire in Central British Columbia.” USDA Fire Service. Fire Effects Information System. 22 November 2005 &lt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/research_project_summaries/Hamilton03/all.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Fir and spruce trees are wind-dispersed, so the number of regenerated trees depends on the distance from the unburned stands to the sample location. 

== Spruce and fir regeneration ==
The time it takes for fir and spruce to regenerate varies greatly, but it takes a number of years if no [[root]]s or [[snags]] remain. Regeneration time depends on a number of environmental factors, such as species type, wind strength, and [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be much more difficult for fir and spruce to be established on a slope, not only because of the dispersion technique, but also because erosion is greatly increased by fire, making it harder for the seeds to take root. Also, fir and spruce differ in survival techniques. Fir uses rapid growth, short lifespan, and easy establishment to come back more quickly after a fire, while spruce relies on longer lifespan and larger [[basal area]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce has a much lower establishment rate, but the larger basal area increases its chances of survival and allows it to regenerate by both [[wind dispersion]] and growth from the roots remaining after a fire. The result is that fir and spruce repopulate the site contemporaneously, although most of the initial [[biomass]] is dominated by fir and later on the dominance shifts to spruce.&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Recurrent high-intensity crown fire also helps spruce and fir forests by preventing fir from overtaking spruce through [[competitive exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Because spruce is shade-intolerant, it requires an open canopy to be established. This means that without fire to wipe out fir trees, thus creating holes in the canopy, spruce would be outcompeted by fir.&lt;ref&gt;Aplet, Gregory H. “Developmental Dynamics of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Forests of the Colorado Front Range.” 1987. Colorado State University Dissertation: 18 November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fire, insect, fungus and worm threats ==
Fire has an interesting relationship with micro fauna in forests. Damage done to trees by fire hurts the [[vascular cambium]], thus leaving trees more susceptible to insectivorous and fungal attacks. Fungal infections are not as common as insect attacks, but can be just as deadly. The fungus ''[[Amylostereum areolatum]]'' weakens trees and allows insects such as the ''[[Sirex noctilio]]'' (European wood wasp) to take over massive numbers of forests. The most common problems in spruce and fir forests are bark beetles, budworms, and [[gall]]-forming insects, to which spruce is extremely susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine. Tree Care/Landscape Contractors and Arborists. 28 September 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201063857/http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several gall-forming insects are present in spruce forests, including the Eastern Spruce gall adelgid and the Cooley's Spruce gall adelgid, which normally would not harm forests, unless the trees are unusually vulnerable to them, as they are after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine. Tree Care/Landscape Contractors and Arborists. 28 September 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201063857/http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Budworm larvae feed on the leaves of spruce and fir trees, and can become present in large amounts, which is when they become detrimental to a forest. Bark beetles are the most common insect killer of spruce and fir forests because they can spread quickly, breed rapidly, and can easily devour thousands of acres before actions can be taken against them. During the 1990s, the bark beetles affected almost three million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of spruce forests.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Tracy. “Sprucing Up.” 2007. Tree Services Magazine. Tree Care/Landscape Contractors and Arborists. 28 September 2007 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201063857/http://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/articles/sprucingup.html |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks of these insects, in turn, raise the mortality rate of trees in the burn area, which provides even more fuel for the next fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Kevin C. “Dynamic Interactions between Forest Structure and Fire Behavior in Boreal Ecosystems.” 2002. Sylva Fennica 36(1): 13-39. 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
A number of larger animals are supported by fir and spruce forests, such as moose, deer, elk, birds, snowshoe hares, and other small mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Louis and Prasad. “Potential Changes in Tree Species Richness and Forest Community Types following Climate Change.” 2001. Ecosystems 4: 186-199. 20 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Effects on [[bird]] populations after fire in fir and spruce forests varied. Of the 41 avian species observed in 3 or more studies comparing post fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22% are consistently more abundant in burned forests and 34% are more abundant in unburned forests.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, woodpeckers and aerial foragers are more abundant in burned forests and foliage grazing species are more abundant in unburned forests.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Paul Richard; Ramseur, George S.; Smathers, Garrett A. 1981. An ecological investigation of a spruce-fir burn in the Plott Balsam mountains, North Carolina. Research/Resources Management Report No. 48. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office; Cullowhee, NC: Western Carolina University, Cooperative Park Studies Unit. 16 p. [30856]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the spruce and fir community type, trees often lose their lower branches, becoming unavailable to [[hare]] and other small mammals for food or cover during the seven to nine months of winter. This makes larger mammals more densely populated in fir and spruce forests. Fire does not displace [[fauna]] that are dependent on fir and spruce forests. When fir and spruce begin sprouting, they are utilized for food and the patches of trees remaining provides shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the heterogeneity in fir and spruce forests, patches of trees are always left in nature. Fire suppression, on the other hand, alters the natural patch dynamics, thus greatly reducing the number of mammals present.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Melissa A. “Snowshoe Hare Habitat Relationships in Successional Stages of Spruce-Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Aspen Cover Types in Northwest Colorado.” 2005. Colorado State University Thesis: 29 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees all grow older, close the canopy, the understory is repressed, branches fall off during the winter, and for the majority of the year there is no available food. Also, if fire is suppressed for a number of years and then a [[crown fire]] breaks out in the area, it will quickly spread throughout the dense canopy. No patches will be left for shelter and the fir and spruce will take much longer to regenerate because of the distance from the remaining stands to the center of the burned site.

The '''Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn''' is a [[research institute]] in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], devoted to basic research in biology. Research is largely interdisciplinary involving the fields of [[evolution]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[neurobiology]], [[cell biology]], [[biological oceanography]], [[marine botany]], [[molecular plant biology]], [[benthic]] ecology, and [[ecophysiology]].

Founded in 1872 as a private concern by [[Anton Dohrn]], in 1982 the Stazione Zoologica came under the supervision and control of the Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (Ministry of Universities and Scientific and Technological Research) as a National Institute.

==History==

===The idea===
Dohrn's idea was to establish an international scientific community provided with laboratory space, equipment, research material and a library. This was supported and funded by the [[German Empire|German Government]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Francis Maitland Balfour|Francis Balfour]] and [[Charles Lyell]] among others. Dohrn provided a substantial sum himself. Running costs were paid from income derived from the [[Anton Dohrn|bench system]], the sale of scientific journals and specimens and the income from the public aquarium. This system was an important innovations in management of research and it worked.When Anton Dohrn died in 1909 more than 2,200 scientists from Europe and the United States had worked at Stazione Zoologica and more than 50 tables-per-year had been rented out.

''"Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Anton Dohrn, Professor Rolleston and Mr. P. L. Sclater, appointed for the purpose of promoting the Foundation of Zoological Stations in different parts of the World:—Reporter, Dr. Dohrn [Jena]."-"The Committee beg to report that since the last Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool steps have been taken by Dr. Dohrn to secure the moral assistance of some other scientific bodies, and that the Academy of Belgium has passed a vote acknowledging the great value of the proposed Observatories. Besides this, the Government at Berlin has given instruction to the German Embassy at Florence and to the General Consul at Naples to do everything to secure success to Dr. Dohrn's enterprise. Next October the building at Naples will be commenced under the personal superintendence of Dr. Dohrn, who will be accompanied by the assistant architect of the Berlin Aquarium. The contractors agree to finish the building in one year, so that in January 1873 the Aquarium in Naples may be expected to be in working order."'' [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] Report on the 1871 Meeting in Edinburgh

===The building===
The oldest building of the zoological station was opened in 1874. A second building connected to the western end of the first by bridges was added in 1886 and a third was built in 1906 for the new science of comparative physiology. In 1910 the 1874 building was occupied by the public aquarium and the library only, the department for collecting and preserving organisms as well as the individual laboratories for zoologists having been relocated in the 1886 addition.

===People===
[[Image:SalvatoreLoBianco.jpg|thumb|230px|Salvatore Lo Bianco in November 1889. His preservation methods were so advanced that collections of preserved marine organisms were sold to clients from all over the world]]
The first assistants were zoologists [[Nicolaus Kleinenberg]] and [[Hugo Eisig]] and one of the Preparators was Salvatore Lobianco (Lo Bianco)(1860-1910) who wrote ''The Methods Employed 
at the Naples Zoological Station for the Preservation of Marine Animals''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/details/methodsemployed00hovegoog|title=''The Methods Employed at the Naples Zoological Station for the Preservation of Marine Animals''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fstfirenze.it/collezioni/restauro/animali.htm|title= Le preparazioni di Salvatore Lo Bianco|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030902/http://www.fstfirenze.it/collezioni/restauro/animali.htm|archivedate= 2016-03-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
.Others were Dr. Brandt (librarian); Dr. Lang; Dr. Giesbrecht; Petersen (engineer). By 1910 the permanent staff were Professor Dr. [[Paul Mayer (zoologist)|Paul Mayer]] and Dr. Gross, morphology ; Dr. Burian, comparative physiology ; Dr. Henze, chemistry; Dr. Gast, the museum; Hermann Linden,secretary; Sig. Santorelli, Preparator. Zoologists and morphologists were the first guests of the new Institute. Included were [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz]], [[Francis Maitland Balfour|Francis Balfour]], [[Ray Lankester]], [[August Weismann]], [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]], [[Antonio della Valle]], [[Oskar Schmidt (zoologist)|Oskar Schmidt]], [[Ambrosius Arnold Willem Hubrecht|Ambrosius Hubrecht]] (Professor of Utrecht University, an embryologist).

===Publications===
The three publications issued by the Station were:- ''Mittheilungen der Zoologischen Station in Neapel'', ''Zoologischer Jahresbericht'' a reference journal famous for its rapid publication and accuracy and ''Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel'' an inventory of the biota of Mediterranean (in 1876 Anton Dohrn added a section of Botany),

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Library===
[[Charles Darwin]] had advised Dohrn that establishing a library would be unwise (Groeben, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;29). Dohrn argued that availability of all the major published sources was essential. He gave his own books and scientific journals to the Station and persuaded publishers and scientists to donate their publications. The Naples Station's biological reference collection is still unrivalled in Europe today.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The first librarian was Emil Schoebel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Equipment===
The station maintained a high level of technical services. [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840-1905) of the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] factory, a close friend, supplied sets of Zeiss instruments at low prices, thus bringing Zeiss equipment, sometimes improved, to the attention of the international scientific community. Assistants and guests collaborated in improving section-cutting and staining. For collecting there were several manned boats, including the steamers "Johannes Muller" and "Francis Balfour". An engineer and assisting machinists maintained the aquarium and a trained mechanic made instruments for experimental investigations.

===The aquarium===
The aquarium was constructed by [[William Alford Lloyd]] [http://www.parlouraquariums.org.uk/]. Dohrn had met 
Lloyd in 1866 in [[Tierpark Hagenbeck|Hamburg]].

===Culture===
Anton Dohrn followed [[Goethean science|Goethe]] in considering arts and science inseparable. He was devoted to music and in 1873 employed [[Hans von Marées]] (1837-1887) and [[Adolf von Hildebrand]] to enhance Stazione Zoologica with art works.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later history==
Anton Dohrn's son Reinhard Dohrn (1880-1962) continued his father's work from 1909. Peter Dohrn (1917-2007) acted as Director between 1954 and 1967. From 1967 to 1976 SZN was led by a Commissario Straordinario.In 1976 following the appointment of Alberto Monroy, an embryologist, as Director a radical reorganisation began. SZN was divided into five parts: Biological Oceanography, Benthic Ecology (at the Villa Dohrn in Ischia), Biochemistry, Cell and Developmental Biology and Neurobiology and. In 1982 SZN became an "Ente pubblico di ricerca (National Research Institute) under the directorship of Antonio Miralto.In 1987 Gaetano Salvatore, Dean of the Medical School of Università Federico II in Napoli, was appointed President of the Stazione Zoologica. After his death in 1997 Professor Giorgio Bernardi was appointed as President. He launched the study of [[molecular evolution]] "at the institutional level" completing Dohrn's vision.

In mathematics, the '''Sugeno integral''', named after M.&amp;nbsp;Sugeno,&lt;ref&gt;Sugeno, M., Theory of fuzzy integrals and its applications, Doctoral. Thesis,  Tokyo Institute of Technology, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of integral with respect to a [[fuzzy measure theory|fuzzy measure]].

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measurable space]] and let &lt;math&gt;h:X\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable function]].

The Sugeno integral over the [[crisp set]] &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; of the function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the fuzzy measure &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\int_A h(x) \circ g 
= {\sup_{E\subseteq X}} \left[\min\left(\min_{x\in E} h(x), g(A\cap E)\right)\right]
= {\sup_{\alpha\in [0,1]}} \left[\min\left(\alpha, g(A\cap F_\alpha)\right)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_\alpha = \left\{x | h(x) \geq \alpha \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Sugeno integral over the [[fuzzy set]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' of the function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the fuzzy measure &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_A h(x) \circ g 
= \int_X \left[h_A(x) \wedge h(x)\right] \circ g 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the membership function of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25192">'''Time-Sensitive Networking''' ('''TSN''') is a set of standards under development by the Time-Sensitive Networking task group of the [[IEEE 802.1]] working group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/tsn.html Time - Sensitive networking task Group]&lt;/ref&gt; The TSN task group was formed in November 2012 by renaming the existing [[Audio Video Bridging|Audio Video Bridging Task Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/avbridges.html Audio Video Bridging Task Group]&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing its work. The name changed as a result of extension of the working area of the standardization group. The standards define mechanisms for the time-sensitive transmission of data over [[Ethernet]] networks.

The majority of projects define extensions to the IEEE 802.1Q{{snd}} [[Virtual LAN]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html  Virtual LANs]&lt;/ref&gt; These extensions in particular address the transmission of very low transmission latency and high availability. Possible applications include converged networks with real time Audio/Video Streaming and real-time control streams which are used in automotive or industrial control facilities.

Work is also currently being carried out in [[AVnu Alliance]]{{'}}s specially created Industrial group to define Compliance &amp; Interoperability requirements for TSN networked elements. 
== Key components ==
The different TSN standards documents that are specified by IEEE 802.1 can be grouped into three basic key component categories that are required for a complete real-time communication solution. Each and every standard specification can be used on its own and is mostly self-sufficient. However, only when used together in a concerted way, TSN as a communication system can achieve its full potential. The three basic components are:
# Time synchronization: All devices that are participating in real-time communication need to have a common understanding of time
# Scheduling and traffic shaping: All devices that are participating in real-time communication adhere to the same rules in processing and forwarding communication packets
# Selection of communication paths, path reservations and fault-tolerance: All devices that are participating in real-time communication adhere to the same rules in selecting communication paths and in reserving bandwidth and time slots, possibly utilizing more than one simultaneous path to achieve fault-tolerance

=== Time Synchronization ===
The name "Time-sensitive networking" is already quite descriptive in this regard: In contrast to standard [[Ethernet]] according to [[IEEE 802.3]] and Ethernet bridging according to [http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html IEEE 802.1Q], time plays an important role in TSN networks. For [[Real-time computing|real-time]] communication with hard, non-negotiable time boundaries for end-to-end transmission latencies, all devices in this network need to have a common time reference and therefore, need to synchronize their clocks among each other. This is not only true for the end devices of a communication stream, such as an industrial controller and a manufacturing robot, but also true for network components, such as [[Ethernet switch]]es. Only through synchronized clocks, it is possible for all network devices to operate in unison and execute the required operation at exactly the required point in time.

Time synchronization in TSN networks can be achieved with different technologies. Theoretically, it is possible to outfit every end device and network switch with a [[GPS clock]]. However, this is costly and there is no guarantee that the Radio or GPS clock has access to the radio or satellite signal at all times - for example if the network is installed in a moving car, on a factory floor or in a tunnel deep beneath the surface of the earth. Due to these constraints, time in TSN networks is usually distributed from one central time source directly through the network itself. In most cases, this is done using the [[Precision Time Protocol|IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol]], which utilizes Ethernet frames to distribute time synchronization information. In addition to the universally applicable IEEE 1588 specification, the Time-Sensitive Task Group of the [[IEEE 802.1]] committee has specified a profile of IEEE 1588, called [[IEEE 802.1AS]]. The idea behind this profile is to narrow the huge list of different IEEE 1588 options down to a manageable few critical options that are applicable to Home networks or networks in automotive car or industrial automation environments.

=== Scheduling and traffic shaping ===
Scheduling and traffic shaping allows for the coexistence of different traffic classes with different priorities on the same network - each with different requirements to available bandwidth and end-to-end latency. Standard bridging according to IEEE 802.1q uses eight distinct priorities with a strict priority scheme. On the protocol level, these priorities are visible in the [[802.1Q VLAN tag]] of a standard [[Ethernet frame]]. These priorities already allow to distinguish between more important and less important network traffic, but even with the highest of the eight priorities, no absolute guarantee for an end-to-end delivery time can be given. The reason for this are buffering effects inside the Ethernet switches. If a switch has started the transmission of an Ethernet frame on one of its ports, even the highest priority frame has to wait inside the switch buffer for this transmission to finish. With standard Ethernet switching, this non-determinism cannot be avoided. This is not an issue in environments where applications do not depend on the timely delivery of single Ethernet frames - such as office IT infrastructures. In these environments, file transfers, emails or other business applications have limited time sensitivity themselves and are usually protected by other mechanisms further up the protocol stack, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]]. In industrial automation and automotive car environments, however, where [[Closed-loop control|closed loop control]] or [[Functional safety|safety]] applications are using the Ethernet network, reliable and timely delivery is of utmost importance. For Ethernet to be used here, the strict priority scheduling of IEEE 802.1Q needs to be enhanced.

==== Different time slices for different traffic classes - the IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler ====
TSN enhances standard Ethernet communication by adding mechanisms to ensure timely delivery with soft and hard real-time requirements. The mechanism of utilizing the eight distinct VLAN priorities is retained, to ensure complete backwards compatibility to non-TSN Ethernet. This has always been one of the design principles of the IEEE 802 group when developing Ethernet further - maintain backwards compatibility to maintain interoperability with the existing infrastructure and to allow a seamless migration towards new technologies.

With TSN, for each of the eight priorities, a user can select from different mechanisms how Ethernet frames are processed and priorities can be individually assigned to already existing methods (such as the IEEE 802.1Q strict priority scheduler) or new processing methods, such as the TSN IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware traffic scheduler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bv.html IEEE 802.1Qbv]&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical use case for TSN is the communication of a Programmable Logic Controller ([[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]) with an [[industrial robot]] through an Ethernet network. To achieve transmission times with guaranteed end-to-end latency that can support the closed loop control that is operating between the PLC and the robot, one or several of the eight Ethernet priorities can be assigned to the IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler. This scheduler is designed to separate the communication on the Ethernet network into fixed length, repeating time cycles. Within these cycles, different time slices can be configured that can be assigned to one or several of the eight Ethernet priorities. By doing this, it is possible to grant exclusive use - for a limited time - to the Ethernet transmission medium for those traffic classes that need transmission guarantees and can't be interrupted. The basic concept is a [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) scheme. By establishing virtual communication channels for specific time periods, time-critical communication can be separated from non-critical background traffic. By granting exclusive access to the transmission medium and devices to time-critical traffic classes, the buffering effects in the Ethernet switch transmission buffers can be avoided and time-critical traffic can be transmitted without non-deterministic interruptions. One example for an IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler configuration is visible in figure 1:
[[File:Figure 1- Example IEEE 802.1Qbv schedule.svg|figure 1: Example IEEE 802.1Qbv schedule|none|thumb|957x957px]]

In this example, each cycle consists of two time slices. Time slice 1 only allows the transmission of traffic tagged with VLAN priority 3, and time slice 2 in each cycle allows for the rest of the priorities to be sent. Since the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler requires all clocks on all network devices (Ethernet switches and end devices) to be synchronized and the identical schedule to be configured, all devices understand which priority can be sent to the network at any given point in time. Since time slice 2 has more than one priority assigned to it, within this time slice, the priorities are handled according to standard IEEE 802.1Q strict priority scheduling.

This separation of Ethernet transmissions into cycles and time slices can be enhanced further by the inclusion of other scheduling or traffic shaping algorithms, such as the [[Audio Video Bridging|Audio- and Video Bridging]] traffic shaper IEEE 802.1Qav. IEEE 802.1Qav supports soft real-time.  In this particular example, IEEE 802.1Qav could be assigned to one or two of the priorities that are used in time slice two to distinguish further between audio/video traffic and background file transfers. The [http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/tsn.html IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking Task Group] specifies a number of different schedulers and traffic shapers that can be combined to achieve the nonreactive coexistence of hard real-time, soft real-time and background traffic on the same Ethernet infrastructure.

==== IEEE 802.1Qbv in more detail: Time slices and guard bands ====
When an Ethernet interface has started the transmission of a frame to the transmission medium, this transmission has to be completely finished before another transmission can take place. This includes the transmission of the [[CRC32]] checksum at the end of the frame to ensure a reliable, fault-free transmission. This inherent property of Ethernet networks - again- poses a challenge to the TDMA approach of the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler. This is visible in figure 2:
[[File:IEEE 802.1Qbv - time slice infringement.svg|figure 2: Frame that is sent too late in the best effort time slice infringes the high-priority time slice|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Just before the end of time slice 2 in cycle n, a new frame transmission is started. Unfortunately, this frame is too large to fit into its time slice. Since the transmission of this frame cannot be interrupted, the frame infringes the following time slice 1 of the next cycle n+1. By partially or completely blocking a time-critical time slice, real-time frames can be delayed up to the point where they cannot meet the application requirements any longer. This is very similar to the actual buffering effects that happen in non-TSN Ethernet switches, so TSN has to specify a mechanism to prevent this from happening.

The IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler has to ensure that the Ethernet interface is not busy with the transmission of a frame when the scheduler changes from one time slice into the next. The time-aware scheduler achieves this by putting a guard band in front of every time slice that carries time-critical traffic. During this guard band time, no new Ethernet frame transmission may be started, only already ongoing transmissions may be finished. The duration of this guard band has to be as long as it takes the maximum frame size to be safely transmitted. For an Ethernet frame according to IEEE 802.3 with a single IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag and including [[Interpacket gap|interframe spacing]], the total length is: 1500 byte (frame payload) + 18 byte (ethernet addresses, ethertype and CRC) + 4 byte (VLAN Tag) + 12 byte (Interframe spacing) + 8 byte (preamble and SFD) = 1542 byte.

The total time needed for sending this frame is dependant on the link speed of the Ethernet network. With Fast Ethernet and 100 Mbit/s transmission rate, the transmission duration is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;t_{maxframe} = \frac{1542\ byte}{12.5 \cdot 10^6\ byte \cdot \frac{1}{s}} = 123.36 \cdot 10^{-6} s&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the guard band has to be at least 123.36&amp;nbsp;µs long. With the guard band, the total bandwidth / time that is usable within a time slice is reduced by the length of the guard band. This is visible in figure 3:
[[File:TSN IEEE 802.1Qbv Example with guard band.svg|figure 3: Guard bands prevent the infringement of time slices with critical traffic|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Note: to facilitate the presentation of the topic, the actual size of the guard band in figure 3 is not to scale, but is significantly smaller than indicated by the frame in figure 2.

In this example, the time slice 1 always contains high priority data (e.g. for motion control), while time slice 2 always contains best effort data.Therefore, a guard band needs to be placed at every transition point into time slice 1 to protect the time slice of the critical data stream(s).

While the guard bands manage to protect the time slices with high priority, critical traffic, they also have some significant drawbacks:
* The time that is consumed by a guard band is lost - it cannot be used to transmit any data, as the Ethernet port needs to be silent. Therefore, the lost time directly translates in lost bandwidth for background traffic on that particular Ethernet link.
* A single time slice can never be configured smaller than the size of the guard band. Especially with lower speed Ethernet connections and growing guard band size, this has a negative impact on the lowest achievable time slice length and cycle time.
To partially mitigate the loss of bandwidth through the guard band, the standard IEEE 802.1Qbv includes a length-aware scheduling mechanism. This mechanism is used when [[Network switch|store-and-forward switching]] is utilized: after the full reception of an Ethernet frame that needs to be transmitted on a port where the guard band is in effect, the scheduler checks the overall length of the frame. If the frame can fit completely inside the guard band, without any infringement of the following high priority slice, the scheduler can send this frame, despite an active guard band, and reduce the waste of bandwidth. This mechanism, however, cannot be used when [[cut-through switching]] is enabled, since the total length of the Ethernet frame needs to be known a priori. Therefore, when cut-through switching is used to minimize end-to-end latency, the waste of bandwidth will still occur. Also, this does not help with the minimum achievable cycle time. Therefore, length-aware scheduling is an improvement, but cannot mitigate all drawbacks that are introduced by the guard band.

==== Frame pre-emption and minimizing the guard band ====
To further mitigate the negative effects from the guard bands, the IEEE working groups 802.1 and [http://www.ieee802.org/3/ 802.3] have specified the frame pre-emption technology. The two working groups collaborated in this endeavour, since the technology required both changes in the Ethernet [[Media access control|Media Access Control (MAC)]] scheme that is under the control of IEEE 802.3, as well as changes in the management mechanisms that are under the control of IEEE 802.1. Due to this fact, frame pre-emption is described in two different standards documents: IEEE 802.1Qbu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bu.html IEEE 802.1Qbu]&lt;/ref&gt; for the bridge management component and IEEE 802.3br&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/br/index.html IEEE 802.3br]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Ethernet MAC component.
[[File:TSN frame pre-emption.svg|Figure 4: Example of frame pre-emption|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Figure 4 gives a basic example how frame pre-emption works. During the process of sending a best effort Ethernet frame, the MAC interrupts the frame transmission just before the start of the guard band. The partial frame is completed with a CRC and will be stored in the next switch to wait for the second part of the frame to arrive. After the high priority traffic in time slice 1 has passed and the cycle switches back to time slice 2, the interrupted frame transmission is resumed. Frame pre-emption always operates on a pure link-by-link basis and only fragments from one Ethernet switch to the next Ethernet switch, where the frame is reassembled. In contrast to [[Internet Protocol|fragmentation with the Internet Protocol (IP)]], no end-to-end fragmentation is supported.

Each partial frame is completed by a CRC32 for error detection. In contrast to the regular Ethernet CRC32, the last 16 bit are inverted to make a partial frame distinguishable from a regular Ethernet frame. In addition, also the [[start of frame delimiter]] (SFD) is changed.

The support for frame pre-emption has to be activated on each link between devices individually. To signal the capability for frame pre-emption on a link, an Ethernet switch announces this capability through the [[Link Layer Discovery Protocol|LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)]]. When a device receives such an LLDP announcement on a network port and supports frame pre-emption itself, it may activate the capability. There is no direct negotiation and activation of the capability on adjacent devices. Any device that receives the LLDP pre-emption announcement assumes that on the other end of the link, a device is present that can understand the changes in the frame format (changed CRC32 and SFD).

Frame pre-emption allows for a significant reduction of the guard band. The length of the guard band is now dependant on the precision of the frame pre-emption mechanism: how small is the minimum size of the frame that the mechanism can still pre-empt. IEEE 802.3br specifies the best accuracy for this mechanism at 64 byte - due to the fact that this is the minimum size of a still valid Ethernet frame. In this case, the guard band can be reduced to a total of 127 byte: 64 byte (minimum frame) + 63 byte (remaining length that cannot be pre-empted). All larger frames can be pre-empted again and therefore, there is no need to protect against this size with a guard band.

This minimizes the best effort bandwidth that is lost and also allows for much shorter cycle times at slower Ethernet speeds, such as 100 Mbit/s and below. Since the pre-emption takes place in hardware in the MAC, as the frame passes through, cut-through switching can be supported as well, since the overall frame size is not needed a priori. The MAC interface just checks in regular 64 byte intervals whether the frame needs to be pre-empted or not.

The combination of time synchronization, the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler and frame pre-emption already constitutes an effective set of standards that can be utilized to guarantee the coexistence of different traffic categories on a network while also providing end-to-end latency guarantees. This will be enhanced further as new IEEE 802.1 specifications, such as 802.1Qch are finalized.

=== Selection of communication paths, reservation and fault-tolerance ===
The TSN technology, especially the time-aware scheduler according to IEEE 802.1Qbv, have been developed for use in mission-critical network environments. In these networks, not only are timing guarantees relevant, but fault-tolerance is as well. Networks that support applications such as safety-relevant control loops or autonomous driving in vehicles have to be protected against faults in hardware or network media. The TSN task group is currently specifying the fault-tolerance protocol IEEE 802.1CB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1cb.html IEEE 802.1CB]&lt;/ref&gt; for this purpose. In addition to this protocol, existing high-availability protocols such as [[High-availability Seamless Redundancy|HSR]] or [[Parallel Redundancy Protocol|PRP]] that are specified in IEC 62439-3, can be utilized.

To register fault-tolerant communication streams across a network, Path control and reservation as specified in IEEE 802.1Qca,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1ca.html IEEE 802.1Qca]&lt;/ref&gt; manual configuration or vendor-specific solutions can be used.

In the currently ongoing project IEEE 802.1Qcc, the TSN task group focuses on the definition of management interfaces and protocols to enable TSN network administration on large scale networks. Three different aspects are discussed here, both with a de-centralized approach as well as a fully centralized approach that re-uses configuration concepts from [[Software-defined networking|software-defined networking (SDN)]]. The current discussion can be followed through the public document archive of IEEE 802.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/ public document archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human sexuality]], '''top''', '''bottom''' and '''versatile''' are [[sex position]]s during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[Men who have sex with men|between two men]]. A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.  A ''{{visible anchor|service top}}'' is "one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom".&lt;ref name="DJ Symptomatic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Carissa|title=It's Symptomatic|url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/its-symptomatic...-by-carissa-rodriguez|website=Document Journal|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile top}}'' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatiletop.htm Versatile Top].

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233–9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "Männer, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, Präventionsmedizin für den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D.

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''Männlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: Ennennäkemätöntä – Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming – How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles].

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17923">The '''two-step flow of communication model''' says that most people form their opinions under the influence of [[opinion leader]]s, who in turn are influenced by the [[mass media]]. In contrast to the one-step flow of the [[Hypodermic needle model|hypodermic needle model or magic bullet theory]], which holds that people are directly influenced by mass media, according to the two-step flow model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. Opinion leaders pass on their own interpretation of information in addition to the actual media content.

== Basic overview ==
The theory is based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders. The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand, through the personal influence of opinion leaders.

== Concept ==
The two-step model says that most people are not directly influenced by mass media, and instead form their opinions based on opinion leaders who interpret media messages and put them into context. Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content, and who interpret it based on their own opinion. They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the [[general public]] who become "opinion followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baran|first=Stanley|title=Theories of Mass Communication|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0767421906/student_view0/chapter12/glossary.html|work=Introduction to Mass Communication|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "opinion leaders" gain their influence through more elite media as opposed to mainstream [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence|newspaper=New York: Free Press|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, [[social influence]] is created and adjusted by the ideals and opinions of each specific "elite media" group, and by these media group's opposing ideals and opinions and in combination with popular mass media sources. Therefore, the leading influence in these opinions is primarily a social persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
The two-step flow of communication model hypothesizes that ideas flow from mass media to [[opinion leader]]s, and from them to a wider population.  It was first introduced by [[sociologist]] [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] ''et al.'' in 1944&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], Hazel Gaudet, ''The people's choice: how the voter makes up his mind in a presidential campaign'', Columbia University Press, 1944, p. 151''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborated by [[Elihu Katz]] and Lazarsfeld in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elihu Katz  |author2=Paul Felix Lazarsfeld |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4| pages=309''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elihu Katz|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on a Hypothesis|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|date=Spring 1957|pages= 61–78|jstor=2746790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery and DeFleur argue the book was much more than a simple research report: it was an effort to interpret the authors' research within a framework of conceptual schemes, theoretical issues, and research findings drawn broadly from the scientific study of small groups &lt;ref&gt;Lowery &amp; DeFleur, "Milestones In Mass Communication Research" ''Personal influence: Two-Step Flow of Communication'', Longman Inc., 1983, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[hypodermic needle model]], which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency.

For example, in the field of [[science communication]], Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the "masses" through [[opinion leadership]]. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.

Based on the two-step flow hypothesis, the term "personal influence" came to illustrate the process intervening between the media's direct message and the audience's reaction to that message. Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influence—based on personality, interests, demographics, or socio-economic factors. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors. The two-step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences' attitudes. This hypothesis provided a basis for the two-step flow theory of [[mass communication]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two Step Flow Theory." Opleidingswebsite Communicatiewetenschap (CW) En Communication Studies (CS).

=== Contemporary debate ===

In the times of digital social media, the more than six decade old theory sparks much new interest. The fact that massive databases are being used to send tailor-made messages to individuals lead back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is a kind of [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic needle / magic bullet model]], with the capacity of [[big data]] analytics informed [[mass customization]]. Empirical studies by other scholars, in contrast, have found that modern [[social media]] platforms, like [[Twitter]], exhibit clear evidence of a two-step flow of communication (see Figure).&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests].

The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[social media]] users obtain their news from [[celebrities]] or other amplifying opinion leaders, who again get informed by [[mass media]] or by individuals with specific insights. The fine-grained digital footprint of [[social media]] also suggests that there are more than simply the one-step and two-step modes of communication flow, leading the search for more complex '''Multistep Flow Models''' based on distinct network structures.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K.

== Lazarsfeld and Katz ==

Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz are considered to be the founders of functional theory and their book ''Personal Influence'' (1955) is considered to be the handbook to the theory.

=== Paul Felix Lazarsfeld ===
One of the first to embark on Communications research, was the first to introduce the difference between 'administrative research' and 'critical research' in regards to the media. Critical research he believed, criticizes the media institutions themselves for the perspective ways they serve dominant social groups. Critical research favors interperspective and inductive methods of inquiry.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lazarsfeld's study of the 1940 presidential election was published as ''The People's Choice'' (1944). During the research revealed information about the psychological and social processes that influence voting decisions. The study also uncovered an influence process that Lazarsfeld called "opinion leadership." He concluded that there is a multistep flow of information from the mass media to persons who serve as opinion leaders which then is passed on to the general public. He called this communication process the "two-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul F. Lazarsfeld Biography|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/paul-f-lazarsfeld/|publisher=Book Rags Inc.|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elihu Katz ===
[[Elihu Katz]] was a professor in the School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania when he collaborated with Lazarsfeld in 1955. Their research aimed to observe the flow of influence at the intersections of mass and interpersonal communication and resulted in the book ''Personal Influence''. Katz pursued Lazarfeld's research in a study of the flow of information, which is the basis of ''Personal Influence''. Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that:
"... the traditional image of the mass persuasion process must make room for 'people' as intervening factors between the stimuli of the media and resultant opinions, decisions, and actions."&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"/&gt;

== Published works on the theory ==
=== ''The People's Choice'' ===
The presidential election of 1940 saw President Franklin Roosevelt seek an unprecedented third term in office. Funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Life magazine, and the pollster [[Elmo Roper]], Columbia's Office of Radio Research conducted a study of voting. It was based on a panel study of 2,400 voters in Erie County, Ohio. Paul Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], and [[Hazel Gaudet]] supervised 15 interviewers, who from May–October interviewed the strategically selected 2,400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign. They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed.
''The People's Choice'', a book based on this study presented the theory of  "the two-step flow of communications", which later came to be associated with the so-called "limited effects model" of mass media: the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local "opinion leaders" who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge, or "opinion followers." The results of the research led to the conclusion that sometimes person to person communication can be more effective than traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV, radio etc. This idea developed further in the book ''Personal Influence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ERIE COUNTY STUDY (The People's Choice)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Personal Influence'' ===
In 1944, Paul Lazarsfeld contacted McFadden Publications in regards to his first book, ''The People's Choice''. The two collaborated forming a mutually beneficial partnership in which Macfadden saw a way to financially profit from advertising to the female population and Lazarsfeld saw a way to gain more information on social influence. Out of this came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur, Illinois, where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making. Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C. Wright Mills to head the study. Another part of the research team, Thelma Ehrlich Anderson, trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town. By 1955. the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's book ''Personal Influence''. The book concluded that ultimately, face to face interaction is more influential than traditional media influence and thus confirmed the two-step flow model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DECATUR COUNTY STUDY (Personal Influence)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The original two-step flow hypothesis—that ideas flow from the media to opinion leaders and then to less active sections of the population—has been criticized and negated by myriad consequent studies. Findings from Deutschmann and Danielson assert, "we would urge that the Katz-Lazarsfeld two-stage flow hypothesis, as a description of the initial information process, be applied to mass communication with caution".&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Deutschmann, Wayne A. Danielson (1960) "Diffusion of Knowledge Of the Major News Story" Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly September 1960 vol. 37 no. 3 p345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; They find substantial evidence that initial mass media information flows directly to people on the whole and is not relayed by opinion leaders.

Furthermore, the two-step hypothesis does not adequately describe the flow of learning. Everett Rogers' "Diffusion of Innovations"&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations, New York, Free Press of Glencoe, 1962, pp. 98-102&lt;/ref&gt; cites one study&lt;ref&gt;Lionberger, H. F. (1960). "Adoption of new ideas and practices: a summary of the research dealing with the acceptance of technological change in agriculture, with implications for action in facilitating such change" (No. 301.35 L763). Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which two-thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face-to-face communication. Similarly, critics argue that most of Lazarsfeld's findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information. Both findings suggest a greater prevalence of a one-step flow of communication.

However, Lazarsfeld's two-step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the media's influence on belief and behavior. Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion, at which point opinion leaders initiate the second-step flow.&lt;ref&gt;Troldahl, Verling C. "A Field Test of a Modified "Two-Step Flow of Communication" Model." Public Opinion Quarterly 30.4 (2001): 609-23. Academic Search Premier. Web. 11 Apr. 2010. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings also realize opinion leaders' decisive role in the balance theory, which suggests that people are motivated to keep consistency among their current beliefs and opinions. If a person is exposed to new observations that are inconsistent with present beliefs, he or she is thrown into imbalance. This person will then seek advice from their opinion leader, to provide them with additional cognitions to bring them back into balance. In addition, this theory may be valid during the era when opinion leaders were the only ones to have easy access to media contents. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Today, there is a free flow of information so that anybody could have access to media contents without relying substantially on opinion leaders.

[[Empirical research]] that analyzes vast databases from communication flows in [[social media]] finds that today's digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90 % of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; This shows that the two-step model does not seem to be dead, nor obsolete, but simply one of several ways communication flows in modern networks.

In aerospace engineering, the '''ultimate load''' is a statistical figure used in calculations, and should (hopefully) never actually occur.

Strength requirements are specified in terms of [[limit loads]] (the maximum loads to be expected in service) and ultimate loads (limit loads multiplied by prescribed factors of safety). With respect to aircraft structure and design, ultimate load is the amount of load applied to a component beyond which the component will fail.  The chance that it will occur is, however, not zero, and, if it were to occur, then the relevant structure in the [[aircraft]] would stand a large chance of fracture.  

During the testing for determination of the loads, no fracture must occur at the ultimate load for a period of 3 seconds.

This also majorly used in knowing the properties of a metal beams, for example it is used in experiments such as called T.T.M(tensile testing machine), U.T.M(universal testing machine) 

The ultimate load is related to the [[limit load (aeronautics)|limit load]] B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, using the concept of [[Factor of safety|safety factor]], j. The relation is as follows:

B&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;= 1.5 B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

The '''University for Peace''' ('''UPEACE''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] with university status, established by [[treaty]] in 1980 and having its main campus in [[Costa Rica]]. Its stated mission is "to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]." The current Rector of UPEACE is Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:UPEACE-campus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Costa Rica campus]]

The creation of the University for Peace was set in motion by a treaty and endorsed by resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. By this Resolution, the UN General Assembly established an international commission which, in collaboration with the Government of Costa Rica, was requested to prepare the organization, structure and setting in motion of the University for Peace. Thereafter, by [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf Resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution on Establishment of UPEACE|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN General Assembly endorsed the treaty establishing  the University for Peace by adopting the [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201223/volume-1223-I-19735-English.pdf International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace] (UPEACE) along with the [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf Charter of the University for Peace].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the University for Peace annexed to the International Agreement Establishing the University for Peace|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University has the unique status of not only being a dedicated institution for higher education in Peace and Conflict studies, but also an international treaty body organization mandated by the United Nations General Assembly.

It offers [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm master's degree and doctoral programmes] at its main headquarters in [[San José, Costa Rica]], and carries out various activities related to the international peace and security objectives of the [[United Nations]] (UN) through centres and offices located in Addis Ababa, Geneva, New York, The Hague, and South Korea, and through partnership arrangements with numerous other institutions worldwide.

=== Relationship with United Nations ===

The University for Peace is part of the academic wing of the UN system, and has observer status at the UN General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See 'Other Resources' at http://www.un.org/en/peace/ |url=https://www.un.org/en/peace/|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining its [[academic freedom|independence in academic]], financial and management matters. The [[UN Secretary-General]] is the Honorary President of UPEACE. The UN General Assembly maintains a constant interest in the activities of UPEACE, and in periodic resolutions calls on the UN Secretary-General to report to it on its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/83|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/466/81/PDF/N0946681.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the UN Secretary-General reports to the General Assembly of the UN periodically on the progress of UPEACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the UN Secretary General on the University for Peace, A/64/281, dated 11 August 2009.|url=http://www.upeace.org/PDF/SG's%20Report%20-%202009%20(English).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council of the University for Peace is the supreme authority of the University.

== Headquarters and main campus ==

The University for Peace has its headquarters in Costa Rica, a country distinguished by a long tradition of democracy. Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, H.E. [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation - not to mention the friendly locals. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&amp;nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.

The Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm Masters programmes] and its recently announced [http://www.upeace.org/academic/doctorate/ Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [http://www.upeace.org/faculty/index.cfm faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [http://www.upeace.org/calendar/index.cfm academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [http://www.upeace.org/academic/distance/ distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.

The University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [http://www.centre.upeace.org/ UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.

The University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.

The Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is "to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace." This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.

In addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.

== Around the world ==

'''Africa'''

As a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.

The University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.

The first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.

In a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.

'''Europe'''

In January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace &amp; Conflict Studies, Water &amp; Peace, and Urban Peace &amp; Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.

The Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.

'''Asia-Pacific'''

In 2010, the [http://upeaceap.org UPEACE Asia Pacific Centre] (UPAPC) was established in Seoul, The Republic of Korea. The Centre carries out important activities as a think tank for development studies and provides post-graduate training programmes(Masters) in The Republic of  Korea. The Republic of Korea acceded to the International Agreement for the establishment of the University for Peace and Charter of the University for Peace on June 11, 2010.

'''Asia'''

The [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students have also the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.

'''Affiliated institutions'''

Article 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: "the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education." The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogotá, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres’ mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.

The '''Waterfront Historic Area LeaguE''', also known as '''WHALE''', is a non-profit [[historic preservation]] organization located in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].  Its mission is: "to promote the value and reuse of greater New Bedford's historic structures through preservation, education and advocacy".&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"&gt;WHALE - Waterfront Historic Area League. 26 May 2009 &lt;http://www.waterfrontleague.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization often promotes its cause with the words of one of its founders, Sarah Delano (President of WHALE, 1966-1982).  Delano said, "if you bulldoze your heritage, you become just anywhere".&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995"&gt;McCabe, Marsha, and Joseph D. Thomas. Not Just Anywhere. New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

                                                                  
== History ==

The organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens in 1962, at a time when urban renewal threatened much of the city's history and architectural heritage.  The original focus was on the city's waterfront district, a dense area of [[whaling]] era buildings suffering from severe neglect and disrepair.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995" /&gt;  WHALE took on the preservation/restoration of as many as 20 buildings within the district's boundaries over the years.  This became the organization's first neighborhood revitalization project and lead to the establishment of Bedford Landing Waterfront National Register [[Historic District]].  With WHALE's leadership, the district would later be designated, [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]].&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;  Over time, WHALE expanded to properties beyond this district, taking on preservation projects throughout the city.  WHALE has now completed over 45 preservation and restoration projects in the greater New Bedford area between 1962 and 2009.&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;
