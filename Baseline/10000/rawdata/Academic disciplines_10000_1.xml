The '''argument from poor design''', also known as the '''[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument''', is an argument against the [[Existence of God|existence of]] a [[Creator deity|creator]] [[God]], based on the reasoning that an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and  [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God would not create [[organism]]s with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic [[modus tollens]]: if "creation" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.

Although the phrase "argument from poor design" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as "poor design", "suboptimal design", "unintelligent design" or "[[Dysteleology|dysteology/dysteological]]". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.&lt;ref name="haeckel"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of "a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''".&lt;ref name="haeckel"/&gt;  The term "incompetent design", a play on "[[intelligent design]]", has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald |date=2005-07-22 |title="Intelligent" Design versus Evolution |journal=Science |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=556–557 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c |pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its [[free will]] to rebel against God&lt;!--[?:], and the consequent damage from hostile spiritual forces,--&gt; has resulted in the corruption of good design.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hahne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K-Ls4CUEWFAC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;f=false ''The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;f=false ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KJQyhzY4PucC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]

The argument runs that:

# An [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator God [[Creation myth|would create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

"Poor design" is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In [[fitness landscape]] terms, natural selection will always push "up the hill", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', 6th ed., Ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In humans===

====Fatal flaws====
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Ectopic.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|Artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[watchmaker analogy]]'.]]
Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]'s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and [[gangrene]], usually resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Colby |author2=Loren Petrich |year=1993 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |title=Evidence for Jury-Rigged Design in Nature |publisher=[[Talk.Origins]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/615A4Dvf5?url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]]. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of [[oxygen]] but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide.  A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] is a [[vestigial organ]] with no known purpose (suggested purposes are either unproven or incidental/non-essential){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and no deleterious effects come from its removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However [[appendicitis]], an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention.

====Other flaws====
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot,&lt;ref name="selim"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |date=June 2004 |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817155923/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |archivedate=2011-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The [[spinal cord]] cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association."

* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishikimi M, Yagi K |title=Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=54 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1203S–1208S |date=December 1991 |pmid=1962571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of vitamin C results in [[scurvy]] and eventually death. The gene is also non-functional in other [[primate]]s and in [[guinea pig]]s, but is functional in most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta Y, Nishikimi M |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochim.

* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]].
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]], which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Wisdom Teeth."

* The structure of [[human eye|humans' eye]]s (as well as those of all vertebrates). The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. "The Retina." of the Human Eye. N.p., n.d.

===Other life===

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Other animals|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the [[giraffe]], this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The [[Tetrachromacy|loss of tetrachromatic vision]] by mammals as compared to other tetrapods.
* The enzyme [[RuBisCO]] has been described as a "notoriously inefficient" enzyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME |title=Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=449–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12221984 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a [[competitive inhibition|competitive enzyme inhibitor]]. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]], and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Biochemistry: Tackling unintelligent design |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7278 |pages=164–5 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20075906 |doi=10.1038/463164a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite its being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various [[vestigial]] body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land).
* [[Turritopsis dohrnii]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] genus have [[biological immortality]], but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a [[supernormal stimulus]] - like a [[moth]] flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as [[chlorophyll]] absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* [[Albatross]]es cannot take off or land properly.

== Criticism ==

===Unproven assumptions===
Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a [[Creator deity]] would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] in the [[Book of Job]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Book of Job]] goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Optimal design engineering and trade-offs===
Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a [[trade-off]] to improve overall optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fazale|first=Rana|title=Responding to a Skeptic|url=http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|accessdate=2018-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927013720/http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific examples===
[[Intelligent design]] proponent [[William Dembski]] questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between "intelligent design" and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembski |first=William |authorlink=William Dembski |title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8308-2314-X |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[John Woodmorappe]] on the [[Creation Ministries International]] website says that the [[Sesamoid bone|panda's "thumb"]] works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|title=Panda thumbs its nose at the dysteleological arguments of the atheist Stephen Jay Gould - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130704051258/http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[veriform appendix|appendix]] has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.  In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren G. |last=Martin |date=October 21, 1999 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |title=What is the function of the human appendix? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009062840/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|title=Is our 'inverted' retina really 'bad design'? - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130627193627/http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|title=Mueller cells backwardly wired retina v Dawkins - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130626233057/http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==

In addition, the [[plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. "Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population."&lt;ref name=selim/&gt;

In response to the claim that uses have been found for "junk" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include [[pseudogenes]] that are nonfunctional "junk", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Isaak |year=2004 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |title=Claim CB130 |publisher=Talk.Origins |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911070043/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotsune | first1 = S | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = N | last3 = Chen | first3 = A | last4 = Garrett | first4 = L | last5 = Sugiyama | first5 = F | last6 = Takahashi | first6 = S | last7 = Yagami | first7 = K | last8 = Wynshaw-Boris | first8 = A | last9 = Yoshiki | first9 = A. | year = 2003 | title = An expressed pseudogene regulates the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6935 | pages = 91–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature01535 | pmid = 12721631 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080425042454/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | archivedate = 2008-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = TA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A | last3 = Fortin | first3 = PJ | last4 = Nicholls | first4 = RD | year = 2006 | title = The putatively functional Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 12039–12044 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602216103 | pmid = 16882727 | pmc = 1567693 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001043736/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=16337157008352528383|title=Google Scholar|author=|date=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to a [[creator deity]], such as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of "poor design" (as well as the perceived prodigious "wastefulness" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a "poor" designer, or a "blind" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, "If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda%27s-thumb.html |title=The Panda's Peculiar Thumb |work=NATURAL HISTORY |date=November 1978 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063454/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by [[theistic evolutionists]] to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Collins|Collins, Francis S.]] ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]], imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of [[intelligent design]] to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry pick]] which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the [[unfalsifiability]] of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|free will]] that caused the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:16 has [[Yahweh]] saying to [[Eve]] "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy").

'''Basarab Nicolescu''' (born March 25, 1942, [[Ploieşti]], [[Romania]]) is an honorary [[theoretical physicist]] at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), Laboratoire de Physique Nucléaire et de Hautes Énergies, [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]], [[Paris]]. He is also a Professor at the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]], Cluj-Napoca, [[Romania]] and Docteur ès-Sciences Physiques (PhD), 1972, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. He was appointed Professor Extraordinary at Stellenbosch University, South Africa for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2016 and was elected as Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) Fellow in 2011.

He is the president and founder of the [http://basarab.nicolescu.perso.sfr.fr/ciret/ International Center for Transdisciplinary Research and Studies] (CIRET), a non-profit organization (167 members from 30 countries).

In addition, he is the co-founder, with René Berger, of the Study Group on [[Transdisciplinarity]] at [[UNESCO]] (1992) and the founder and Director of the "Transdisciplinarity" Series, Rocher Editions, Monaco and of the "Romanians of Paris", Piktos/Oxus Editions, Paris.

He is also a specialist in the theory of [[elementary particles]]. Basarab Nicolescu is the author of more than one hundred thirty articles in leading international scientific journals{{fact|date=October 2018|reason=The InSpire database lists only 52 published papers, see http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/B.Nicolescu.1}}, has made numerous contributions to science anthologies and participated in several dozens [[France|French]] radio and multimedia documentaries on [[science]].

Basarab Nicolescu is a major advocate of the transdisciplinary reconciliation between science and the humanities. He has published many articles on the role of science in contemporary culture in journals in [[France]], [[Romani people|Romani]]a, [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Japan]] and in the [[United States|USA]].

The Academy of Transdisciplinary Learning and Advanced Studies (ATLAS), Texas, USA decided to institute the "Basarab Nicolescu Transdisciplinary Science &amp; Engineering Award". The first prizes were attributed in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">The '''Bibliographical Society of America''' ('''BSA''') is the oldest [[learned society]] in [[North America]] dedicated to the study of books and manuscripts as physical objects.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibsocamer.org/Society.htm|title=The Bibliographical Society of America |publisher=Bibliographical Society of America |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1904, the society promotes [[Bibliography|bibliographical]] research and issues bibliographical publications. It holds its annual meeting in [[New York City]] in late January, during which time an annual address is presented by a guest speaker followed by three papers from young scholars selected as part of the society's New Scholars Program. It also sponsors lectures, an annual fellowship program, and three prizes for work published in the fields of printing and publishing history.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

In addition, the society publishes the quarterly ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America''.&lt;ref name="PBSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibsocamer.org/Papers/default.htm |title=Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America |publisher=Bibliographical Society of America |accessdate=March 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407000131/http://bibsocamer.org/Papers/default.htm |archivedate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of what was then called ''The Bulletin of the Bibliographical Society of America'' was published in May 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=W.

==History of American Bibliographies==
Charles Evans (1850–1935), supported by myriad people, wrote the first book on the history of printing and books, from Colonial times to the Federal Era, entitled ''American Bibliography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in Bibliographical Civics|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|year=2005|volume=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 50 years after Evans, Ralph Shaw (1902–72) and Richard Shoemaker (1907–70) began to catalogue where Evan left off.
This began a regional catalogue that evolved into a national catalogue called the National Union catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in bibliographical civics|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|date=Summer 2005|volume=40|issue=3|pages=239–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3192">'''Biodrying''' is the process by which [[biodegradable waste]] is rapidly heated through initial stages of [[composting]] to remove moisture from a [[waste stream]] and hence reduce its overall weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi HL, Richard TL, Ahn HK |title=Composting high moisture materials: biodrying poultry manure in a sequentially fed reactor |journal=Compost Sci. and Util. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=303–11 |year=2001 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/CSUContents/2001/Autumn/303.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930122054/http://www.biocycle.net/CSUContents/2001/Autumn/303.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Navaee-Ardeh S, Bertrand F, Stuart PR |title=Emerging biodrying technology for the drying of pulp and paper mixed sludges |journal=Drying Technology |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=863–78 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a748750739?words=biodrying}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugni M, Calcaterra E, Adani F |title=Biostabilization-biodrying of municipal solid waste by inverting air-flow |journal=Bioresour.

Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for [[refuse-derived fuel]]s. 
Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce [[landfill gas]] and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils [[Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme|LATS]] allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial [[mechanical biological treatment]] (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velis CA, Longhurst PJ, Drew GH, Smith R, Pollard SJ |title=Biodrying for mechanical-biological treatment of wastes: a review of process science and engineering |journal=Bioresour.

[[File:The early paintings and drawings of John Constable cover.jpg|thumbnail|A volume from [[Graham Reynolds (art historian)|Graham Reynolds]]'s ''catalogue raisonné'' of [[John Constable]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Graham. ''The Early Paintings and Drawings of John Constable'', (London: [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale University Press]], 1996) {{ISBN|9780300063370}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''''catalogue raisonné''''' is a comprehensive, annotated listing of all the known [[Visual arts|artworks]] by an [[artist]] either in a particular medium or all media.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypl.org/node/29583 What is a Catalogue Raisonné?]", ''New York Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are described in such a way that they may be reliably identified by third parties.

There are many variations, both broader and narrower than "all the works" or "one artist". The parameters may be restricted to one type of art work by one artist or widened to all the works by a group of artists.

It can take many years to complete a ''catalogue raisonné'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' |title=One Art Lover’s Crusade To Catalog The World |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-art-lovers-crusade-to-catalog-the-world/ |first=Oliver |last=Roeder |date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Such a catalog can itself represent the life’s work of the scholar who compiles it. It took Jacob-Baart de la Faille 11 years to complete van Gogh’s catalog. Monet’s catalog was published over a span of 18 years by a French billionaire. And it took 46 years for all of Picasso’s catalog to be released, while its publisher sold his car and apartment to finance the project.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large teams of researchers are sometimes employed on the task. For example, it was reported in 2013 that the Dedalus Foundation (established by the abstract-expressionist painter [[Robert Motherwell]]) took 11 years to complete the three-volume catalogue raisonné of Motherwell’s work which was published by Yale University Press in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Flam, J.; Rogers, K.; and Clifford, T. (2012). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929215632/http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?K=9780300149159 |date=29 September 2014 |title=Robert Motherwell Paintings and Collages: A Catalogue Raisonné 1941–1991}}. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300149159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 25 people contributing to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Boroff and Kazakina (2013).

Early examples consisted of two distinct parts, a biography and the catalogue itself. Their modern counterpart is the critical catalogue which may contain personal views of the author.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt;

==Name==

The term ''catalogue raisonné'' is French, meaning "reasoned catalogue"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalogue+raisonne Catalogue raisonné]", ''Online Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the [[technical terminology]] of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |title=Car-Caz |website=ArtLex.com |date=13 July 2007 |access-date=26 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713171515/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |archive-date=13 July 2007 |quote=Although 'catalogue raisonné' was originally a French term, English speakers have used it for a long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQ, placing the Catalogue Raisonné in context with other types of art catalogues: {{cite web |url=http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909211530/http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-date= 9 September 2017 |title=
What Is a Catalogue? |website=ArtHistory.About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French pluralization "catalogues raisonnés" is used.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;{{efn|As seen in the CRSA homepage, [http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/ catalogueraisonne.org].}}

==Role in authentication of artistic work==
''[[The New York Times]]'' has described catalogues raisonnés as the definitive, scholarly compendia of an artist's work, the "supreme arbiter of the genuine and fake".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (19 June 2012). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/arts/design/art-scholars-fear-lawsuits-in-declaring-works-real-or-fake.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 In Art, Freedom of Expression Doesn't Extend to 'Is It Real?']", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of deceased artists the producer of a catalogue raisonné which is regarded as a standard text may have considerable power to determine whether a particular work is regarded as authentic or not.{{efn|[[Wildenstein Index Number]]}} In this context "producers" may include authors, editors, committees or publishers.

Inclusion in or exclusion from a respected catalogue raisonné can have a considerable effect on the market price of a work, amounting in some cases to large sums of money. Inclusion has been called the difference between "great wealth and the gutter",&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and auction houses sometimes refuse to handle unlisted works.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; As a result, catalogue raisonné authors have been the targets of lawsuits, and allegedly of bribes and even death threats&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (2 February 2014). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/arts/design/a-modigliani-who-says-so.html?ref=design&amp;_r=2 A Modigliani? Who Says So?]", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; although no evidence of the latter has reached the courts.

In an edition of the television programme in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2011, the subject was the authenticity of the [[Claude Monet|Renoir]]  painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]''. The painting was submitted to the [[Wildenstein Institute]] which is the publisher of the catalogues raisonnés&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223132505/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-publications-liste&amp;lang=en |title="Catalogue of Publications", ''Wildenstein Institute'' |date=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most widely accepted as [[Wildenstein Index Number|authoritative]] on the subject of Renoir paintings. The result of this submission was that the Institute, acting in accordance with the wishes of a descendant of the original author of the catalogues, refused to include it in future editions. This decision was taken despite the fact that the Institute had been presented with considerable evidence of the painting's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936:fake-or-fortune?-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713074928/https://theartsdesk.com/?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936%3Afake-or-fortune%3F-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-date=13 July 2018 |title=Reviews |publisher=The Arts Desk |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}{{verify source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this decision the edition of the programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014 investigated one of a [[The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings|group of paintings]] reputedly by French post-impressionist [[Édouard Vuillard]] and on this occasion a committee of the Wildentstein Institute decided that the painting should be included in their catalogue raisonné for the artist.&lt;ref name="Huff vuillard"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Painting Bought For £3,000 On Ebay Actually Worth A Fortune |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/20/ebay-painting-fortune_n_4630252.html |accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art dealer and historian [[Philip Mould]] stated while presenting the programme that this painting would be worth approximately £250,000 if it was accepted for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné, but that if it was not accepted it would be worth approximately £1,500 'as a piece of decorative art' – less than 1% of the full value.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from BBC iPlayer: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03rmbqc ''Fake or Fortune?'' S3 E1/4: "Vuillard"], ''BBC.co.UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the ''New York Times'' reported that some scholars and artists' foundations have decided not to publish future catalogues raisonnés because they fear being sued by buyers or sellers unhappy with their conclusions.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; The question of whether producers of catalogues raisonnés should accept responsibility for determining authenticity of works was debated at a seminar on 29 March 2012 held at Christies, New York under the auspices of the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222195618/http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/programs/programs.html |title="Programs", ''Catalogue Raisonne Scholars Association'' |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of individual policies is given by the Wildenstein Institute's stated policy with regard to authentication of artworks which (at 8 February 2014) was as follows: 'After examination, and based on the opinion of the members of the committee, a recommendation is made in the form of the intention to include or not to include the work under study; a third possibility also exists, that of continuing the examination of the work. Under no circumstance is a recommendation to be considered as a certificate of authenticity or appraisal, and no justification will be provided for said recommendation.’&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |title=Catalogue Raisonné, Critical Catalogue |website=Wildenstein Institute |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223131620/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy contrasts with the text of the letter from the Institute which was read out on the television programme about the Monet painting, in which the Institute appeared to reject the authenticity of the work.

Difficulties can occur when more than one catalogue raisonné is published for the same oeuvre. The work of the artist [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] is the subject of at least five catalogues raisonnés.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gareth (2013). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404042512/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Modigliani-Institute-president-arrested/28490 |title="Modigliani Institute president arrested", ''The Art Newspaper'' |date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of paintings ===

Even if there is no published catalogue raisonné for an artist there may be an organisation which publishes authentications of work which are regarded as having the same effect as a formal catalogue. In the edition of ''Fake or Fortune?'' first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2014, an example of such a committee was featured. The subject of the programme was a painting which bore a signature reading "[[Marc Chagall]]" thus implying that it had been painted by the Russian-French artist of that name. It had been included in a reference work on the painter, but not in the most recent edition of that work, and forensic tests showed that it was painted with pigments not available at the time it was purported to have been executed. Despite this uncertain evidence of authenticity the makers of the programme submitted it to a group referred to as the "Chagall Committee", which includes descendants of the artist. This committee ruled that the painting is a fake and sought its destruction either with the agreement of the owner or, failing that, by court order under the French law of [[Droit moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya (1 February 2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/01/chagall-could-be-furnt-fortune-or-fake The man whose 'real Chagall' could now be burnt as a fake], ''Guardian.com'' (2014/02/01).&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Dr [[Bendor Grosvenor]] criticised the Chagall Committee's decision to seek the destruction of the painting, &lt;ref&gt;(2014). "[http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/2641_Mon_Dieu__le_feu_ctd Mon Dieu - le feu! (ctd.)]", ''Art History News''.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the policy of the Wildenstein Institute when works are submitted to it: 'Whatever the committee's recommendation, the work will be returned upon presentation of the consignment receipt'.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt; Presenter and art dealer [[Philip Mould]] said "I would now [think] three times or more before sending it to Paris. Ugly acts like the one proposed by the Committee can have the effect of damaging the progress of art history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10612704/Philip-Mould-burning-fake-paintings-could-damage-art-history.html |title=Burning fake paintings could damage art history |first=Philip |last=Mould |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2 Feb 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Mississippi's Center for Intelligence and Security Studies''' (or '''CISS'''), located on the [[University of Mississippi]] campus in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], was created in 2008 and is housed in the university's [[University of Mississippi School of Applied Sciences|School of Applied Sciences]].  CISS's primary mission is to deliver academic programming to prepare outstanding students for careers in [[intelligence analysis]] in both the public and private sectors. In addition, CISS personnel engage in applied research and consortium building with government, private and academic partners.

== Recognition as a Center of Academic Excellence ==

In late 2012 The Director of National Intelligence designated the Center for Intelligence and Security Studies at the University of Mississippi as an Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence ("CAE"). CISS is one of only 29 college programs in the United States with this distinction. CAE schools receive funding from the federal government to develop academic courses, fund student travel, and run conferences and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Director of National Intelligence [http://www.dni.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Days of Intrigue Intelligence Exercise == 

The CISS hosts an annual practical intelligence exercise, developed by Melissa Graves and Walter Flaschka. The latest exercise was held on April, 2013, and dealt with a fictional pandemic flu outbreak. ISS student analysts were joined by student scholars visiting from other Center of Academic Excellence schools and organized into one of five agencies, CIA, DIA, FBI, NSA, and State Department. The exercise leads students through a realistic national security or all-hazards disaster scenario similar to what they might face one day as intelligence analysts.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence Center Students Focus on Global Pandemic [http://news.olemiss.edu/intelligence-center-students-focus-on-global-pandemic/#.UbIir2TwIu0]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic Offering ==

The Center offers a minor in Intelligence and Security Studies (ISS) that is designed to complement a major course of study in areas of highly desirable core competencies such as foreign languages, engineering, and international studies. Unlike other minors at the [[University of Mississippi]], students must apply for and be accepted into the minor once they have become students at the university.&lt;ref&gt;University of Mississippi's Center for Intelligence and Security Studies [http://www.olemiss.edu/ciss/About/about.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614014117/http://www.olemiss.edu/ciss/About/about.htm# |date=2010-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criteria for acceptance include an excellent GPA, strong communication skills and exceptional motivation for a career in analytics.

The minor consists of the following six mandatory courses; students generally complete upper level courses in their junior and senior years:&lt;ref&gt;University of Mississippi's Center for Intelligence and Security Studies [http://www.olemiss.edu/ciss/Academics/courses.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605124045/http://www.olemiss.edu/ciss/Academics/courses.htm# |date=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM)''' is a non-profit organization set out to preserve ancient manuscripts of the New Testament. This aim is accomplished by taking high resolution digital photographs of all extant Greek New Testament [[biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]]. The organization was founded by [[Daniel B. Wallace]], a professor at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], in Texas on September 13, 2002, and acts under the umbrella of The Center for the Research of Early Christian Documents (CRECD). Wallace is the executive director of CSNTM. 

Wallace has said the goal of the center is to photograph 1.3 million leaves of Greek New Testament manuscripts, and estimates this goal will not be reached until 2020.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;Fleck, Deborah"[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relnewtestament_08met.ART.Central.Edition1.4688c1c.html Fleck, Deborah, "Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts working to preserve ancient pieces,"] The Dallas Morning News, March 8, 2008. Retrieved April 18, 2008. Additional information from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSNTM team has already photographed manuscripts in [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople at the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church]]; the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in Münster, Germany; [[Tübingen University]], Germany; the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on the island of Patmos, Greece; the National Archive in Tirana, Albania; the [[University of Michigan]]; several colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Glasgow]]; [[Gennadius Library]]; [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], The [[Chester Beatty Library]], various locations throughout Greece, and other sites. The Center and Wallace have also examined manuscripts in Vienna, Cologne, Florence, Berlin, at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai), The [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], the University of Dresden, [[Harvard University]], the British Library, [[Princeton University]], and several other sites.

The activity of CSNTM is limited by several factors, including international law, finances, and the traditional thinking of the other institutions regarding the copying of valuable manuscripts. In spite of these difficulties CSNTM has digital images of:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Washingtonianus]]
* [[Codex Boernerianus]]
* [[Codex Beratinus]]

Although the primary focus of the CSNTM is [[digital preservation]] of New Testament manuscripts, it also works with printed books related to textual criticism such as von Soden's Greek New Testament ("Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte," Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910). CSNTM holds also one manuscript of New Testament, Gregory-Aland minuscule 2882, a 10th- or 11th-century copy of Luke’s Gospel.

The '''Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy''' ('''CCCEP''') is a climate change research centre in [[England]]. It is hosted jointly by the [[University of Leeds]] and the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE).

CCCEP is part of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]], which is chaired by Lord [[Nicholas Stern]] of Brentford, former [[Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]] and author of the widely known [[Stern Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Black, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8571347.stm Copenhagen climate summit undone by 'arrogance'], [[BBC News]], 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

CCCEP was established in 2008, and is funded by the [[ESRC]].{{fact|date=December 2013}}
Its mission is to advance public and private action on climate change through rigorous, innovative research.
In pursuit of its mission, CCCEP has five research themes in its phase 2 programme:{{fact|date=November 2013}}

# ''Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development''
# ''Advancing climate finance and investment''
# ''Evaluating the performance of climate policies''
# ''Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services''
# ''Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation''

In October 2016, The Daily mail reported allegations that CCCEP had fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from UK taxpayers by claiming credit for research they did not produce.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3863462/Exposed-university-helped-secure-9million-money-passing-rivals-research-bankroll-climate-change-agenda.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization responded to the claims saying that the alleged fraud was an overreaction to a clerical error. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccep.ac.uk/news/response-to-article-by-david-rose-in-the-mail-on-sunday/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute''' also referred to as '''Deccan College''' is a post-graduate institute of [[Archeology]], [[Linguistics]] and [[Sanskrit]] &amp; [[Lexicography]] [[Pune]], [[India]].

==History==
===Early years (1821 to 1939)===
Established on 6 October 1821 as Hindoo College, it is one of the oldest institutions of modern learning in India. It was started under [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] (Lt. Governor of [[Bombay Presidency]]), with funds diverted from the erstwhile Peshwa's Dakshina Fund, later disbursed by Sardar Khanderao Dabhade after the Territories of the [[Peshwa]] were annexed in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccancollegepune.ac.in/ Deccan College website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as the Poona Sanskrit College. The first principal was Major [[Thomas Candy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, English and other modern subjects were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;R.N. Dandekar, "Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and the Academic Renaissance in Maharashtra" in ''Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute'', Vol. 69, No. 1/4 (1988), pp. 283-294.&lt;/ref&gt; An English school was added to the college in 1842; on 7 June 1851 the English school was merged with the Hindoo College to form [[Poona College]]. In 1857, the principal was Sir [[Edwin Arnold]], followed by W.A. Russell in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its original location in [[Vishrambaug Wada]] and later in [[Wanwadi]], the Poona College was shifted to its present large campus near Yerwada. The land was donated by the Bombay government. The foundation stone of the main building was laid on 15 October 1864. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian neo-Gothic]] building was constructed by Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] with a munificent 1,00,000 rupees from [[Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, 2nd Baronet]], between [[Kirkee]] and [[Yerwada]].

The college started functioning on the new campus on 23 March 1868. At this stage it was renamed as Deccan College in recognition of the enrollment of students from the entire [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. Until 1881, Deccan College was staffed by four professors, one acting as principal. Another of the four, the professor of Oriental languages, supervised five traditional Sanskrit [[shastri]]s and an expert in Zend [[Pahlevi]] in an extensive program of research and text publication, in addition to his teaching duties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen E. McDonald, "English Education and Social Reform in Late Nineteenth Century Bombay: A Case Study in the Transmission of a Cultural Ideal" in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (May, 1966), pp. 453-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Student enrollment rose to a peak of 210 in 1885. William Wordsworth (grandson of the poet [[William Wordsworth]]) and E.A. Wodehouse (brother of [[P.G. Wodehouse]]) were principals of the college during 1862-74 and 1934-39 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/A-golden-era-of-history-rusts-at-Deccan-college/articleshow/134146.cms | title=A golden era of history rusts at Deccan college | date=17 August 2003 | newspaper=The Times of India | first=Neil | last=Pate | accessdate=24 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history (1939 till present)===
Deccan College temporarily shut down its teaching activities in 1934 due to lack of funding. It was reopened by order of the [[Bombay High Court]] on 17 August 1939 as a post-graduate and research institute for promoting higher learning and research in [[Indology]] and [[Social Sciences]]. The re-opened institute originally had four teaching and research departments: Archaeology, Linguistics, History, and Sociology-Anthropology.

A Transfer Deed was passed by the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 16 August 1939 by which the court enjoined the state government to run the institute in perpetuity. As per the Transfer Deed the Deccan College Poona Trust came into existence in which were vested the properties including the land and buildings. In accordance with the provision in the Transfer Deed, the appointments of the Trustees today are made by the State Government.

It was incorporated by the Poona University (now [[University of Pune]]) in 1948, becoming one of its recognized institutions.

The state government was entrusted with preparing the rules for the administration and management of the Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, which was to cater to studies in post-graduate and research in heritage-related subjects. Thus the Management Council came into existence. In the next half-century the institute, apart from giving instruction to postgraduate students and producing over 500 Ph.D. dissertations, carried out outstanding research in Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Medieval and Maratha History, Sociology-Anthropology and Sanskrit Studies.

In recognition of the excellence achieved by the institute in teaching and research, the H.R.D. Ministry, Government of India, awarded it the status of a Deemed University on 5 March 1990. It started functioning as Deemed University from 1 June 1994. Since then the institute has conducted its own courses for M.A. degree and P.G. diploma in Archaeology, M.A. degree in Linguistics, and M.A. degree in Sanskrit and Lexicography, and has enrolled a large number of students for the Ph.D. degree in these disciplines.

Currently, Deccan College has only two teaching and research departments: Archaeology and Linguistics. On the premises are two museums: the Museum of Maratha History, and the Museum of Archaeology. As of 2016, it is currently involved in the ongoing multi-year excavation of the largest [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site of [[Rakhigarhi]] in [[Hisar district]] of [[Haryana]].

==Extra-academic==
Deccan College had the oldest boat club in India, called the Poonah Boat Club. The site has since been discontinued and is completely overrun by the slums behind Shadal Baba Dargah.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration 'India: The Poonah Boat Club: Bringing Down the Boats' in ''The Graphic'' (6 October 1877), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Developmental Leadership Program''' (DLP, or DLPROG) is an international research and policy initiative. The Program looks at the political processes that underpin development goals such as sustainable economic growth, political stability and inclusive social development.  In particular, DLP explores the central role of leaders, elites and coalitions in developing countries and how they can help or hinder the positive reform of institutions and policies in the public, private and civil society sectors. DLP is funded primarily by [http://aid.dfat.gov.au/makediff/Pages/default.aspx the Australian Aid Program].

==Background==

===The core aims and activities of DLP===
The core aim of DLP is to develop a clearer understanding of the political processes that support developmental change and to embed that understanding in the thinking, policies and practices of the wider development community. DLP does this by:
* Undertaking, commissioning and publishing high quality, policy-relevant research. 
* Organising international seminars and workshop sessions. 
* Providing clear policy guidance, country-level operational guidance and political analysis tools for development practitioners and policy makers.

===Central argument: politics is the key===
* At the core of DLP’s work is the recognition that politics is central to the development process.   
* Development is not just a technical challenge or a question or transferring information, skills or resources. These are important but it is also crucial that development is supported and sustained by local political agents and processes.     
* Politics is understood by DLP in very broad terms, as all of the various activities of conflict, negotiation and co-operation that occur when people with different interests, ideas and degrees of influence have to make collective decisions about rules, resources and power.  
* Politics occurs at all levels and in all sectors and organisations in society. It unfolds through formal rules and institutions but also informal norms, customs and understandings.  Politics is the key to the peaceful management of differences and disagreements, from energy policy in China and India through to the informal networks that promote women’s rights in Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Harrison, T. and Kostka, G. (2012) “Manoeuvres for a Low Carbon State: The Local Politics of Climate Change in China and India”, DLP Research Paper 22; and Tadros, M. (2011) “Working Politically Behind Red Lines: Structure and agency in a comparative study of women’s coalitions in Egypt and Jordan”, DLP Research Paper 12. http://www.dlprog.org/ftp/&lt;/ref&gt;    
* Leadership is central to politics and DLP aims to improve understanding of the role of leaders, elites and coalitions in promoting (or frustrating) inclusive political settlements, stable polities, sustainable economic growth and inclusive social development – particularly in the context of weak and fragile states.

==Organisational structure==
DLP is run by a Program Management Team. While DLP's funding comes primarily from the Australian national government, the Program is independent and autonomous.  	
As of July 2014, DLP's management team consists of:

* ''[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/government-society/marquette-heather.aspx Heather Marquette]'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Director
* ''[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/people/david-hudson David Hudson]'', Department of Political Science, University College London - Deputy Director
* ''[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/about/staff/profile?uname=croche Chris Roche]'', Institute for Human Security and Social Change, La Trobe University, Melbourne - Senior Research Partner

== Overview ==
The Experimental Station marked its 100th anniversary in 2003. It was founded as an effort to move the DuPont Company from [[gunpowder]] and [[explosives]] into the new age of [[chemistry]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The site overlooks the original powder mills upon which the company was founded - now [[Hagley Museum and Library]], a nonprofit educational institution documenting the history of DuPont business and technology. The Experimental Station is east from Hagley Museum and west-southwest from the [[Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]].

As one of the first industrial research laboratories in the United States, the {{convert|150|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus-style Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, serves as the primary research and development facility for DuPont. It is home to DuPont's [[Central Research]] and most other business units of DuPont are also represented on site. The Experimental Station is the birthplace of many of the innovative materials and products developed by DuPont since 1903, including:

* [[Neoprene]] - the world's first [[synthetic rubber]];
* [[Nylon]] polyamide for [[fiber]]s and engineering polymers for machine parts, gears, electrical systems and even [[automobile]] air intake manifolds;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html History of Nylon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621045155/http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html |date=2008-06-21 }} US Patent 2,130,523 'Linear polyamides suitable for spinning into strong pliable fibers', U.S. Patent 2,130,947 'Diamine dicarboxylic acid salt' issued and U.S. Patent 2,130,948 'Synthetic fibers', all issued 20 September 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tyvek]] nonwovens for [[housewrap]], [[envelopes]], medical packaging, environmental protection and [[currency]];
* [[Kevlar]] fiber for [[body armor]] and [[automobile]] [[tire]] reinforcement;&lt;ref&gt;D. Tanner, J. A. Fitzgerald, B. R. Phillips, "The Kevlar Story - an Advanced Materials Case Study," [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] 28(5), 649 - 654 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Magat, "Fibres from Extended Chain Aromatic Polyamides, New Fibres and Their Composites," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A, 294(1411)

* [[Nomex]] fiber for [[firefighting]] equipment and other thermal protection applications.
* Simple [[Crown ethers]] were invented by [[Charles J. Pedersen]] in 1967, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1987.  There is a plaque at the Experimental Station marking the location of the lab where his work took place.
For a more complete description of the inventions of the scientists and engineers of the Experimental Station, see the [[List of DuPont Experimental Station Inventions]].  

Today nearly 2,000 scientists and researchers - including roughly 600 with [[Ph.D.]]s - pursue new opportunities for a broad range of global markets including [[agriculture]] and [[nutrition]], [[electronics]], safety and protection, [[coatings]] and performance materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Science/en_US/rd/station/index.html DuPont.com: Experimental Station&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 50 buildings encompassing 250,000 square meters of research space. This centralized facility allows collaborations to enhance scientific discovery. More recent successes include Suva [[refrigerants]], the BAX [[food safety]] systems and [[Sorona]] [[polyester]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bush at DuPont.jpg|thumb|right|DuPont scientist Armando Byrne discusses potential new directions in biofuels research with President George W. Bush as DuPont's then CEO, Chad Holliday, looks on.]] --&gt;

Research and development now under way includes [[nanotechnology]], emerging [[video display]] technologies, [[fuel cells]], and [[biomaterials]] produced from [[renewable resources]] such as [[maize|corn]]. These developments could lead to foods that help prevent diseases and brittle bones, "smart" materials that can adjust performance on their own, microorganisms that produce [[biodegradable]] products and innovative materials for personal protection.

On the morning of January 24, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] became the first president to visit the Experimental Station.&lt;ref&gt;For more about Bush's visit and his speech on energy, see https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-5.html&lt;/ref&gt; He saw examples of how DuPont is putting science to work to provide products for agricultural [[energy crop]]s, feedstock processing and advanced [[biofuels]] such as [[ethanol]] and bio-[[butanol]]. He also viewed other [[alternative energy]] sources and technologies dealing with [[energy conservation]]. These are all part of DuPont’s sustainable growth mission.

'''Erotic talk''', also known as love talk, dirty talk, gross talk, talking dirty, or talking gross is the practice of using explicit word imagery to heighten sexual excitement before and during (or instead of) physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. It is commonly a part of [[foreplay]], and can include vivid erotic descriptions, [[Off-color humor|sexual humor]], sexual commands and [[Profanity|rude words]]. It may be whispered into a partner's ear, spoken over a telephone, or put into text.

When lovers are apart from one another and [[physical intimacy]] is impossible, it can be an important aspect of [[virtual sex]], particularly [[phone sex]] and [[cybersex]]. Additionally, dirty talk is more sexual in nature than [[pillow talk]] and tends to precede rather than follow lovemaking.

The [[Marquis de Sade]], who fancied himself an expert on matters sexual, states in the introduction to ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' that "among [[libertines]], it is commonly accepted that the most [[voluptuous]] sensations are transmitted by the organs of [[hearing]]" -- that is, that dirty talk is the most arousing form of sex.  One fictional character in [[Pornographic film|porn films]] that became associated with the idea of men using sexual dirty talk with women was actor [[John Leslie (pornographic actor)|John Leslie]]'s character of 'Jack' in ''[[Talk Dirty to Me (film)|Talk Dirty to Me]]'' (1980).

'''Expectancy theory''' (or '''expectancy theory of motivation''') proposes an individual will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behavior over other behaviors due to what they expect the result of that selected [[behavior]] will be.&lt;ref name="Oliver, R. 1974"&gt;Oliver, R. (August, 1974). Expectancy is the probability that the individual assigns to work effort being followed by a given level of achieved task performance. Expectancy Theory Predictions of Salesmen's Performance. Journal of Marketing Research 11, 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the motivation of the behavior selection is determined by the desirability of the outcome. However, at the core of the theory is the [[cognitive]] process of how an individual processes the different motivational elements. This is done before making the ultimate choice. The outcome is not the sole determining factor in making the decision of how to behave.&lt;ref name="Oliver, R. 1974"/&gt;

Expectancy theory is about the mental processes regarding choice, or choosing. It explains the processes that an individual undergoes to make choices. In the study of [[organizational behavior]], expectancy theory is a [[motivation]] theory first proposed by [[Victor Vroom]] of the [[Yale School of Management]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This theory emphasizes the needs for organizations to relate rewards directly to performance and to ensure that the rewards provided are those rewards deserved and wanted by the recipients."&lt;ref&gt;Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, Bruce H, Management – 4th edition; (2008) – Barron's Educational Series, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7641-3931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor H. Vroom (1964) defines [[motivation]] as a process governing choices among alternative forms of voluntary activities, a process controlled by the individual. The individual makes choices based on estimates of how well the expected results of a given behavior are going to match up with or eventually lead to the desired results. Motivation is a product of the individual's expectancy that a certain effort will lead to the intended performance, the instrumentality of this performance to achieving a certain result, and the desirability of this result for the individual, known as ''valence''.&lt;ref&gt;(S.E. Condrey, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;482)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
In 1964, Victor H. Vroom developed the expectancy theory through his study of the motivations behind decision making. This theory is relevant to the study of [[management]].

==Key elements==
The expectancy theory of motivation explains the behavioral process of why individuals choose one behavioral option over the other. This theory explains that individuals can be motivated towards goals if they believe that there is a positive correlation between efforts and performance, the outcome of a favorable performance will result in a desirable reward, a reward from a performance will satisfy an important need, and/or the outcome satisfies their need enough to make the effort worthwhile.
Vroom introduced three variables within the expectancy theory which are [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] (V), expectancy (E) and instrumentality (I). The three elements are important behind choosing one element over another because they are clearly defined: effort-performance expectancy (E&gt;P expectancy), performance-outcome expectancy (P&gt;O expectancy).&lt;ref&gt;P. Subba Rao, Personnel and Human Resource Management – Text and cases; (2000) – Himalaya Publishing House {{ISBN|81-7493-777-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectancy theory has three components: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence.

# Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)
# Instrumentality: performance → outcome (P→O)
# Valence: V(R) outcome → reward

===Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)===
Expectancy is the belief that one's effort (E) will result in attainment of desired performance (P) goals. Usually based on an individual's past experience, self-confidence (self efficacy), and the perceived difficulty of the performance standard or goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chiang |first1=Chun-Fang |last2=Jang |first2=SooCheong (Shawn) |date=June 2008 |title=An expectancy theory model for hotel employee motivation |journal=Journal of Hospitality Management |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=313–322 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2007.07.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Self efficacy – the person's belief about their ability to successfully perform a particular behavior. The individual will assess whether they have the required skills or knowledge desired to achieve their goals.
# Goal difficulty – when goals are set too high or performance expectations that are made too difficult. This will most likely lead to low expectancy. This occurs when the individual believes that their desired results are unattainable.
# Perceived control – Individuals must believe that they have some degree of control over the expected outcome. When individuals perceive that the outcome is beyond their ability to influence, expectancy, and thus motivation, is low.

===Instrumentality: Performance → Outcome (P→O)===
Instrumentality is the belief that a person will receive a reward if the performance expectation is met. This reward may present itself in the form of a pay increase, promotion, recognition or sense of accomplishment. Instrumentality is low when the reward is the same for all performances given.

Another way that instrumental outcomes work is commissions. With commissions performance is directly correlated with outcome (how much money is made). If performance is high and many goods are sold the more money the person will make.

Factors associated with the individual's instrumentality for outcomes are trust, control and policies:
* Trusting the people who will decide who gets what outcome, based on the performance,
* Control of how the decision is made, of who gets what outcome,
* Policies understanding of the correlation between performance and outcomes.

===Valence V(R)===
Valence:&lt;ref name="scholar.lib.vt.edu"&gt;Maslow—Move Aside! A Heuristical Motivation Model for Leaders in Career and Technical Education Pg. 10 – 11 http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v44n2/pdf/kroth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the value an individual places on the rewards of an outcome, which is based on their needs, goals, values and sources of motivation. Influential factors include one's values, needs, goals, preferences and sources that strengthen their motivation for a particular outcome.

Valence is characterized by the extent to which a person values a given outcome or reward. This is not an actual level of satisfaction rather the expected satisfaction of a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Brian|title=Expectancy Theory|url=https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/PSYCH484/4.+Expectancy+Theory|publisher=Shaun Miller|accessdate=12/04/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valence refers to the value the individual personally places on the rewards. -1 →0→ +1

'''-1= avoiding the outcome 0 = indifferent to the outcome +1 = welcomes the outcome'''

In order for the valence to be positive, the person must prefer attaining the outcome to not attaining it.

 Valence is one behavioral alternative, where the decision is measured on the value of the reward. The model below shows the direction of motivation, when behavior is energized:

'''Motivational Force (MF) = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence'''

When deciding among behavioral options, individuals select the option with the greatest amount of motivational force (MF). 
[[Expectancy]] and [[Instrumental and value rationality|instrumentality]] are attitudes (cognitions), whereas valence is rooted in an individual's value system.
 
Examples of valued outcomes in the workplace include, pay increases and bonuses, promotions, time off, new assignments, recognition, etc. If management can effectively determine what their employee values, this will allow the manager to motivate employees in order to get the highest result and effectiveness out of the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|title=Motivation: Expectancy Theory|url=http://www.uri.edu/research/lrc/scholl/webnotes/Motivation_Expectancy.htm|publisher=Richard Scholl|accessdate=12/04/2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009113406/http://www.uri.edu/research/lrc/scholl/webnotes/Motivation_Expectancy.htm|archive-date=2014-10-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
===Management===
Victor Vroom's expectancy theory is one such [[management theory]] focused on motivation. According to Holdford and Lovelace-Elmore (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;8), Vroom asserts, "intensity of work effort depends on the perception that an individual's effort will result in a desired outcome".

In order to enhance the performance-outcome tie, managers should use systems that tie rewards very closely to performance. Managers also need to ensure that the rewards provided are deserved and wanted by the recipients.&lt;ref name="Montana, Patrick J 2008"&gt;Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, Bruce H, Management - 4th edition; (2008) - Barron's Educational Series, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7641-3931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve the effort-performance tie, managers should engage in training to improve their capabilities and improve their belief that added effort will in fact lead to better performance.&lt;ref name="Montana, Patrick J 2008"/&gt;

- Emphasizes [[self-interest]] in the alignment of rewards with employee's wants.

- Emphasizes the connections among expected behaviors, rewards and organizational goals

Expectancy Theory, though well known in work motivation literature, is not as familiar to scholars or practitioners outside that field.

===Computer users===

Lori Baker-Eveleth and Robert Stone, [[University of Idaho]] in 2008 conducted an [[empirical]] study on 154 faculty members' reactions to the use of new software.&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Eveleth L., Stone,R.W.(2008) Expectancy theory and behavioral intentions to use computer applications - Interdisciplinary Journal of Information&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that ease of system use affects both [[self-efficacy]] (self-confidence) and anticipated usefulness. These in turn influenced the decision, or anticipated decision, to use the software. 

Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy impact a person's affect and behavior separately: 

- Self-efficacy is the belief that a person possesses the skills and abilities to successfully accomplish something.

- Outcome expectancy is the belief that when a person accomplishes the task, a desired outcome is attained. 

Self-efficacy has a direct impact on outcome expectancy and has a larger effect than outcome expectancy. Employees will accept [[technology]] if they believe the technology is a benefit to them. If an employee is mandated to use the technology, the employees will use it but may feel it is not useful. On the other hand, when an employee is not mandated, the employee may be influenced by these other factors (self-confidene and confidence in outcome) that it should be used.

The self-efficacy theory can be applied to predicting and perceiving an employee's belief for computer use (Bandura, 1986; Bates &amp; Khasawneh, 2007). This theory associates an individual's cognitive state with effective behavioral outcomes (Staples, Hulland, &amp; Higgins, 1998).

Other constructs of the self-efficacy theory that impact attitudes and intentions to perform are:

- past experience or mastery with the task; 

- vicarious experience performing the task; 

- emotional or physiological arousal regarding the task; 

- and social persuasion to perform the task.

===Models of teacher expectancy effects===
[[Jere Brophy]] and Thomas Good&lt;ref&gt;Jere Brophy, Thomas Good (1974) Teacher-Student Relationships: Causes and Consequences New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jere Brophy, Thomas Good (1987)Looking in classrooms (4th ed.), New York, Harper and Row&lt;/ref&gt; provided a comprehensive model of how teacher expectations could influence children's achievement. Their model posits that teachers' expectations indirectly affect children's achievement: "teacher expectations could also affect student outcomes indirectly by leading to differential teacher treatment of students that would condition student attitudes, expectations, and behavior" (Brophy, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;639). The model includes the following sequence. Teachers form differential expectations for students early in the school year. Based on these expectations, they behave differently toward different students, and as a result of these behaviors the students begin to understand what the teacher expects from them. If students accept the teachers' expectations and behavior toward them then they will be more likely to act in ways that confirm the teacher's initial expectations. This process will ultimately affect student achievement so that teachers' initial expectancies are confirmed.&lt;ref name="Schunk, Dale H. 2012. pp. 96-97"&gt;Schunk, Dale H.; Meece, Judith L.. Student Perceptions in the Classroom. Mahwah: Routledge, 2012. Ebook Library. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing work related to this model, Brophy (1983) made several important observations about teacher expectation effects. First and foremost, he argued that most of the beliefs teachers hold about student are accurate, and so their expectations usually reflect students' actual performance levels. As a result, Brophy contended that self-fulfilling prophecy effects have relatively weak effects on student achievement, changing achievement 5% to 10%, although he did note that such effects usually are negative expectation effects rather than positive effects. Second, he pointed out that various situational and individual difference factors influence the extent to which teacher expectations will act as self-fulfilling prophecies. For instance, Brophy stated that expectancy effects may be larger in the early elementary grades, because teachers have more one-on-one interactions with students then, as they attempt to socialize children into the student role. In the upper elementary grades more whole-class teaching methods are used, which may minimize expectation effects. Some evidence supports this claim; expectancy effects in Rosenthal and Jacobson's (1968) study were strongest during the earlier grades. Raudenbush's (1984) meta-analysis of findings from different teacher expectancy studies in which expectancies were induced by giving teachers artificial information about children's intelligence showed that expectancy effects were stronger in Grades 1 and 2 than in Grades 3 through Grade 6, especially when the information was given to teachers during the first few weeks of school. These findings are particularly relevant because they show a form of the expectancy theory: how teachers have certain expectations of students, and how they treat the students differently because of those expectations.&lt;ref name="Schunk, Dale H. 2012. pp. 96-97"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics of the expectancy model include Graen (1969), Lawler (1971), Lawler and Porter (1967), and Porter and Lawler (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0030-5073(73)90066-4 |title=Expectancy theory and job behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=482 |year=1973 |last1=Lawler |first1=Edward E |last2=Suttle |first2=J.Lloyd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their criticisms of the theory were based upon the expectancy model being too simplistic in nature; these critics started making adjustments to Vroom's model.

Edward Lawler claims that the simplicity of expectancy theory is deceptive because it assumes that if an employer makes a reward, such as a financial bonus or promotion, enticing enough, employees will increase their productivity to obtain the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/T922205.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610224740/http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/T922205.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this only works if the employees believe the reward is beneficial to their immediate needs. For example, a $2 increase in salary may not be desirable to an employee if the increase pushes her into a tax bracket in which she believes her net pay is actually reduced, which is actually impossible in the United States with marginal tax brackets. Similarly, a promotion that provides higher status but requires longer hours may be a deterrent to an employee who values evening and weekend time with their children.

In addition to that, if anyone in the armed forces or security agencies is promoted, there is a must condition for such promotions, that he/she will be transferred to other locations. In such cases, if the new place is far from their permanent residence, where their family is residing, they will not be motivated by such promotions, and the results will be other way round. Because, the outcome, which this reward (promotion) will yield, may not be valued by those who are receiving it.

Lawler's new proposal for expectancy theory is not against Vroom's theory. Lawler argues that since there have been a variety of developments of expectancy theory since its creation in 1964; the expectancy model needs to be updated. Lawler's new model is based on four claims.&lt;ref name="web.dcp.ufl.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.dcp.ufl.edu/hinze/Expectancy.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027133712/http://web.dcp.ufl.edu/hinze/Expectancy.htm |archive-date=2010-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, whenever there are a number of outcomes, individuals will usually have a preference among those outcomes. Two, there is a belief on the part of that individual that their action(s) will achieve the outcome they desire. Three, any desired outcome was generated by the individual's behavior. Finally, the actions generated by the individual were generated by the preferred outcome and expectation of the individual.

Instead of just looking at expectancy and instrumentality, W.F. Maloney and J.M. McFillen&lt;ref name="web.dcp.ufl.edu"/&gt; found that expectancy theory could explain the motivation of those individuals who were employed by the construction industry. For instance, they used worker expectancy and worker instrumentality. Worker expectancy is when supervisors create an equal match between the worker and their job. Worker instrumentality is when an employee knows that any increase in their performance leads to achieving their goal.

In the chapter entitled "On the Origins of Expectancy Theory" published in ''Great Minds in Management'' by Ken G. Smith and Michael A. Hitt, Vroom himself agreed with some of these criticisms and stated that he felt that the theory should be expanded to include research conducted since the original publication of his book.

'''Functional assessment''' is an ongoing process collecting information to understand the reason under a problem or target behavior. The function of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or [[Therapy|treatments]] used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional assessments we have learned that there are complex [[patterns]] to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that [[evokes]] the behavior. More work needs to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and [[efficiency]], being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention.&lt;ref name= "JABA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Robert H|title=Functional Assessment: Contributions and Future Directions|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|issue=2|pages=401–404|pmc=1297816|pmid=16795831|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Functional assessment is a method developed by [[applied behavior analysis]] to identify the [[variable (research)|variable]]s that maintain a [[problem]] [[behavior]]. Behavior is [[lawful]]. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[Operant conditioning|consequences]] that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the [[time]] and place, the presence of others and the [[frequency]]. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be [[reinforcing]] for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Sandra L|title=Functional Assessment|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=April 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=233|doi=10.1023/a:1022968200344}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 July 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MMPP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miltenberger|first=Raymond G|title=Behavior Modification Principles &amp; Procedures|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=United States|isbn=978-1-111-30611-3|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of problem behavior==
The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior.&lt;ref name= "Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siebert|first=Carol|title=Functional Assessment: Process and Product|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=December 2006|volume=19|issue=1|pages=51–57|url=http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=functional+assessment&amp;facet[0]=addFacetValueFilters(ContentType,Journal+Article)|accessdate=5 August 2012|doi=10.1177/1084822306292516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social positive reinforcement===
Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[positive reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of [[attention]], fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother ([[social]]) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Social negative reinforcement===
Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[negative reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic positive reinforcement===
Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs [[Automation|automatically]] and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an [[autistic]] child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the [[sensory perception|sensory]] stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic negative reinforcement===
Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be [[binge eating]]. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Assessment methods==
There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories.&lt;ref name= "Furniss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furniss|first=Frederick|title=Assessment Methods|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2009|volume=10|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0088-3_3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect methods===
Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barribeau|first=Paul|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of the Survey Method|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/research/survey/com2d1.cfm|work=Survey Research. Writing@CSU.|publisher=Colorado State University Department of English.|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective  as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior.

Indirect methods can help develop a [[correlation]] [[hypothesis]] but not a [[functional relationship]].

===Direct observation methods===
Direct observation methods involve is present to [[observe]] and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a [[natural environment]]. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.&lt;ref name= "Furniss" /&gt;

The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively.

Direct observation can also be can ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Experimental methods===
Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Gregory P|author2=Brian A Iwata |author3=Brandon E McCord |title=Functional analysis of problem behavior: a review.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=Summer 2003|volume=36|issue=2|pages=146–185|pmc=1284431|pmid=12858983|doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=RH|author2=EG Carr |author3=J Halle |author4=G McGee |author5=S Odom |title=The use of single-subject research to identify evidence-based practice in special education|journal=Exceptional children|year=2005|volume=71|issue=2|pages=165|url=http://www.freewebs.com/lowvisionstuff/Single_Subject.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1177/001440290507100203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis.

==Conducting a functional assessment==
A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment.&lt;ref name= "JABA" /&gt;

# The first step should start with a '''behavioral interview''' with the client or someone who knows him/her well.
# The interview from the first step should help '''develop a hypothesis''' about which antecedent would produce the behavior and which reinforcing consequence would maintain it.
# Once a hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to '''conduct a direct observation assessment''' in the natural environment. If the data collected from the interview is [[consistent]] with the observation, the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the hypothesis is strengthened.
# With the information from both sources being consistent, '''confirm your initial hypothesis''' to develop appropriate treatment plans for the identified antecedent and consequence.
# If the data collected from the behavioral interview and the information observed from the direct observation is inconsistent, '''conduct further assessments''' such as another interview or continued observation to clear up any of the inconsistencies.
# If after review and extra interviews and further observations, the information collected are still inconsistent, it is time to '''conduct a functional analysis'''. A functional analysis is also need if the information is consistent but can not lead to a conclusive, firm hypothesis about the [[predictably]] of the antecedent and consequence.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Functional interventions==
After a function assessment has been conducted with success, the information collected is used to develop appropriate treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence for more desirable behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Siebert" /&gt;

Functional interventions include [[extinction]], [[differential reinforcement]] and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also nonaversive as punishment is not involved.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

More aversive interventions can be used as  latter resort if previous nonaversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as [[time-out (parenting)|time-out]] and response cost are considered [[negative punishment]], which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than [[positive punishment]] such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and [[physical restraint]]. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered.

==Research==
A lot of [[research]] being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of [[mentally challenged]] children or adults and [[autistic]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matson|first=Johnny L.|author2=Megan Sipes |author3=Max Horovitz |author4=Julie A. Worley |author5=Mary E. Shoemaker |author6=Alison M. Kozlowski |title=Behaviors and corresponding functions addressed via functional assessment|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|date=January 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=625–629|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142221000301X|accessdate=5 August 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with [[intellectual disabilities]] exhibiting [[aggressive]] behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands.

Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with [[developmental disabilities]] showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintaining their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or [[Sensory system|sensory]] stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iwata|first=Brian A|author2=Michael F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7745">'''Geography of aging''' or '''gerontological geography''' is an emerging field of knowledge of [[Human Geography]] that analyzes the socio-spatial implications of [[aging]] of the [[population]] from the understanding of the relationships between the [[Social environment|physical-social environment]] and the [[elderly]], at different scales, micro (City, region, country), etc.

Since the 1970s in a number of developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]], there have been increasing studies focusing on the understanding of spatial patterns of [[aging population]], as well as aspects related to residential changes and provision of health and social services. Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing.

The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of [[gerontology]] in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fernández-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-Pérez and Vicente Rodríguez-Rodríguez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol (Spain).

In [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]], Diego Sánchez-González has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and [[social environment]] and the [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]; the importance of the [[natural environment]] (therapeutic [[natural landscape]]) on active and [[healthy aging]] in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio-environmental [[vulnerability]] of the elderly in the face of [[climate change]]; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and [[public space]]); elderly people with [[disabilities]] and [[social exclusion]]; [[leisure]] and [[tourism]] of elderly; and the [[planning]] of gerontological and geriatric services.

{{Science}}



==A==
*'''[[Height above ground level|Above ground level]]''' — In [[aviation]], [[atmospheric sciences]] and [[broadcasting]], a '''height above ground level''' ('''AGL'''&lt;ref name="CAP413"&gt;{{cite book | date=28 May 2015 | title=Radiotelephony Manual |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority| id=CAP413| isbn=9780 11792 893 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[height#In aviation|height]] measured with respect to the underlying [[earth's surface|ground surface]]. This is as opposed to altitude/elevation [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL), or (in [[broadcast engineering]]) [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT). In other words, these expressions (AGL, AMSL, HAAT) indicate where the "zero level" or "reference altitude" is located.
*'''[[Absolute humidity]]''' — describes the water content of air and is expressed in either grams per cubic meter&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, S.S., "A treatise on producer-gas and gas-producers", (1906) The Engineering and Mining Journal, London, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; or grams per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, (2007) ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (8th Edition),  Section 12, Psychrometry, Evaporative Cooling and Solids Drying [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|978-0-07-151135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*'''[[Absolute value]]''' — In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[non-negative]] value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = −''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|−''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.
*'''[[Acceleration]]''' —  In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
*'''[[Acquisition of signal]]''' —  A '''pass''', in [[spaceflight]] and [[satellite communications]], is the period in which a [[satellite]] or other [[spacecraft]] is above the [[Horizontal coordinate system|local horizon]] and available for [[radio]] communication with a particular [[ground station]], [[satellite receiver]], or relay satellite (or, in some cases, for visual sighting). The beginning of a pass is termed ''acquisition of signal''; the end of a pass is termed ''loss of signal''.&lt;ref name=NLSA&gt;{{cite web|title=AOS, TCA, and LOS|url=http://www.nlsa.com/definitions/aos_defined.html|publisher=Northern Lights Software Associates|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the ''time of closest approach''.&lt;ref name=NLSA/&gt;
*'''[[Action (physics)|Action]]''' — In [[physics]], '''action''' is an attribute of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of a [[physical system]] from which the [[equations of motion]] of the system can be derived. It is a [[functional (mathematics)|mathematical functional]] which takes the [[trajectory]], also called ''path'' or ''history'', of the system as its argument and has a [[real number]] as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.&lt;ref name="mcgraw1"&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [[energy|[energy]]]⋅[[time|[time]]] or [[momentum|[momentum]]]⋅[[length|[length]]], and its [[SI unit]] is [[joule]]-second.
*'''[[Automatic direction finder|ADF]]''' —Automatic direction finder
*'''[[Advanced Space Vision System]]''' — The '''Advanced Space Vision System''' (also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS) is a  [[computer vision]] system designed primarily for [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly.&lt;ref name="nrcc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|title=Space Vision System Helps Astronauts See in Space|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|year=2008|author=NRCC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603143525/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|archivedate=June 3, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses regular 2D cameras in the [[Space Shuttle]] bay, on the [[Canadarm]], or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.&lt;ref name="nrcc"/&gt;
*'''[[Aeroacoustics]]''' — Is a branch of [[acoustics]] that studies noise generation via either [[turbulent]] fluid motion or [[aerodynamic]] forces interacting with surfaces. Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows.  A notable example of this phenomenon is the [[Aeolian sound|Aeolian tones]] produced by wind blowing over fixed objects.
*'''[[Aerobraking]]''' — is a [[spaceflight]] maneuver that reduces the high point of an [[elliptical orbit]] ([[apoapsis]]) by flying the vehicle through the [[atmosphere]] at the low point of the [[orbit]] ([[periapsis]]). The resulting [[Drag (physics)|drag]] slows the [[spacecraft]]. Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a [[rocket engine]].
*'''[[Aerocapture]]''' —  is an [[Orbital maneuver|orbital transfer maneuver]] used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' — is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. 
*'''[[Aeroelasticity]]''' — is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]]. The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.
*'''[[Aeronautics]]''' — Is the science or art involved with the study, [[design process|design]], and manufacturing of air [[flight]] capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the [[atmosphere]].
*'''[[Aerospace architecture]]''' — is broadly defined to encompass [[architecture|architectural]] design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems; [[space vehicle]]s, [[space station]]s, habitats and lunar and [[planetary surface construction]] bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems.
*'''[[Aerospace bearing]]''' — '''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.
*'''[[Aerospace engineering]]''' — is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.
*'''[[Aerospace materials]]''' — are materials, frequently [[alloy|metal alloy]]s, that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for [[aerospace]] purposes. These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].
*'''[[Aerospike engine]]''' — is a type of [[rocket engine]] that maintains its [[aerodynamic]] efficiency across a wide range of [[altitude]]s. It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25–30% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for [[thrust]].
*'''[[Aerostat]]''' — is a [[lighter than air]] aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and powered [[airship]]s.
*'''[[Aerostructure]]''' — is a component of an [[aircraft]]'s airframe. This may include all or part of the [[fuselage]], [[wing]]s, or flight control surfaces.
*'''[[Aft-crossing trajectory]]''' — is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rocket's rotation (induced by the deployment from the aircraft) is slowed by a small [[parachute]] attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it.  It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. 
*'''[[Above ground level|AGL]]''' — Above ground level
*'''[[Aileron]]''' — is a hinged [[flight control surface]] usually forming part of the [[trailing edge]] of each [[wing]] of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in [[Flight dynamics|roll]] (or movement around the aircraft's [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|longitudinal axis]]), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the [[Lift (force)|lift vector]].  Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.
*'''[[Air-augmented rocket]]''' —
*'''[[Aircraft]]''' — is a [[machine]] that is able to [[flight|fly]] by gaining support from the [[air]].&lt;!--English word "aircraft" is singular and plural with no "s". See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt; It counters the force of gravity by using either [[Buoyancy|static lift]] or by using the [[Lift (force)|dynamic lift]] of an [[airfoil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft|title=Aircraft - Define Aircraft at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328141634/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft|archivedate=28 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in a few cases the [[Powered lift|downward thrust]] from [[jet engine]]s.  Common examples of aircraft include [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[airship]]s (including [[blimp]]s), [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]]s, and [[hot air balloon]]s.&lt;ref name="wingsoverkansas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Kinds &amp; Types of Aircraft|url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/features/a1037/|website=www.wingsoverkansas.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121165354/http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/features/a1037/|archivedate=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*'''[[Aircraft flight control systems]]''' — A conventional [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.
*'''[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]''' —
*'''[[Airfoil]]''' — An '''airfoil''' ([[American English]]) or '''aerofoil''' ([[British English]]) is the cross-sectional shape of a [[wing]], blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]).
*'''[[Airlock]]''' — is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a [[pressure vessel]] and its surroundings while minimizing the change of [[pressure]] in the vessel and loss of [[air]] from it.  The lock consists of a small chamber with two [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] [[door]]s in series which do not open simultaneously.
*'''[[Airship]]''' — An '''airship''' or '''dirigible balloon''' is a type of [[aerostat]] or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airship|title=Definition of AIRSHIP|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a [[lifting gas]] that is less dense than the surrounding air.
*'''[[Albedo]]''' — is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).
*'''[[Anemometer]]''' — is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]], and is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]].
*'''[[Angle of attack]]''' —  In [[fluid dynamics]], '''angle of attack''' ('''AOA''', or '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''') is the [[angle]] between a [[Airfoil#Airfoil terminology|reference line]] on a body (often the [[chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of an [[airfoil]]) and the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/incline.html|title=NASA aeronautics guided tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. 
*'''[[Angular momentum]]''' — In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].
*'''[[Angular velocity]]''' — In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.
*'''[[Anticyclone]]''' — An '''anticyclone''' (that is, opposite to a [[cyclone]]) is a [[weather]] [[meteorological phenomenon|phenomenon]] defined by the United States [[National Weather Service]]'s glossary as "a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Glossary: Anticyclone|date=|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140523/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Antimatter rocket]]''' — is a proposed class of [[rocket]]s that use [[antimatter]] as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the [[rest mass]] of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher [[energy density]] and [[specific impulse]] than any other proposed class of rocket.
*'''[[Apsis]]''' — is an extreme point in the [[orbit]] of an [[physical body|object]]. The word comes via Latin from Greek and is [[cognate]] with ''[[apse]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apsis|title=the definition of apsis|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[elliptic orbit]]s about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes ''peri-'' ({{ety||''περί'' (peri)|near}}) and ''ap-''/''apo-'' ({{ety||''ἀπ(ό)'' (ap(ó))|away from}}) added to a reference to the [[primary (astronomy)|body being orbited]].
*'''[[Arcjet rocket]]''' — or '''arcjet thruster''' is a form of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], in which an electrical discharge (arc) is created in a flow of propellant&lt;ref&gt;John, R. R., Bennett, S., and Connors, J. P., "Arcjet Engine Performance: Experiment and Theory," ''AIAA Journal, Vol. 1,'' No. 11, Nov. 1963. [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/3.2103 http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/3.2103]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallner, Lewis E. and Czika, Joseph, Jr, ''[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA392837 ARC-Jet Thrustor for Space Propulsion,]'' NASA Technical note TN D-2868, NASA Lewis Research Center, June 1965 (accessed September 8 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically [[hydrazine]] or [[ammonia]]).  This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost.  Also, the [[thrust]] levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines.
*'''[[Areal velocity]]''' — In [[classical mechanics]], '''areal velocity''' (also called '''sector velocity''' or '''sectorial velocity''') is the rate at which [[area]] is swept out by a particle as it moves along a [[curve]].

*'''[[ARP4761]]''' —
*'''[[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|Automatic direction finder]]''' —
*'''[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)]]''' — In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

*'''[[Beam-powered propulsion]]''' — also known as directed energy propulsion, is a class of [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft propulsion]] that uses energy beamed to the spacecraft from a remote power plant to provide energy. The beam is typically either a [[microwave]] or a [[laser]] beam and it is either pulsed or continuous.  A continuous beam lends itself to [[thermal rocket]]s, [[Photonic laser thruster|photonic thrusters]] and [[light sail]]s, whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and [[pulse detonation engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Breakthrough|title=Progress in beamed energy propulsion {{!}} Kevin Parkin|date=2018-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnvHNoYuTpI|accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Buoyancy]]''' — In [[physics]], '''buoyancy''' or '''upthrust''', is an upward [[force]] exerted by a [[fluid]] that opposes the [[weight]] of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by [[Archimedes' principle]]) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the [[Displacement (fluid)|displaced]] fluid.

*'''[[Cabin pressurization]]''' — is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

[[File: HSBC Hong Kong Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|The [[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC Hong Kong headquarters]], completed in 1985, is one example of high-tech architecture.]] 
'''High-tech architecture''', also known as '''Structural Expressionism''', is a type of '''Late Modern''' [[architectural style]] that emerged in the 1970s, incorporating elements of high-tech industry and technology into building design. High-tech architecture appeared as revamped [[Modern architecture|modernism]], an extension of those previous ideas helped by even more technological advances. This category serves as a bridge between modernism and [[Postmodern architecture|post-modernism]]; however, there remain gray areas as to where one category ends and the other begins. In the 1980s, high-tech architecture became more difficult to distinguish from post-modern architecture.  Some of its themes and ideas were later absorbed into the style of [[Neo-Futurism]] art and architectural movement.

Like [[Brutalism]], Structural Expressionist buildings reveal their structure on the outside as well as the inside, but with visual emphasis placed on the internal steel and/or concrete skeletal structure as opposed to exterior concrete walls.  In buildings such as the [[Pompidou Centre]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}, this idea of revealed structure is taken to the extreme, with apparently structural components serving little or no structural role. In this case, the use of "structural" steel is a stylistic or aesthetic matter.

The style's premier practitioners include [[Colombian Americans|Colombo-American]] architect [[Bruce Graham]] and [[Bangladeshi Americans|Bangladeshi-American]] architect [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] for the [[John Hancock Centre]], [[Willis Tower]] and [[Onterie Center]], [[United Kingdom|British]] architects [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman, Lord Foster]], [[Richard Rogers|Richard, Lord Rogers]], Sir [[Michael Hopkins (architect)|Michael Hopkins]], [[Italy|Italian]] architect [[Renzo Piano]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], known for his organic, skeleton-like designs. Early high-tech buildings were referred to by historian [[Reyner Banham]] as "serviced sheds" due to their exposure of mechanical services in addition to the structure. Most of these early examples used exposed structural steel as their material of choice. As hollow structural sections had only become widely available in the early 1970s, high-tech architecture saw much experimentation with this material.

==Background==

[[File:860-880 Lake Shore Drive.jpg|thumb|upright|[[860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]], completed 1951, Chicago]]
[[File:John Hancock Center 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[John Hancock Center]], completed 1969, Chicago]]
[[File:Lloyd's 14.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lloyd's building]], completed 1986, London]]
Buildings in this architectural style were constructed mainly in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. It is deeply connected with what is called the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Second School of Chicago]] which emerged after [[World War II]]. The main content is that the technological kind of construction, mostly with steel and glass, is expressed in a formal independent way to gain [[aesthetic]] qualities from it. The first proper example are the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] by [[Germany|German]] architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}

==Name==

The style got its name from the book ''High Tech: The [[Industrial Style]] and Source Book for The Home'', written by design journalists Joan Kron  and Suzanne Slesin and published in November 1978 by Clarkson N. Potter, New York.  The book, illustrated with hundreds of photos, showed how designers, architects, and  homeowners were appropriating classic industrial objects—library shelving, chemical glass, metal deck plate, restaurant supply, factory and airport runway light fixtures, movers' quilts, industrial carpeting etc.—found in industrial catalogues and putting these to use in residential settings. The foreword to the book by architect [[Emilio Ambasz]], former curator of design at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], put the trend in historical context.

As a result of the publicity and popularity of the book, the decorating style became known as "High-Tech", and accelerated the entry of the still-obscure term "high-tech" into everyday language. In 1979, the term high-tech appeared for the first time in a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine cartoon showing a woman berating her husband for not being high-tech enough: "You're middle-, middle-, middle-tech." After ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' excerpted Kron and Slesin's book in six installments, mainstream retailers across the United States, beginning with [[Macy's]] New York, started featuring high-tech decor in windows and in furniture departments. But credit should go to a shop on 64th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York, Ad Hoc Housewares, which opened in 1977,  for marketing these objects to a residential audience before anyone else. The book went on to be reprinted in England, France, and Japan, and like the original, each edition included a directory of local sources for the objects.

==Aims==
The high-tech architecture was, in some ways, a response to growing disillusionment with modern architecture. The realization of [[Le Corbusier]]'s urban development plans led to cities with monotonous and standardized buildings. Enthusiasm for economic building led to extremely low-quality finishes, with subsequent degradation countering a now-waning aesthetic novelty. High-tech architecture created a new aesthetic in contrast with standard modern architecture. In ''High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for The Home'', when discussing the high-tech aesthetic, the authors emphasized using elements "your parents might find insulting". This humor so aptly demonstrates the rebellious attitude.

Kron and Slesin further explain the term "high-tech" as one being used in architectural circles to describe an increasing number of residences and public buildings with a "nuts-and-bolts, exposed-pipes, technological look". A prime example of this is the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. This highlights one of the aims of high-tech architecture, to show the technical elements of the building by externalizing them. Thus, the technical aspects create the building's aesthetic.

For interior design, there was a trend of using formerly industrial appliances as household objects, e.g. [[Beaker (glassware)|chemical beakers]] as vases for flowers. This was because of an aim to use an industrial aesthetic. This was assisted by the conversion of former industrial spaces into residential spaces. High-tech architecture aimed to give everything an industrial appearance.

Another aspect to the aims of high-tech architecture was that of a renewed belief in the power of technology to improve the world. This is especially evident in [[Kenzo Tange]]'s plans for technically sophisticated buildings in [[Japan]]'s post-war boom in the 1960s, but few of these plans actually became buildings.
High-tech architecture aimed to achieve a new industrial aesthetic, spurred on by the renewed faith in the progression of technology.

But however prominent the industrial look appeared, the functional element of modern architecture was very much retained. The pieces still served a purpose in the building's function. The function of the building was also aimed as not being set. This dynamic property means that a building should be a "catalyst", the "technical services are provided but do not become set."

==Characteristics==
[[File:Berlin - ICC3.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin]] opened in 1979.]]
Structures of high-tech architecture have varied somewhat, yet all have accentuated technical elements. They included the prominent display of the building's technical and functional components, and an orderly arrangement and use of pre-fabricated elements. Glass walls and steel frames were also immensely popular.

To boast technical features, they were externalized, often along with load-bearing structures. There can be no more illustrious example than [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre.]] The [[Duct (HVAC)|ventilation ducts]] are all prominently shown on the outside. This was a radical design, as previous ventilation ducts would have been a component hidden on the inside of the building. The means of access to the building is also on the outside, with the large tube allowing visitors to enter the building.

The orderly and logical fashion in which buildings in the high-tech architectural style are designed to keep to their functional essence is demonstrated in [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]'s [[HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building|Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank HQ]]. Besides the technology being the overriding feature of the building, its design is very much functionally orientated. The large interior open space and the easy access to all floors enhance the function of being a bank. Also, the elements of the buildings are very neatly composed to achieve optimal orderliness in order to logically solve the problem of the needs of a bank. This can be seen in the levels' structure and in the escalators.

High-tech buildings make persistent use of glass curtain walls and steel structure. They are greatly indebted to modern architecture for this, and are influenced by [[Mies van der Rohe]]'s highrise buildings. [[Bruce Graham]]'s [[Willis Tower]] demonstrated that with glass walls and skeleton pipe structure of steel, a very tall building could be built. 
&lt;!--
High-tech architecture developed a technical language, free of historicist ornaments likes it predecessor, modern architecture. An example of this is the [[Žižkov Television Tower]], [[Prague]]. From afar the unconventional structure looks like a rocket launching pad. This takes inspiration from the technical advancements of the age. COMMENT: WHAT HAS THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A "TECHNICAL LANGUAGE"?
--&gt;
Many high-tech buildings meant their purposes to be dynamic. This could best be explained by [[Günther Behnisch]] and [[Frei Otto]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Munich Olympic Stadium]]. This structure made sport in the open possible and is meant to be used for many purposes. Originally an abandoned airfield, it is now a sports stadium, used for various disciplines.

Buildings designed in this style usually consist of a clear [[glass]] façade, with the building's network of support beams exposed behind it. Perhaps the most famous and easily recognized building built in this style is [[I.M. Pei]]'s [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] in [[Hong Kong]]. The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], although generally considered to be an [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] building, was technically a Structural Expressionist design due to its load-bearing steel frame.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}

The '''Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia''' ('''HILDA''')  [[statistical survey|survey]] is an Australian household-based [[panel study]] which began in 2001. It has been used for examining issues such as the incidence of persistent poverty; assets and income in the transition to retirement; the correlates and impact of changes in physical and mental health; and an international comparison of wealth and happiness. The survey is widely used by Australian and international researchers in the fields of [[economics]], [[social science]] and [[social policy]] and by the [[Australian Government]]. The HILDA survey is managed by a small team from [[the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the national fieldwork is carried out by [[ACNielsen]] and [[Roy Morgan Research]]. The survey is funded by the Australian Government through the [[Department of Social Services (Australia)|Department of Social Services]].

HILDA has the following key features: 

*It collects information about [[economic]] and subjective [[quality of life|well-being]], [[labor market|labour market]] dynamics and family dynamics. 
*Special questionnaire modules are included each wave and have covered topics such as [[wealth]], [[retirement]] and [[fertility]] intentions. 
*The wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 [[households]] and 19,914 individuals. In wave 11 this was topped up with an additional 2,153 households and 5,477 individuals
*Interviews are conducted annually with all adult members of each household. Children are interviewed once they turn 15.
*The panel members are followed over time. 
*Funding has been guaranteed for 18 waves, and the survey is expected to continue beyond wave 18.
*Data releases occur at the start of December. The release in December 2017 was for data collected from 2001 (wave 1) to 2016 (wave 16).

HILDA data, when weighted, describe the Australian population (excluding those not living in households). The datasets ([[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[Stata]] files) are available for legitimate research purposes and application can be made from the HILDA website. The data are confidentialised by suppression of geographic and other identifying information. A bibliography of published research, the survey [[methodology]], the [[questionnaires]] and a user manual are available from the HILDA website.

HILDA data are integrated into the [[Cross-National Equivalent File]] (CNEF) which contains population panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, Switzerland, Russia and the United States.

The '''ISRO Propulsion Complex''' ('''IPRC'''), located at [[Mahendragiri]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], is an [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] centre involved in testing, assembling, and integrating propulsion systems and stages that are developed at ISRO's [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre]]s. Formerly, IPRC was known as LPSC, Mahendragiri, functioning under [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre|LPSC]], Valiamala in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] of [[Kerala]]. It was elevated as an independent centre and renamed as IPRC with effect from February 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="ISRO"&gt;http://www.isro.gov.in/isrocentres/iprc.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lpsc-at-mahendragiri-elevated/article5641468.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-02-01/science/46897203_1_mahendragiri-vikram-sarabhai-space-centre-gslv&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the ISRO centres that could be called as the "Jet Propulsion Laboratory of India" as all liquid, [[cryogenic]] and [[semicryogenic]] stage and engine related tests of ISRO's launch vehicles and satellites are carried out here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/lpsc-mahendragiri-to-function-as-independent-unit-minister-114013100771_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">'''Information history''' may refer to the history of each of the categories listed below (or to combinations of them). It should be recognized that the understanding of, for example, libraries as information systems only goes back to about 1950. The application of the term ''information'' for earlier systems or societies is a [[retronym]].

==The word and concept "information"==
The Latin roots and Greek origins of the word "information" is presented by Capurro &amp; Hjørland (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Capurro, Rafael &amp; Hjørland, Birger (2003). The concept of information. Annual review of information science and technology (s. 343-411). Medford, N.J.: Information Today. A version retrieved November 6, 2011 from: http://www.capurro.de/infoconcept.html&lt;/ref&gt; References on "formation or molding of the mind or character, training, instruction, teaching" date from the 14th century in both English (according to [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) and other European languages. 
In the transition from Middle Ages to Modernity the use of the concept of information reflected a fundamental turn in epistemological basis – from "giving a (substantial) form to matter" to "communicating something to someone". Peters (1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13) concludes:

:Information was readily deployed in empiricist psychology (though it played a less important role than other words such as impression or idea) because it seemed to describe the mechanics of sensation: objects in the world inform the senses. But sensation is entirely different from "form" – the one is sensual, the other intellectual; the one is subjective, the other objective. My sensation of things is fleeting, elusive, and idiosynchratic [sic]. For Hume, especially, sensory experience is a swirl of impressions cut off from any sure link to the real world...  In any case, the empiricist problematic was how the mind is informed by sensations of the world. At first informed meant shaped by; later it came to mean received reports from. As its site of action drifted from cosmos to consciousness, the term's sense shifted from unities (Aristotle's forms) to units (of sensation). Information came less and less to refer to internal ordering or formation, since empiricism allowed for no preexisting intellectual forms outside of sensation itself. Instead, information came to refer to the fragmentary, fluctuating, haphazard stuff of sense. Information, like the early modern worldview in general, shifted from a divinely ordered cosmos to a system governed by the motion of corpuscles. Under the tutelage of empiricism, information gradually moved from structure to stuff, from form to substance, from intellectual order to sensory impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, J. D. (1988). Information: Notes Toward a Critical History. Journal of Communication Inquiry, 12, 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the most important influence on the concept of information is derived from the [[Information theory]] developed by Shannon and others. This theory, however, reflects a fundamental contradiction. Qvortrup (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Qvortrup, L. (1993). The controversy over the concept of information. An overview and a selected and annotated bibliography. Cybernetics &amp; Human Knowing 1(4), 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

:Thus, actually two conflicting metaphors are being used: The well-known metaphor of information as a quantity, like water in the waterpipe, is at work, but so is a second metaphor, that of information as a choice, a choice made by :an information provider, and a forced choice made by an :information receiver. Actually, the second metaphor implies that the information sent isn’t necessarily equal to the information received, because any choice implies a comparison with a list of possibilities, i.e., a list of possible meanings. Here, meaning is involved, thus spoiling the idea of information as a pure "Ding an sich." Thus, much of the confusion regarding the concept of information seems to be related to the basic confusion of metaphors in Shannon’s theory: is information an autonomous quantity, or is information always per se information to an observer? Actually, I don’t think that Shannon himself chose one of the two definitions. Logically speaking, his theory implied information as a subjective phenomenon. But this had so wide-ranging epistemological impacts that Shannon didn’t seem to fully realize this logical fact. Consequently, he continued to use metaphors about information as if it were an objective substance. This is the basic, inherent contradiction in Shannon’s information theory." (Qvortrup, 1993, p. 5)

In their seminal book ''The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages'',&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, Fritz &amp; Una Mansfield (eds.). 1983. The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Machlup and Mansfield (1983) collected key views on the interdisciplinary controversy in computer science, artificial intelligence, library and information science, linguistics, psychology, and physics, as well as in the social sciences. Machlup (1983,&lt;ref&gt;Machlup,Fritz. 1983. "Semantic Quirks in Studies of Information," pp. 641-71 in Fritz Machlup &amp; Una Mansfield, The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley.
&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;660) himself disagrees with the use of the concept of information in the context of signal transmission, the basic senses of information in his view al referring "to telling something or to the something that is being told. Information is addressed to human minds and is received by human minds." All other senses, including its use with regard to nonhuman organisms as well to society as a whole, are, according to Machlup, metaphoric and, as in the case of cybernetics, anthropomorphic.

Hjørland (2007) &lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). Information: Objective or Subjective/Situational?. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 58(10), 1448-1456.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fundamental difference between objective and subjective views of information and argues that the subjective view has been supported by, among others, Bateson,&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, G. (1972). Steps to an ecology of mind. New York: Ballantine.&lt;/ref&gt; Yovits,&lt;ref&gt;Yovits, M.C. (1969). Information science: Toward the development of a true scientific discipline.

An activity-theoretical approach to information science. Westport: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hjørland provided the following example: 
:A stone on a field could contain different information for different people (or from one situation to another). It is not possible for information systems to map all the stone’s possible information for every individual. Nor is any one mapping the one "true" mapping. But people have different educational backgrounds and play different roles in the division of labor in society. A stone in a field represents typical one kind of information for the geologist, another for the archaeologist. The information from the stone can be mapped into different collective knowledge structures produced by e.g. geology and archaeology. Information can be identified, described, represented in information systems for different domains of knowledge. Of course, there are much uncertainty and many and difficult problems in determining whether a thing is informative or not for a domain. Some domains have high degree of consensus and rather explicit criteria of relevance. Other domains have different, conflicting paradigms, each containing its own more or less implicate view of the informativeness of different kinds of information sources. (Hjørland, 1997, p. 111, emphasis in original).

==Academic discipline==
'''Information history''' is an emerging discipline related to, but broader than, [[library history]]. An important introduction and review was made by Alistair Black (2006).&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, A. (2006). Information history. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 40 , 441-473.&lt;/ref&gt;
A prolific scholar in this field is also Toni Weller, for example, Weller (2007, 2008, 2010a and 2010b).&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2007). Information history: its importance, relevance and future.  ASLIB Proceedings, 59(4-5), 437-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2008). Information History—An Introduction: Exploring an Emergent Field. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2010a), An Information History Decade: A Review of the Literature and Concepts, 2000–2009, Library &amp; Information History, 26 (1), 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (Ed) (2010b), Information History in the Modern World: Histories of the Information Age, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her work Toni Weller has argued that there are important links between the modern information age and its historical precedents.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (June 2010), 'The Victorian Information Age: Nineteenth Century Answers to Today's Information Policy Questions?', History &amp; Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris (November 2010), 'The Victorians were every bit as inquisitive as us', BBC History Magazine. http://www.historyextra.com/feature/victorians-were-every-bit-inquisitive-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Toni (2012), 'The Information State: A Historical Perspective on Surveillance' in Lyon, Haggerty &amp; Ball (Eds), Routledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies&lt;/ref&gt; A description from Russia is Volodin (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Volodin, B.F. (2000).  History of librarianship, library history, or information history: A view from Russia. Library Quarterly, 70(4), 446-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair Black (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;445) wrote: "This chapter explores issues of discipline definition and legitimacy by segmenting information history into its various components: 
* The history of print and written culture, including relatively long-established areas such as the histories of libraries and librarianship, book history, publishing history, and the history of reading.
* The history of more recent information disciplines and practice, that is to say, the history of information management, information systems, and information science.
* The history of contiguous areas, such as the history of the information society and information infrastructure, necessarily enveloping communication history (including telecommunications history) and the history of information policy.
* The history of information as social history, with emphasis on the importance of informal information networks."

"Bodies influential in the field include the American Library Association’s Round Table on Library History, the Library History Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), and, in the U.K., the Library and Information History Group of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP). Each of these bodies has been busy in recent years, running conferences and seminars, and initiating scholarly projects. Active library history groups function in many other countries, including Germany (The Wolfenbuttel Round Table on Library History, the History of the Book and the History of Media, located at the Herzog August Bibliothek), Denmark (The Danish Society for Library History, located at the Royal School of Library and Information Science), Finland (The Library History Research Group, University of Tamepere), and Norway (The Norwegian Society for Book and Library History). Sweden has no official group dedicated to the subject, but interest is generated by the existence of a museum of librarianship in Bods, established by the Library Museum Society and directed by Magnus Torstensson. Activity in Argentina, where, as in Europe and the U.S., a "new library history" has developed, is described by Parada (2004)." (Black (2006, p. 447).&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

==Information technology (IT)==
The term IT is ambiguous although mostly synonym with computer technology. Haigh (2011, pp. 432-433) wrote 
:"In fact, the great majority of references to information technology have always been concerned with computers, although the exact meaning has shifted over time (Kline, 2006). The phrase received its first prominent usage in a Harvard Business Review article (Haigh, 2001b;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2001b). Inventing information systems; The systems men and the computer, 1950-1968. Business History Review, 75(1), 15-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt &amp; Whisler, 1958&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt, H. J. &amp; Whisler, T. L. (1958). Management in the 1980s. Harward Business Review, 36(6), 41-48.&lt;/ref&gt;) intended to promote a technocratic vision for the future of business management. Its initial definition was at the conjunction of computers, operations research methods, and simulation techniques. Having failed initially to gain much traction (unlike related terms of a similar vintage such as information systems, information processing, and information science) it was revived in policy and economic circles in the 1970s with a new meaning. Information technology now described the expected convergence of the computing, media, and telecommunications industries (and their technologies), understood within the broader context of a wave of enthusiasm for the computer revolution, [[post-industrial society]], information society (Webster, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (1995). Theories of the information society. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;), and other fashionable expressions of the belief that new electronic technologies were bringing a profound rupture with the past. As it spread broadly during the 1980s, IT increasingly lost its association with communications (and, alas, any vestigial connection to the idea of anybody actually being informed of anything) to become a new and more pretentious way of saying "computer". The final step in this process is the recent surge in references to "information and communication technologies" or ICTs, a coinage that makes sense only if one assumes that a technology can inform without communicating".&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, Thomas (2011). The history of information technology. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45, 431-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people use the term ''information technology'' about technologies used before the development of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jeremy G. (1997). A History of Information Technology and Systems. http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is however to use the term as a [[retronym]].

"It is said that we live in an "Age of Information," but it is an open scandal that there is no theory, nor even definition, of information that is both broad and precise enough to make such an assertion meaningful." (Goguen, 1997).&lt;ref name="Goguen"/&gt;

The Danish Internet researcher Niels Ole Finnemann (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Finnemann, Niels Ole (2001). The Internet-A New Communicational Infrastructure. Manuscript for the 15th Nordic Conference on Media and Communication Research, "New Media, New opportunities, New Societies", University of Iceland in Reykjavik, Iceland, August 11th-13th, 2001. Tilgængelig: https://web.archive.org/web/20040328165322/http://cfi.imv.au.dk/pub/skriftserie/002_finnemann.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; developed a general history of media. He wrote: "A society cannot exist in which the production and exchange of information are of only minor significance. For this reason one cannot compare industrial societies to information societies in any consistent way. Industrial societies are necessarily also information societies, and information societies may also be industrial societies." He suggested the following media matrix:&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, James (2011).''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood.''New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Oral cultures based mainly on speech.
# Literate cultures: speech + writing (primary alphabets and number systems).
# Print cultures: speech + written texts + print.
# Mass-media cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media.
# Second-order alphabetic cultures: speech + written texts + print + analogue electric media + digital media.

Many information science historians cite [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] as the fathers of information science with the founding of the [[International Institute of Bibliography]] (IIB) in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W.

Medford, NJ: Information Today, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, information science emerged in the last part of the 19th century as [[documentation science]] which in general shifted name to [[information science]] in the 1960s.

Heting Chu (2010) classified the history and development of information representation and retrieval (IRR) in four phases. "The history of IRR is not long. A retrospective look at the field identifies increased demand, rapid growth, the demystification phase, and the networked era as the four major stages IRR has experienced in its development:" &lt;ref&gt;Chu, Heting (2010).’’  Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age’’, Second Edition. Medford, NJ: Information Today&lt;/ref&gt;

# Increased Demand (1940s–early 1950s) ([[Information explosion]])
# Rapid Growth (1950s–1980s) (the emergence of computers and systems such as [[Dialog (online database)]])
# Demystification Phase (1980s–1990s) (systems developed for end-user searching)
# The Networked Era (1990s–Present) (search enginees such as [[AltaVista]] and [[Google]])

The '''Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality''' (est. 1976) is an [[Unaccredited institutions of higher education|unaccredited]],&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;[[U.S. Department of Education]] [http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ "Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs].&lt;/ref&gt; for-profit, degree-granting institution and resource center in the field of [[sexology]] located in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="IASHS_home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iashs.edu/ |title=Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree and certificate programs focus on [[public health]], [[sex therapy]], and sexological research.

The Institute grew out of research in the 1960s highlighting the general lack of understanding of and formal training in human sexuality. The library and archives are a collection of [[Pornographic film|adult films]], academic [[Sexology|sexological]] and erotological resources, and [[sex therapy]] training materials.

The IASHS has trained many of the current directors of sexology programs in other countries. Most recently, a sister school of the IASHS has been launched in China.

Like all post-secondary schools in California, IASHS is required by California law to register with the State of California [[Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]], an anti-fraud or anti-[[diploma mill]] unit of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bppe.ca.gov/schools/accredited_institutions.shtml|title=Approval by Means of Accreditation Overview|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013 |quote=&lt;br&gt;'''Q'''.  Does the Bureau accredit institutions?&lt;br&gt; '''A'''. No. The Bureau approves a person to operate an institution in California. An approval to operate signifies that an institution is in compliance with state standards as set forth in the Private Postsecondary Education Act. Only accrediting agencies can accredit an institution. Accreditation is a voluntary non-governmental review process. On the other hand, state approval is mandatory for a person operating an institution subject to the [[California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;   IASHS has BPPE "approval to operate", which means that IASHS meets the minimum legal standards for "offering of ''bona fide'' instruction by qualified faculty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/default.asp|title=Approved Institutions|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The path that led to the founding of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in 1976 began in 1962 with a program called the National Young Adult Project (NYAP). Originating in the then Methodist Church, the NYAP ultimately became an ecumenical project that included the Evangelical United Brethren, Presbyterian Church USA, and United Church of Christ denominations on the national level. Other church bodies (African Methodist Episcopal, American Baptist, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, Protestant Episcopal, United Presbyterian Church in the USA, and Lutheran Church of America) also participated on a regional or local level. Dr. Ted McIlvenna, a Methodist minister, and cofounder, owner and president of the Institute, headed the San Francisco project for the NYAP. Of the 50+ nationwide projects the NYAP developed by 1968, only the three connected to him and to Glide Memorial Methodist Church had anything to do with sexuality issues. McIlvenna believed that there was a lack of research on human sexuality and the absence of demonstrated effective training and educational methodologies. A meeting in 1967 at the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]] led to the formation of the National Sex Forum as part of the [[Glide Foundation]] to address this lack.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994" /&gt;

By 1974, it was clear to the Forum that a free-standing institute dedicated to the study of and education and training in the emerging field of [[sexology]] was required. They divided the creation of the academic institute as: McIlvenna to re-envision the Forum as an academic setting; Laird Sutton to collect a graphic-resource library; Herbert Vandervoort to organize and prepare the academic work of the study team; and Marguerite Rubenstein, Loretta Haroian, and Phyllis Lyon to define the professional training standards for the new academically trained professional sexologists.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bullough, Bonnie |author2=Bullough, Vern L. |title=Human sexuality: an encyclopedia |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=310&amp;ndash;312 |isbn=0-8240-7972-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wardell Pomeroy]] was the first Academic Dean.&lt;ref name="HirsArch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CHR07.HTM#kopf |title=Archive for Sexology: Modern Sex Research (1938– ) |accessdate=2009-10-23 |publisher=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology at Humboldt University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was integral to the development of ''[[Humanistic psychology|humanistic sexology]]'', emphasizing experiential techniques and sexual pleasure over positivist empiricism. The culture of casual as well as clinical nudity and the inclusion of various [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] and [[erotic massage]] techniques led to the Institute being nicknamed "Fuck U" by some critics.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irvine, Janice M. |title=Disorders of desire: sexuality and gender in modern American sexology |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59213-151-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of [[Reichian therapy]] and other techniques not well founded in research has similarly led to criticism.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;

== Academics ==
Degrees are offered in Master of Human Sexuality, Master of Public Health in Human Sexuality, and Doctor of Human Sexuality, as well as Doctor of Education and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a focus in sexology and erotology. They also offer [[Professional certification|professional certificates]] in: Associate in [[Sex Education]], [[Clinical Sexology]], [[Sexological Bodywork]], Sexological Instructor/Advisor of AIDS/[[STI Prevention]], [[Sex Coaching]], and [[Erotology]] Certificates.

Coursework varies by degree sought, but includes formal academic lectures, group-based discussion, video lectures and webinars (which may be undertaken off-site as part of a [[distance education]] program), and hands-on training in therapy and [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]. Research-based degrees include independent or directed use of the Institute's extensive primary and secondary archives of sexological material.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="courses"&gt;[http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/courses.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the faculty listed on the Institute's website obtained their most advanced degree from the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/faculty-administration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
The Institute is not accredited.&lt;ref name="ed" /&gt; The Institute's FAQ page, in response to the question "Is the Institute an accredited academic institution?", states that the Institute is approved by the [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/view-school.asp?schlcode=3800061 Database record for IASHS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BPPE is not an [[List of recognized higher education accreditation organizations#United States|accrediting agency]]; the agency's main focus is on identifying [[diploma mills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read?GUID=17952325 | work=The Boston Globe | title=More financial news | date=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0651-0700/sb_675_cfa_20110428_143825_sen_comm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the BPPE sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/ntc_3800061.pdf Notice to Comply] to IASHS regarding several violations. In early 2016, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516058.pdf Citation: Assessment of Fine and Order of Abatement] to IASHS, for seven violations.

As of September 2014, IASHS is required by [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1247 CA SB1247] to seek and obtain accreditation.

[[Quackwatch]] identifies the Institute as a "Questionable Organization".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students at unaccredited institutions are never eligible for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], including [[student loans]], through any government agency. In some states, it can be illegal to use a degree from an unaccredited institution, unless approved by the state licensing agency.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/students/prep/college/diplomamills/accreditation.html Diploma Mills and Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt;

“We don’t take federal money and that’s why we won’t be accredited by the traditional state agencies. We don’t want to be handcuffed as to what we can provide, say and do. We’ve been approached by accrediting bodies run by Mormons and Roman Catholics that wanted us to change our code of ethics to promote contraception and change our name to reflect ‘family and marriage counseling’ instead of sexuality. We won’t do it,” according to IASHS founder Dr. Ted McIlvenna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In addition to its educational and archival mission, the Institute engages in outreach, such as teaching [[sex education]] to underserved teenagers in demographics at high risk for [[Teenage pregnancy|pregnancy]]. Ted McIlvenna, president of the Institute, favors a curriculum focusing on teaching teenagers techniques for "obtaining healthy, respectful relationships with their partners" rather than [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref name="sex-ed_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first=Phil | last=Busse | title=Birds don't do it, Bees don't do it: Surprise!

'''International relations theory''' is the study of [[international relations]] (IR) from a theoretical perspective. It attempts to provide a [[Model (abstract)|conceptual framework]] upon which international relations can be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irtheory.com/ |title=The IR Theory Home Page |website=Irtheory.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ole Holsti]] describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g., an adherent of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] may completely disregard an event that a [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most prominent theories are [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberalism]] and [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, institutionalism proposed and developed by Keohane and Nye is discussed as an paradigm differed from liberalism. 

International relations theories can be divided into "[[positivist]]/[[rationalist]]" theories which focus on a principally state-level analysis, and "[[Post-positivism in international relations theory|post-positivist]]/[[reflectivist]]" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security.  Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, [[Institutionalism in international relations|institutionalism]], [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxism]], [[neo-Gramscianism]], and others.  However, two [[positivist]] schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism. Constructivism, however, is increasingly becoming mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Reus-Smit, Christian. "Constructivism." ''Theories of International Relations'', ed. Scott Burchill ... [et al.], pp.209, 216. Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[international relations]], as theory, can be traced to [[E.H. Carr|E. H.

However, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th Century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by "[[Great Debates (international relations)|great debates]]", such as the realist-idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: "We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field". Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A clear distinction is made between explanatory and constitutive approaches when classifying international relations theories. Explanatory theories are ones which postulates the world is something external to theorize about. A constitutive theory is one which suggest that theories actually help construct the world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Owens, "Alternative approaches to international theory", "The Globalisation of World Politics", Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed p176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Realism in international relations|Realism]] or political realism&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/polreal/ |title=Political Realism &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been the dominant theory of [[international relations]] since the conception of the discipline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dunne, Tim and Schmidt, Britain, The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, p&lt;/ref&gt; The theory claims to rely upon an ancient tradition of thought which includes writers such as [[Thucydides]], [[Machiavelli]], and [[Hobbes]].  Early realism can be characterized as a reaction against interwar idealist thinking. The outbreak of [[World War II]] was seen by realists as evidence of the deficiencies of idealist thinking. There are various strands of modern-day realist thinking. However, the main tenets of the theory have been identified as statism, survival, and self-help.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*'''Statism:''' Realists believe that nation states are the main actors in international politics.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.59&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is a state-centric theory of international relations. This contrasts with liberal international relations theories which accommodate roles for [[non-state actors]] and international institutions. This difference is sometimes expressed by describing a realist world view as one which sees nation states as [[billiard balls]], liberals would consider relationships between states to be more of a [[cobweb theory|cobweb]].
*'''Survival:''' Realists believe that the international system is governed by anarchy, meaning that there is no central authority.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; Therefore, international politics is a struggle for power between self-interested states.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Jack, 'One World, Rival Theories, Foreign Policy, 145 (November/December 2004), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Self-help:''' Realists believe that no other states can be relied upon to help guarantee the state's survival.

Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that nation-states are unitary, geographically based actors in an [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchic]] international system with no authority above capable of regulating interactions between states as no true authoritative [[world government]] exists.  Secondly, it assumes that [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[Sovereign state|states]], rather than [[intergovernmental organization]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, or [[multinational corporation]]s, are the primary actors in international affairs.  Thus, states, as the highest order, are in competition with one another.  As such, a state acts as a [[rationality|rational]] autonomous actor in pursuit of its own self-interest with a primary goal to maintain and ensure its own security—and thus its sovereignty and survival.  Realism holds that in pursuit of their interests, states will attempt to amass [[Natural resource|resources]], and that relations between states are determined by their relative levels of [[power politics|power]]. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's military, economic, and political capabilities.

Some realists, known as human nature realists or classical realists,&lt;ref name="Mearsheimer 2001 25–26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mearsheimer|first=John|title=The Tragedy of Great Power Politics|year=2001|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-07624-0|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  believe that states are inherently aggressive, that territorial expansion is constrained only by opposing powers, while others, known as offensive/defensive realists,&lt;ref name="Mearsheimer 2001 25–26"/&gt; believe that states are obsessed with the security and continuation of the state's existence. The defensive view can lead to a [[security dilemma]], where increasing one's own security can bring along greater instability as the opponent(s) builds up its own arms, making security a zero-sum game where only ''relative gains'' can be made.

It is, however, only one strand of neorealism. [[Joseph Grieco]] has combined neo-realist thinking with more traditional realists. This strand of theory is sometimes called "modern realism".&lt;ref&gt;Lamy,Steven, Contemporary Approaches:Neo-realism and neo-liberalism in "The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed,p127&lt;/ref&gt; Waltz's neorealism contends that the effect of structure must be taken into account in explaining state behavior. Structure is defined twofold as: a) the ordering principle of the international system which is [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]], and b) the distribution of capabilities across units. Waltz also challenges traditional realism's emphasis on traditional military power, instead characterizing power in terms of the combined capabilities of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Steven, "Contemporary mainstream approaches: neo-realism and neo-liberalism", The Globalisation of World Politics, Smith, Baylis and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, pp.127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberalism==
{{Main|Liberalism in international relations}}
{{Further|Democratic peace theory|List of wars between democracies|Commercial liberalism|Sociological liberalism|Republican liberalism|Institutional liberalism|Neoliberalism}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Kant's writings on [[perpetual peace]] were an early contribution to [[democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;E Gartzk, Kant we all just get along? Opportunity, willingness, and the origins of the democratic peace, American Journal of Political Science, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The precursor to [[liberal international relations theory]] was "[[idealism (international relations)|idealism]]". Idealism (or [[utopianism]]) was viewed critically by those who saw themselves as "realists", for instance [[E. H. Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Schmidt, The political discourse of anarchy: a disciplinary history of international relations, 1998, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; In international relations, idealism (also called "[[Wilsonianism]]" because of its association with [[Woodrow Wilson]] who personified it) is a school of thought that holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, which would arise amongst the "institution-builders" after World War I.

Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior.  Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state actions.  Thus, preferences will vary from state to state, depending on factors such as [[culture]], [[economic system]] or [[Form of government|government type]].  Liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political/security ("[[high politics]]"), but also economic/cultural ("[[low politics]]") whether through commercial firms, organizations or individuals.  Thus, instead of an anarchic international system, there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power, such as [[cultural capital]] (for example, the influence of [[film]]s leading to the popularity of the country's culture and creating a market for its exports worldwide).  Another assumption is that [[absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]]s can be made through co-operation and [[interdependence]]—thus peace can be achieved.

The [[democratic peace]] theory argues that liberal democracies have never (or almost never) made war on one another and have fewer conflicts among themselves. This is seen as contradicting especially the realist theories and this empirical claim is now one of the great disputes in political science. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the democratic peace. It has also been argued, as in the book ''[[Never at War]]'', that democracies conduct diplomacy in general very differently from non-democracies. (Neo)realists disagree with Liberals over the theory, often citing structural reasons for the peace, as opposed to the state's government. [[Sebastian Rosato]], a critic of democratic peace theory, points to America's behavior towards left-leaning democracies in Latin America during the [[Cold War]] to challenge democratic peace.&lt;ref&gt;Rosato, Sebastian, The Flawed Logic of Democratic Peace Theory, American Political Science Review, Volume 97, Issue 04, November 2003,  pp.585–602&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that economic interdependence makes war between trading partners less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Dale, Economic Interdependence and War: A Theory of Trade Expectations, International Security, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Spring, 1996), pp.5–41&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast realists claim that economic interdependence increases rather than decreases the likelihood of conflict.

===Neoliberalism===
{{Main|Neoliberalism in international relations}}
Neoliberalism, liberal institutionalism or [[neo-liberal institutionalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Sutch, Peter, Elias, 2006, Juanita, International Relations: The Basics, Routledge p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  is an advancement of liberal thinking. It argues that international institutions can allow nations to successfully cooperate in the international system.

===Complex interdependence===
[[Robert Keohane|Robert O. Keohane]] and [[Joseph Nye|Joseph S. Nye]], in response to neorealism, develop an opposing theory they dub "[[complex interdependence]]." Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explain, "... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism." In explaining this, Keohane and Nye cover the three assumptions in realist thought: First, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and finally, the assumption that there is a hierarchy in international politics.

The heart of Keohane and Nye's argument is that in international politics there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional Westphalian system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to multinational corporations and organizations. Here they define their terminology; interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; transgovernmental relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; transnational applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channel as championed by realists.

Secondly, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations.

Finally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. The idea is developed that between countries in which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important in that "alliance's political and military relations with a rival bloc."

=== Post-liberalism ===
One version of post-liberal theory argues that within the modern, globalized world, states in fact are driven to cooperate in order to ensure security and sovereign interests. The departure from classical liberal theory is most notably felt in the re-interpretation of the concepts of [[sovereignty]] and [[autonomy]]. Autonomy becomes a problematic concept in shifting away from a notion of freedom, self-determination, and agency to a heavily responsible and duty laden concept. Importantly, autonomy is linked to a capacity for good governance. Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a shift from a right to a duty. In the global economy, [[International organizations]] hold sovereign states to account, leading to a situation where sovereignty is co-produced among "sovereign" states. The concept becomes a variable capacity of good governance and can no longer be accepted as an absolute right. One possible way to interpret this theory, is the idea that in order to maintain global stability and security and solve the problem of the anarchic world system in International Relations, no overarching, global, sovereign authority is created. Instead, states collectively abandon some rights for full autonomy and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=David|title=International Statebuilding – The Rise of the Post-Liberal Paradigm|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-42118-8|pages=43–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another version of post-liberalism, drawing on work in political philosophy after the end of the Cold War, as well as on democratic transitions in particular in Latin America, argues that social forces from below are essential in understanding the nature of the state and the international system. Without understanding their contribution to political order and its progressive possibilities, particularly in the area of peace in local and international frameworks, the weaknesses of the state, the failings of the liberal peace, and challenges to global governance cannot be realised or properly understood. Furthermore, the impact of social forces on political and economic power, structures, and institutions, provides some empirical evidence of the complex shifts currently underway in IR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richmond|first=Oliver|title=A Post-Liberal Peace|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-66784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructivism==

[[Constructivism in international relations|Constructivism]] or [[social constructivism]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121235514/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199285433/jackson_chap06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as a challenge to the dominance of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations theories.&lt;ref&gt;Hopf, Ted, The Promise of Constructivism in International Relations Theory, International Security, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Summer, 1998), p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Barnett describes constructivist international relations theories as being concerned with how ideas define international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states and how states and non-state actors reproduce this structure.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barnett, "Social Constructivism" in The Globalisation of World Politics, Baylis, Smith and Owens, 4th ed, OUP, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The key element of constructivism is the belief that "International politics is shaped by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identities." Constructivism argues that international reality is socially constructed by cognitive structures which give meaning to the material world.&lt;ref name="Alder, Emmanuel 1997, p.319"&gt;Alder, Emmanuel, Seizing the middle ground, European Journal of International Relations, Vol .3, 1997, p.319&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emerged from debates concerning the scientific method of international relations theories and theories role in the production of international power.&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Ferike, International Relations Theories:Discipline and Diversity, Dunne, Kurki and Smith, OUP, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emanuel Adler]] states that constructivism occupies a middle ground between rationalist and interpretative theories of international relations.&lt;ref name="Alder, Emmanuel 1997, p.319"/&gt;

Constructivist theory criticises the static assumptions of traditional international relations theory and emphasizes that international relations is a social construction. Constructivism is a theory critical of the ontological basis of [[rationalist]] theories of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;In international relations ontology refers to the basic unit of analysis that an international relations theory uses. For example for neorealists humans are the basic unit of analysis&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas realism deals mainly with security and material power, and liberalism looks primarily at economic interdependence and domestic-level factors, [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivism]] most concerns itself with the role of ideas in shaping the international system; indeed it is possible there is some overlap between constructivism and realism or liberalism, but they remain separate schools of thought. By "ideas" constructivists refer to the goals, threats, fears, identities, and other elements of perceived reality that influence states and non-state actors within the international system.  Constructivists believe that these ideational factors can often have far-reaching effects, and that they can trump materialistic power concerns.

For example, constructivists note that an increase in the size of the U.S. military is likely to be viewed with much greater concern in Cuba, a traditional antagonist of the United States, than in Canada, a close U.S. ally. Therefore, there must be perceptions at work in shaping international outcomes. As such, constructivists do not see [[wiktionary:anarchy|anarchy]] as the invariable foundation of the international system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irtheory.com/know.htm |title=The IR Theory Knowledge Base |website=Irtheory.com |date=2015-04-03 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather argue, in the words of [[Alexander Wendt]], that "anarchy is what states make of it".&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander, "Anarchy is what states make of it: the social construction of power politics" in ''International Organization'', vol. 46, no. 2, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivists also believe that [[social norms]] shape and change foreign policy over time rather than security which realists cite.

[[File:Gramsci.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Antonio Gramsci|Antonio Gramsci's]] writings on the [[hegemony]] of capitalism have inspired [[Marxist international relations theory|Marxist international relations]] scholarship]]
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Neo-Marxism|Neo-Marxist]] international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the [[realism in international relations|realist]]/[[Liberal international relations theory|liberal]] view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of [[historical materialism]] and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of ''class'' as the focus of study.  Marxists view the international system as an integrated [[capitalism|capitalist]] system in pursuit of [[capital accumulation]]. A sub-discipline of Marxist IR is [[Critical Security Studies]]. Gramscian approaches rely on the ideas of Italian [[Antonio Gramsci]] whose writings concerned the hegemony that capitalism holds as an ideology. Marxist approaches have also inspired [[Critical Theory|Critical Theorists]] such as [[Robert W. Cox]] who argues that "Theory is always for someone and for some purpose".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Robert, Social Forces, States and World Orders: Beyond International Relations Theory
Cox Millennium – Journal of International Studies.1981; 10: 126–155&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable Marxist approach to international relations theory is [[Immanuel Wallerstein|Immanuel Wallerstein's]] [[World-system theory]] which can be traced back to the ideas expressed by Lenin in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of capitalism. World-system theory argues that globalized capitalism has created a core of modern industrialized countries which exploit a periphery of exploited "Third World" countries. These ideas were developed by the Latin American [[Dependency School]]. "Neo-Marxist" or "New Marxist" approaches have returned to the writings of [[Karl Marx]] for their inspiration. Key "New Marxists" include [[Justin Rosenberg]] and [[Benno Teschke]]. Marxist approaches have enjoyed a renaissance since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

Criticisms of Marxists approaches to international relations theory include the narrow focus on material and economic aspects of life.

==Feminism==
{{Main|Feminism and international relations theory}}
{{Further|Bananas, Beaches and Bases|International Feminist Journal of Politics}}
Feminist approaches to international relations became popular in the early 1990s. Such approaches emphasize that women's experiences continue to be excluded from the study of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Marysia, "Do We Understand Each Other Yet? Troubling Feminist Encounters With(in)" ''British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations'', Volume 9, Issue 2 p.304&lt;/ref&gt; International Relations Feminists who argue that gender relations are integral to international relations focus on the role of diplomatic wives and marital relationship that facilitate sex trafficking. Early feminist IR approaches were part of the "[[Great Debates in international relations theory|Third Great Debate]]" between positivists and post-positivists. They argued against what they saw as the positivism and state-centrism of mainstream international relations. [[J. Ann Tickner]] argues that these approaches did not describe what a feminist perspective on world politics would look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tickner|first=J. Ann|date=1997-12-01|title=You Just Don't Understand: Troubled Engagements Between Feminists and IR Theorists|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/41/4/611/1786067/You-Just-Don-t-Understand-Troubled-Engagements|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=4|pages=611–632|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00060|issn=0020-8833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist international relations scholar [[Jacqui True]] differentiates between empirical feminism, analytical feminism and normative feminism. Empirical feminism sees women and gender relations as empirical aspects of international relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is argued that mainstream international relations emphasis on [[anarchy in international relations theory|anarchy]] and [[Public administration|statecraft]] mean that areas of study that make the reproduction of the state system possible are marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, R. and Newland, K. (eds) (1991) ''Gender and International Relations'', (London).&lt;/ref&gt; Analytical feminism claims that the theoretical framework of international relations has a gender bias. Here gender refers not to the "biological" differences between men and women but the social constructs of masculine and feminine identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;True, Jacqui, ''"Feminism" in Theories of International Relations'', Scott Burchill et al., 3rd ed, Palgrave, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that in mainstream international relations masculinity is associated with objectivity. Analytical feminists would see neo-realism's dislike of domestic explanations for explaining interstate behaviour as an example of this bias. Normative feminist sees theorizing as part of an agenda for change.

Criticisms of feminist international relations theory include its portrayal of women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, C, (1991) "Under Western Eyes:Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses" in C. Mohanty, T.A. Russo and L.Torres (ed), ''Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism'', Bloomington&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist International Relations is sometimes oversimplified into a women's issue or simply a need to 'add women and stir'. "Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics", an article by Charlotte Hooper, makes the case that looking at international relations through a gendered lens is important for all genders. The article illustrates that the hyper-masculinity used in international relations has a negative impact on all genders. It privileges only a certain kind of man, forcing all others to fit into the constraints of one vision of masculinity. Hooper also argues that this gendered lens requires a complete overhaul of traditional methods, rather than just adding women to the study. "In order to investigate the intersections between gender identities and international relations, one cannot rely on approaches which would take gender identities as 'givens' or as independent, externally derived variables".&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–491"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=Charlotte|title=Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics|journal=Review of International Studies|year=1999|volume=25|issue=3|pages=475–491|url=http://moodle.uvic.ca/file.php/26021/Masculinits_IR_Gender_Char_Hooper.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0260210599004751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional methods do not meet the needs of men or women. They attempt to reduce our needs to security, failing to take into account class, education level, gender, or experience. Hooper argues that traditional studies of international relations are causing us to miss many factors for more than just women and children.

To appeal to sympathetic sceptics, Hooper explains that international relations shapes masculinity in a way that affects us all. To establish this she explains that masculinity and femininity are social constructs that can be influenced by theories and discourse. Hooper turns so called feminist international relations into gendered international relations, which brings in all people and highlights the importance of new methods to the field. Genders just like class, ethnicity, age, etc. can help inform our understanding of how people and nations act and if we ignore the range of masculinities and femininities we are only working with half the puzzle. The system that Feminist International Relations is trying to subvert affects us all and influences many of our traditional theories. Hooper offers the example of war which has shaped the male body; it has created men as takers of life and women as givers of it.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–491"/&gt; We proceed to tell men they simply have more natural aggression. Hooper also illustrates the ways masculinity, like femininity, has been influenced by colonization. The hierarchy formed by colonization labels Asians as effeminate, Africans as savage and white men as the proper balance at the top the hierarchy. War and colonialism still influence international relations to a large extent.

{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}

Several alternative approaches have been developed based on [[foundationalism]], [[anti-foundationalism]], [[positivism]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]]. These theories however are not widely known.

Behaviouralism in international relations theory is an approach to international relations theory which believes in the unity of science, the idea that the social sciences are not fundamentally different from the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Robert, Sorensen, Georg, “Introduction to International Relations: Theories and Approaches", OUP, 3rd ed, p305&lt;/ref&gt;

==English School==
{{Main|English school of international relations theory}}

The "[[English school of international relations theory|English School]]" of international relations theory, also known as International Society, Liberal Realism, Rationalism or the British institutionalists, maintains that there is a 'society of states' at the international level, despite the condition of "anarchy", i.e., the lack of a ruler or world state. Despite being called the English School many of the academics from this school were neither English nor from the United Kingdom.

A great deal of the work of the English School concerns the examination of traditions of past international theory, casting it, as [[Martin Wight]] did in his 1950s-era lectures at the [[London School of Economics]], into three divisions:
* Realist or Hobbesian (after [[Thomas Hobbes]])
* Rationalist (or Grotian, after [[Hugo Grotius]])
* Revolutionist (or Kantian, after [[Immanuel Kant]])
In broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or via media) between the power politics of realism and the "utopianism" of revolutionism. The English School reject [[behavioralist]] approaches to international relations theory. The international relations theories have become a typical learning of the fundamental insight and origin of international relations.

== Functionalism ==
{{Main|Functionalism in international relations}}

Functionalism is a theory of international relations that arose principally from the experience of [[European integration]].  Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states.  Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This "[[invisible hand]]" of integration phenomenon is termed "spillover". Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses.  This usage, and the usage in [[functionalism in international relations]], is the less common meaning of ''functionalism''.

More commonly, however, functionalism is an argument that explains phenomena as functions of a system rather than an actor or actors. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] employed a functionalist theory when he argued that the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] international political system arose to secure and protect the developing international capitalist system.  His theory is called "functionalist" because it says that an event was a function of the preferences of a system and not the preferences of an agent.  Functionalism is different from structural or realist arguments in that while both look to broader, structural causes, realists (and structuralists more broadly) say that the structure gives incentives to agents, while functionalists attribute causal power to the system itself, bypassing agents entirely.

==Post-structuralism==
Post-structuralism differs from most other approaches to international politics because it does not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter. Instead, post-structuralism is an approach, attitude, or ethos that pursues critique in particular way.  Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives. It states that "Every understanding of international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and interpretation". Scholars associated with post-structuralism in international relations include [[Richard K. Ashley]], [[James Der Derian]], [[Michael J. Shapiro]], [[R. B. J. Walker]], and [[Lene Hansen]].

==Post-modernism==
{{Main|Post-modernism and international relations theory}}
Post-modernist approaches to international relations are critical of [[metanarratives]]  and denounces traditional IR's claims to truth and neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asrudiancenter.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/krause_dornelles1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328002625/http://asrudiancenter.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/krause_dornelles1.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postcolonialism==
{{main|Postcolonialism and international relations theory}}
Postcolonial International relations scholarship posits a [[critical theory]] approach to [[International relations]] (IR), and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship. [[Post-colonialism]] focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Smith and Owens, ''The Globalisation of World Politics'', OUP, 4th ed,  p187-189&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary perspectives ==
Evolutionary perspectives, such as from [[evolutionary psychology]], have been argued to help explain many features of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|last2=Davenport|first2=Christian|date=2017-01-25|title=Toward an Evolutionary Theory of International Relations|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics|url=http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-294|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans in the ancestral environment did not live in states and likely rarely had interactions with groups outside of a very local area. However, a variety of evolved psychological mechanisms, in particular those for dealing with inter group interactions, are argued to influence current international relations. These include evolved mechanisms for social exchange, cheating and detecting cheating, status conflicts, leadership, [[ingroup and outgroup]] distinction and biases, coalitions, and violence. Evolutionary concepts such as [[inclusive fitness]] may help explain seeming limitations of a concept such as [[egotism]] which is of fundamental importance to realist and [[rational choice theory|rational choice]] international relations theories.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley A. Thayer. Darwin and International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. 2004. University Press of Kentucky.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bradley A.

== Neuroscience and IR ==
In recent years, with significant advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging tools, IR Theory has benefited from further multidisciplinary contributions. Prof. [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] from Oxford University has argued that neuroscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Neuro-philosophy-of-International-Relations.php |title=Neuro-philosophy of International Relations &amp;#124; Nayef Al-Rodhan |website=Themontrealreview.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can significantly advance the IR debate as it brings forward new insights about human nature, which is at the centre of political theory. New tools to scan the human brain, and studies in neurochemistry allow us to grasp what drives divisiveness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nayef Al-Rodhan |url=http://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/us-versus-neurophilosophy-explains-divided-politics/ |title=Us versus Them. How neurophilosophy explains our divided politics - OxPol |website=Blog.politics.ox.ac.uk |date=2016-10-19 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; conflict, and human nature in general. The theory of human nature in Classical Realism, developed long before the advent of neuroscience, stressed that egoism and competition were central to human behaviour, to politics and social relations. Evidence from neuroscience, however, provides a more nuanced understanding of human nature, which Prof. Al-Rodhan describes as emotional amoral egoistic. These three features can be summarized as follows: 1. emotionality is more pervasive than rationality and central to decision-making, 2. we are born neither moral, nor immoral but ''amoral'', and circumstances decide how our moral compass will develop, and finally, 3. we are egoistic insofar as we seek to ensure our survival, which is a basic form of egoism. This neurophilosophy of human nature can also be applied to states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nayef Al-Rodhan |url=http://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/the-emotional-amoral-egoism-of-states/ |title=The emotional amoral egoism of states - OxPol |website=Blog.politics.ox.ac.uk |date=2016-10-19 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; - similarly to the Realist analogy between the character (and flaws) of man and the state in international politics. Prof Al-Rodhan argues there are significant examples in history and contemporary politics that demonstrate states behave less rationality than IR dogma would have us believe: different strategic cultures, habits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=European Journal of International Relations : The logic of habit in International Relations |journal=European Journal of International Relations |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=539–561 |doi=10.1177/1354066110363502 |year = 2010|last1 = Hopf|first1 = Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[identity politics]] influence state conduct, geopolitics and diplomacy in profound ways.

== Queer and transgender perspectives ==

Queer international relations scholarship aims to broaden the scope and method of traditional international relations theory to include sexed and gendered approaches that are often excluded in the discipline at large. While affiliated with [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], as well as [[post-structuralism]], queer IR theory is not reducible to any other field of international relations scholarship. Queer international relations theory works to expose the many ways in which sexualities and gender affect international politics. This includes the ways in which [[queer]] subjects and practices are disciplined, normalized, or capitalized on by traditional sites of power; how queer identities have often been the focus of domestic and foreign policy in [[heteronormative]] states; and how the order-versus-anarchy dichotomy in traditional international relations theory socially manifests itself in normal-versus-perverse and hetero/homo-normative versus queer dichotomies. Queer IR theory takes sites of traditional international relations scholarship (war and peace, [[international political economy]], and state and nation building) as its subjects of study. It also expands its scope and methods beyond those traditionally utilized in Realist IR scholarship. [[Ontologically]], queer IR utilizes a different scope from traditional IR, as it aims to non-monolithically address the needs of various queer groups, including [[Transgender|trans]]-, inter-, cross-, and pan- gendered, sexed, and sexualized bodies. [[Epistemologically]], queer IR explores alternative methodologies to those traditionally used in IR, as it emphasizes the sexual dimension of knowledge within international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Cynthia. “Queer International Relations: From Queer to Queer IR.” International Studies Review 16 (2014). 596–622. Web. March 10. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism for queer theory in general, and queer international relations in particular, addresses worries of the minimization or exclusion of certain groups. While queer IR incorporates [[transgender]] individuals in its expanded scope, some argue its emphasis on sexuality fails to adequately capture transgender experiences. [[Susan Stryker]] contests that queer theory’s approach merely treats the ‘T’ in LGBT as another, detached genre of sexual identity, “rather than perceived, like race or class, as something that cuts across existing sexualities, revealing in often unexpected ways the means through which all identities achieve their specificities.” While queer theoretical spaces remain friendly to transgender work, Stryker argues that ‘queer’ often acts as code for ‘gays’ or ‘lesbians,’ implicitly excluding transgender issues by privileging sexual orientations and identities. This leads Stryker to advocate that transgender studies follows its own trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, Susan. “Transgender Studies: Queer Theory’s Evil Twin.” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 10.2 (2004). 212–215. Web. March 21. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Sjoberg]] advocates for allying trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing in IR. She suggests some possible improvements that trans-theorizing may offer for feminist IR theory, which include a more nuanced understanding of gender hierarchy through a pluralist approach to sex, a holistic view of gender that resists viewing gender entirely either as a social construction or as [[gender essentialism|biologically essential]], and an increased awareness of gender as involving power relations among different sexes and genders. Additionally, Sjoberg argues, trans-theorizing makes important contributions to traditional IR’s understanding of global politics. Discussions of ‘[[coming out|outness]],’ visibility, invisibility, and hypervisibility in transgender theorizing are applicable to questions of identity, relations between individuals and groups, and the enforcement of [[norm (social)|norms]] in IR. Additionally, transgender understandings of [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]] and liminality can fill the gap in traditional IR’s need for an account of change and unrest in the international system. Moreover, talk of “crossing” and “[[passing (gender)|passing]]” in trans-theorizing may assist in explaining the process, logic, and consequences of states shifting identities. Finally, transgender disidentification, either from exclusionary movements or from their assigned sex, can help in unpacking “the problem of difference” in international relations. As such, Sjoberg advocates for the inclusion of trans-theorizing in feminist IR theory in the interests of improving explanations and understandings of global politics.&lt;ref&gt;Sjoberg, Laura. “Towards Trans-gendering International Relations?” International Political Sociology 6 (2013). 337–354. Web. April 7. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA)''' is an Israeli research institute specializing in public diplomacy and foreign policy founded in 1976. Currently, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's research portfolio consists of five primary initiatives: the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA), Defensible Borders Initiative, Jerusalem in International Diplomacy, Iran and the New Threats to the West, and Combating Delegitimization.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the think-tank concentrates on the topics of Iran, Radical Islam, the Middle East, Israel, the Peace Process, Jerusalem, Anti-Semitism, and World Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/#&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also publishes the academic journal, ''[https://www.jstor.org/journal/jewpolstudrev Jewish Political Studies Review]''. The journal is published biannually and is "the first and only journal dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs."&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Political Studies Review," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/jpsr-back-issues/jpsr-about/&lt;/ref&gt; The research institute is a registered non-profit organization and produces content in English, Hebrew, French, and German.&lt;ref&gt;"Support Us," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/support-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also produces the ''[http://www.dailyalert.org/ Daily Alert]'' for the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], a daily news summary and analysis concerning Israel, Iran, radical Islam, and other regional security issues distributed through email.&lt;ref&gt;"Daily Alert," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, June 13, 2017, http://www.dailyalert.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research behind the ''Daily Alert'' is conducted by the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs Director of Internet Publishing Mark Amiel.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;"Key People," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/key-people/&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''Daily Alert'' is published in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs office in Jerusalem, the time-zone difference between its publication and much of its targeted audience in Europe and North America is greatly beneficial. In part, the project was conceived to ensure that politicians and thought leaders would have an authoritative source of the most important daily news on their desk every morning. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs website, a member of the United States Department of State commented that, "The [Daily] ''Alert'' is one of the first things I turn to in the morning for information and insight on what may be the talk of the town that day. I'm better prepared because of them."&lt;ref&gt;"What Readers Say About Daily Alert," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/what-readers-say-about-daily-alert/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by [[Daniel Elazar]] as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family.&lt;ref name="Elazar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/vp-420-gerstenfeld.htm |title=The Intellectual World of Daniel Elazar |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of [[Uruguay]] from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="Uruguay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8-ZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6410%2C1424678 |title=Uruguay Embassy Leaves Jerusalem |publisher=The Age |date=1980-08-18 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/our-building-a-protected-jerusalem-landmark/ |title=Our Building: A Protected Jerusalem Landmark |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Dore Gold]], Israel’s former ambassador to the [[UN]] and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/about/|title=About the Jerusalem Center |publisher=jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2015, when he took a [[leave of absence]] to become director-general of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=Dore Gold picked as new Foreign Ministry director-general|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Dore-Gold-picked-as-new-Foreign-Ministry-director-general-404015|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://jcpa.org/dore-gold-returns-to-head-the-jerusalem-center-for-public-affairs/ Dore Gold has returned] as president of the Jerusalem Center.

A continuing project dating back to the early-2000s, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has made explicit their stance on the matter, particularly in a YouTube video released in May 2010.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;"Israel's Critical Security Needs for a Viable Peace," The Jerusalem Center, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWmPqY8TE0&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Jordan Rift Valley, the organization is opposed to the presence of international peacekeeping troops given their poor track-record in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and Southern Lebanon (see [[United Nations Emergency Force]] and [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]). Accordingly, the organization argues that Israel must retain control of the Jordan Valley. Concerning the future of the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs advocates for demilitarization and Israel's ability to exercise control of airspace and electromagnetic communications throughout Judea and Samaria (otherwise known as the West Bank).

Research conducted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs fellow Nadav Shragai, as well as, the organization's program ''Jerusalem in International Diplomacy'' maintain that Jerusalem should remain unified and under Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Jerusalem in International Diplomacy," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/jerusalem/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the organization is unequivocally opposed, and actively seeks to undermine, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Another core program of the institute, ''Combating Delegitimization and BDS'', alongside the work of scholar Dan Diker demonstrates the movement's objectives of achieving a one-state solution, dismantling Israel, and its correlation with anti-Semitism incidents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Combating Delegitimization and BDS," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/combating-delegitimization-and-bds/&lt;/ref&gt;

The think-tank is a supporter of the two-state solution calling for a "demilitarized Palestinian state" alongside Israel.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

As well, it should be noted that the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs does not comment, publish, or advocate any explicit policy decisions concerning Israeli domestic security. Accordingly, no articles, videos, or major publications on the think-tank's website will discuss political coalitions in Israel nor mention its major parties (e.g. Likud, Zionist Union, etc.).

==Institutes and publications==
The Jerusalem Center founded the '''Institute for Contemporary Affairs''' (ICA) jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation.&lt;ref name="Melson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeforecast.org/richard863/MIDDLEEAST/JCPA-ISRAELIZATIONOFWASHINGTON.html |title=Israelization of Washington Policy: the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |publisher=CambridgeForecast.org |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director of the ICA is Ambassador [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambassadoralanbaker.com/about/ |title=About Alan Baker |publisher=AmbassadorAlanBaker.com |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112233533/http://ambassadoralanbaker.com/about/ |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this outlet, the JCPA publishes ''Jerusalem Issue Briefs'' and ''Jerusalem Viewpoints''.&lt;ref name="ICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/program/institute-for-contemporary-affairs/ |title=Institute of Contemporary Affairs |publisher =JCPA.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also publish the twice-yearly ''Strategic Perspectives'', special reports presenting studies on Israeli security and diplomacy topics by the Contributing Editors board of the ICA.&lt;ref name="StratPer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=45269 |title=JCPA Strategic Perspectives |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCPA is also the publisher of the ''Jewish Political Studies Review'', an academic journal which publishes articles on Jewish public affairs, Jewish institutions and behavior, and Jewish political thought. It is published twice yearly.&lt;ref name="JPSR"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction |journal=Jewish Political Studies Review |volume=23 |date=Spring 2011 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, JCPA founded the '''Institute for Global Jewish Affairs''' in response to growing international anti-Semitism. Directed by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the institute addresses a variety of topics related to Jewish communities around the world.&lt;ref name="ovguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/institute-for-global-jewish-affairs-9202a8c04000641f8000000009273a03#|title=Watch "Institute for Global Jewish Affairs" Video|work=OVGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute helps direct the "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project" and its associated monthly publication "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," both of which attend to global anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="unmaskedthemovie.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmaskedthemovie.com/learn_more/related_websites.html|title=UNMASKED JUDEOPHOBIA - The Threat to Civilization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More can be learned about these below in the Programs and Initiatives section. The JCPA also produces a related publication entitled "Changing Jewish Communities," which is less focused on global anti-Semitism and, therefore, addresses a wide variety of issues related to global Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/results.cfm?PublicationName=Changing%20Jewish%20Communities|title=Publication name Changing Jewish Communities  - Berman Jewish Policy Archive @ Stanford University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the JCPA has organized a publication called "Jewish Environmental Studies," which looks deeply at Jewish environmental studies as a separate and important field and analyzes Jewish environmental thought through references from the [[Bible]] and classic Jewish texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3847|title=Jewish Environmental Studies: a New Field|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their written publications, the JCPA produces numerous videos that analyze a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and the Middle East. These include videos created by the center as well as videos of JCPA contributors appearing in various news outlets or conference venues. The videos can be found on the JCPA website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/media/videos/|title=TheJerusalemCenter|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the JCPA’s YouTube page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJerusalemCenter|title=TheJerusalemCenter|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent publications==

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has recently published multiple studies relating to Israeli security, international diplomacy, and the status of Jerusalem. As part of the organization's emphasis on making their material public and accessible, all of their major survey studies are digitalized and published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the so-called 'Knife Intifada', the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs published a collection edited by in-house scholar [[Fiamma Nirenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiamma Nirenstein, ed., "Lessons from Israel's Response to Terrorism," 2017, http://jcpa.org/lessons-israels-response-terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative project features articles by, among others, former Ambassadors Dore Gold, 
Alan Baker, and Freddy Eytan, as well as Brigadier General Yossi Kuperwasser and Dan Diker. The overarching theme of the publication focused on the similarity, rather than the misconceived differences, between terrorism in Israel and Europe. Moreover, several articles presented a valuable sociological exploration of Israeli society and its penchant for preparedness, vigilance, and resilience.

Another seminal work published in 2016 by in-house scholar Dan Diker was an in-depth exploration of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS) movement. Entitled ''[http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends]'', Diker traces the roots of the BDS movement arguing that it represents only the most recent incarnation of a historical attempt to boycott Israel. The publication also references foundational members of BDS (e.g. [[Omar Barghouti]]) in demonstrating the movement's support for the one-state solution and dismantling of the Israeli state.&lt;ref name="Dan Diker"&gt;Dan Diker, BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2016), 6-8, http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6&amp;ndash;8}} The book also demonstrates a powerful relationship between BDS activities and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses.&lt;ref name="Dan Diker"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jerusalem also features largely in the think-tank's work. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs scholar, [[Nadav Shragai]], published a historical and legal evaluation of Jerusalem and the city's role in final status peace negotiations entitled ''&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"&gt;Nadav Shragai, Jerusalem: Delusions of Division (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;''. Informed, in part, by recent polling data from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Shragai argues that a majority of Jerusalem's Arabs favour preserving their Israeli citizenship rather than substituting it for a Palestinian one.&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"/&gt;{{rp|Preface}} More importantly for Shagrai, Jerusalem's Arab community is increasingly being incorporated into the Jewish municipal fabric and represents a valuable dimension to future negotiations over the status of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"/&gt;{{rp|Introduction}}

==Conferences==

On March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled "Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm." The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and [[Europe]], including topics such as economics and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]] movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in ''[[The Times of Israel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-ready-to-pay-palestinians-who-renounce-right-of-return/|title=EU ready to pay Palestinians who renounce right of return|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/EU-aid-package-meant-to-assure-Israel-that-Palestine-wont-become-a-failed-state-346334|title=EU aid package meant to assure Israel that ‘Palestine’ won't become a failed state|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; J-Wire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406204045/http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |archivedate=2014-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ynetnews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4502877,00.html|title=EU-Israel ties growing, despite disagreements|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CBN News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2014/March/Israeli-EU-Trade-Relations-in-Tact/|title=Israeli, EU Trade in Tact Despite BDS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and initiatives==

===Defensible Borders initiative===

One of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs major research initiatives, Defensible Borders for Israel, seeks to "analyzes current terror threats and Israel's corresponding territorial requirements, particularly in the strategically vital West Bank." The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs maintains that Israel must continue to exercise this right to preserve Israel's security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;"Defensible Borders for Israel," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/defensible-borders-for-israel/&lt;/ref&gt;

The program's inception dates back to a joint conference with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in 2004. Accordingly, the think-tank deepened its ties with organizations including the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Herzliya Conference based on presentations concerning "defensible borders". According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the organization played a pivotal role in publicizing the term "defensible borders" and its ascension within the lexicon of contemporary Middle Eastern security issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Defensible Borders for Israel," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/defensible-borders-for-israel&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affair's most recent publication emanating from this initiative was published in 2014 entitled, [http://jcpa.org/requirements-for-defensible-borders/ ''Israel's Critical Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundation for a Secure Peace'']. The monograph is the latest version of an earlier study, ''Israel's Critical Security Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundations for a Viable Peace''. Most of the updated material was added in late 2013 and early 2014. The publication included sections written by [[Moshe Ya'alon|Moshe Yaalon]], [[Dore Gold]], [[Uzi Dayan]], [[Yossi Kuperwasser]], and [[Dan Diker]]. The content ranged from Israel's long-term security needs and defensible borders, to the shortcomings of United Nations Resolution 242 and key principles for a demilitarized Palestinian state.

===Combating delegitimization and BDS===

A core component of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs concerns efforts by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to [[Delegitimisation|delegitimize]] Israel. According to the organization's website, the initiative "is a major multilingual public diplomacy program" which seeks to expose those who undermine Israel's very legitimacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This programme entails reinforcing the connection between "the Jewish people and their historical homeland including Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Many of the institute's scholars, including Dan Diker and Ambassador Alan Baker, have published extensively on subjects pertaining to this initiative. This includes Dan Diker's ''[http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends]'' as well as Ambassador Baker's ''[http://jcpa.org/overview_palestinian_manipulation/ Palestinian Manipulation of the International Community]''.

===Jerusalem in international diplomacy===

Jerusalem's centrality to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has ensured that it is a subject which garners disproportionate scrutiny.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The intermingling of religious, political, and legal dimensions has encouraged the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to publish extensively on the subject. Spearheaded by Nadav Shragai, the initiative has led to such publications as, ''[http://jcpa.org/jerusalem-delusions-division/ Jerusalem: Delusions of Division]'' (2015), ''Jerusalem: Correcting the International Discourse'' (2012), and ''[http://jcpa.org/al-aksa-is-in-danger-libel/ The 'Al-Aksa Is in Danger Libel: The History of a Lie]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;"Nadav Shragai," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/researcher/nadav-shragai/&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined in the organization's policy video, the interlocking Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods of Jerusalem make division unfeasible. Mindful of Jerusalem's history during the Jordanian occupation when religious freedoms were curtailed, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs believes that the city must remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Iran and the New Threats to the West===

This program focuses on security threats posed by Iran to Israel and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/about/|title=About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began with a publication entitled “Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide,” authored by [[Dore Gold]] and [[Elie Wiesel]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots777=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=43807|title=Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide|author=ISN Editors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was created in response to multiple threats directed toward Israel by the Iranian leader, including a 2006 declaration that “Israel should be wiped off the map.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105105359/http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCPA continues to monitor security threats posed by Iran in the post-Ahmadinejad era with this program.

===Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project===

Initiated by [[Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the program focuses on anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and "its origins and lessons, manifestations and mutations."&lt;ref name="gerstenfeld"&gt;"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/publication/phas/&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative produces a monthly publication which addresses issues concerning past and presents acts directed against World Jewry and, among other issues, highlights anti-Israel boycotts, the manipulation of Holocaust history, and anti-Semitism emanating from Muslim and Christian communities. The program consists of conferences, seminars, lectures, interviews, and essays. As well, its content is available in English and French. The most recent publication, "[http://jcpa.org/article/why-new-academic-discipline-post-holocaust-studies-established-what-content/ Why a New Academic Discipline of Post-Holocaust Studies Should Be Established and What Its Content Should Be]", argues that while the Holocaust has been instrumental in shaping modern society, its study is often confined to mass murder while its continued influence today is often neglected.&lt;ref name="gerstenfeld"/&gt;

===Global Law Forum===

This program covers issues pertaining to Israel and international law. The goal of the program is to “protect Israel’s legal rights in its conflict with the Palestinians, the Arab world, and radical Islam.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=wYZdOSthmdoC |page=237 |title=Israel’s Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include the legality of settlements, human rights, and Israeli border issues, among others. [[Avi Bell]] directs the program. Additional contributors include Robert Sabel, [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Irit Kohn, [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]], [[Meir Rosenne]], and [[Justus Weiner]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The '''Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC''' ('''JIVE''') was formed in 1993 by the European Consortium for VLBI and is the central facility of the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN). In 2015, JIVE became a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = ERIC decision for JIVE | publisher = JIVE | date = 2014-12-11 | url = http://www.jive.eu/eric-decision-jive | accessdate = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([[VLBI]]) is a type of [[astronomical interferometry]] used in [[radio astronomy]]. It allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.

Normally the participating radio telescopes function individually, working on their own specific projects. In the case of VLBI, they all observe the same source at the same time, allowing much higher spatial resolution. There are many complex and challenging hurdles that need to be overcome to enable this effort. One challenge is the data processing requirement. JIVE operates the "EVN Data Processor" - a special-purpose [[supercomputer]] for [[astronomical]] [[VLBI]] data correlation. In a recent demonstration of JIVE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = European VLBI Network to participate in "100 Hours of Astronomy" with live webcast and e-VLBI observations | publisher = JIVE | date = 2009-03-16 | url = http://www.jive.nl/press_release_EVN_100Hrs.html | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090719182456/http://www.jive.nl/press_release_EVN_100Hrs.html | archivedate = 2009-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 telescopes from in Australia, Chile, China, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, [[Puerto Rico]], Spain, Sweden and the UK participated in joint observations of the active galaxy 3C120. The participating telescopes included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Verkouter | first = Harro | title = April 3 and 5th 2009 | url = http://iya.expres-eu.org/index.html | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20090712044638/http://iya.expres-eu.org/index.html | archivedate = 2009-07-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the 26 meter telescope at [[Hobart]], operated by the [[University of Tasmania]];
* the 22m dish of Mopra, part of the Long Baseline Array, operated by [[CSIRO]];
* the 25m dish of [[Sheshan Island|Sheshan]] near [[Shanghai]], operated by the [[Shanghai Astronomical Observatory]], [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]];
* the 14m [[Metsähovi Radio Observatory|Metsähovi]] dish, operated by the [[Aalto University]];
* the 32m telescope of [[Toruń]];
* the 32m telescope at [[Medicina]], operated by the [[Instituto Nazionale di Astrofisica]];

* the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]];
* the [[Yebes Observatory RT40m|Yebes 40m]], operated by the [[Spanish National Observatory|Observatorio Astronomico Nacional]];
* the 300m dish of [[Arecibo]], located in [[Puerto Rico]];
* the 6m dish of TIGO, operated by the Geodätisches Observatorium Wettzell.

The observations of the European VLBI Network are now carried out in real-time, thus earning the name of e-VLBI, or real-time, electronic Very Long Baseline Interferometry. The telescopes are then linked via high-speed [[national research and education networks]] (NRENs) which overcome some of the performance drawbacks of [[TCP/IP]] and [[UDP/IP]] (networking protocols) to allow sharing large volumes of data for immediate use. Such high-speed networks eliminate the shipping of disks of data from separate observations for correlation, thus allowing astronomers to respond to events as they happen in real time. The [[VLBI]] data are streamed to the JIVE, where they are correlated and the final, high-resolution image created.

JIVE is funded by the following national research councils and national facilities.

* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)
* National Institute for Astrophysics ([[INAF]])
* National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([[National Astronomical Observatory of China|NAOC]])

'''The Life Cube Project''' is a community interactive art installation based upon the creator's idea that if you write something down, it is far more likely to happen. The Life Cube installation encourages members of the community and the general public to decorate it with inspirational writing, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[mural]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]] for all its visitors to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109172409/http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through four iterations at the annual Burning Man festival in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015; thousands of participants touched, climbed, inscribed, painted, and added their personal visions to the Life Cube. In 2014, the Life Cube Project made its way out of Burning Man and into its first major city in the United States as experiential and [[interactive art]].

==History of the Life Cube at Burning Man==
Over the course of three years, and returning as an Honorarium project in 2015, the Artist and his project team designed, built, and burned Life Cubes at [[Burning Man]]. The first Life Cube, an eight-foot square, was planned in 2010 and erected in 2011, and the artist was motivated to build another version of the Life Cube the following year. In 2012, its dimensions expanded to sixteen feet, enhanced by writable surfaces for greater interactivity and a more creative and graphic external skin. The third Cube came together in 2013. It featured a more complex and compelling multi-level architectural design with a pillared facade, more surfaces for writing and drawing, a tapestry wall, colored strobes and spotlights, and giant painted murals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/nov/20/joe-downtown-why-giant-burning-cube-can-change-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Life Cube at Downtown Las Vegas==
In 2013, artist Scott Cohen was invited by the Downtown Project to develop the Life Cube Project for [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109184755/https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, a Life Cube was constructed on an entire city block in the East Fremont district of downtown Las Vegas. Open to the public 24/7,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/as-we-see-it/2014/feb/05/burning-man-inspired-life-cube-downtown-las-vegas/&lt;/ref&gt; local artists and members of the community painted all of its surfaces. The Life Cube was covered in constantly evolving and overlapping murals, hosting handwritten and painted messages from its visitors who wrote their personal hopes and dreams on "wish-stick" postcards and dropped them inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/feb/04/burn-downtowns-life-cube-inviting-canvas-artists/&lt;/ref&gt; Locally owned shops, bars, and restaurants joined with the Gay and Lesbian Community Center, churches, and Las Vegas’ City Hall in the project’s goal-setting theme to their constituencies through the satellite cube program.&lt;ref&gt;http://virtual-rebel.com/2014/03/17/life-cube-set-to-burn-in-downtown-festival/&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of March 21, the Cube burned in a ceremony involving thousands of participants and viewers.

The Life Cube returned to downtown Las Vegas in March 2016 and burned on April 2, 2016 in yet another celebration.

==Other Installations==
In 2015, a non-burning metal and glass Life Cube was featured at the Reno Sculpture Fest. The 12’ sculpture included murals, Tapestry Walls, and art and wishes contributed by 1,000s of schoolchildren with outreach to prison inmates, recovering addicts, and challenged youth. Unlike previous Cubes, where "Wish-Stick" postcards were placed inside and burned, this Cube featured a Wish-Tag Wall, where participants wrote on colorful tags tied to the Cube for others to read.

The Life Cube was also featured in Yerington, NV in 2015 for a non-burning installation created specifically for the Mason Valley Boys and Girls Club. This installation included a Tapestry Wall consisting of 1,500 8′ by 8′ canvas panels and a Wish-Tag Wall created by students, teachers, staff, and volunteers from nine middle schools and high schools in the area. During this installation, artist Scott Cohen was also invited to speak at the Youth of the Year banquet &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgj.com/story/news/local/mason-valley/2016/01/20/artist-speak-youth-year-banquet/79080302/?hootPostID=86e7c732a3c0ca201c3fcfd53d7758b1&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage students to follow their hopes, wishes, and dreams.

In October 2016, the Life Cube Project was featured in its first New York installation at the Riverdale School &lt;ref&gt;http://www.riverdale.edu/page.cfm?p=917&amp;newsid=369&amp;ncat=7,11,10,6,8,1,2,5,4,3&lt;/ref&gt; in Bronx, NY. The 12' Cube remained on Jones Lawn for over a week inviting students, parents, faculty, and other visitors to paint, draw, write, and collaborate. This Cube did not burn, but the evolving and inspiring art on the structure invited dozens of participants nonetheless.

The Life Cube Project was invited to El Paso, TX from October 6 - 8, 2017 for the 10th anniversary of the annual Chalk the Block arts festival, organized by the City of El Paso Museum and Cultural Affairs Department (MCAD). The artist, Scott Cohen, spent ten days leading up to the installation visiting over 20 local schools to talk to students about goal-setting and connecting art with community. He spoke to youth from military families at Fort Bliss as well as folks at Opportunity house, a local shelter. Following these artist talks and workshops, the 12' x 12' brushed metal and canvas Life Cube installation was erected on San Jacinto Square, in the heart of the Arts District of downtown El Paso, and was open to the general public for three days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theprospectordaily.com/2017/10/09/chalk-the-block-celebrates-ten-years-with-largest-attendance/&lt;/ref&gt; The Life Cube for Chalk the Block El Paso included all the elements of its signature approach to connecting art and community: live-painting of murals by several local artists, Dream Tags, a Tapestry Wall featuring canvases created by thousands of El Paso students, and—of course—chalk.

==Satellite Cubes==
Designed and implemented expressly for the Las Vegas Life Cube Project, nearly one hundred four-foot cubes were distributed to various venues where they were decorated by local artists, teachers, and children of all ages in establishments and schools throughout the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccsd.net/district/news/schools/2014/mar/7/scott-es-among-schools-to-participate-in-life-cube-project&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite cubes were gathered and returned to the Life Cube site for the final burn, combining their accumulated wishes with those of the Life Cube.

==Burning the Life Cube==
The burn usually takes place as a closing ceremony for the Life Cube. The Las Vegas Cubes required the assistance and support of the [[Las Vegas Fire &amp; Rescue|Las Vegas Fire Department]], an expert burn master, a burn perimeter team, a plethora of municipal permits, event organizers, a traffic plan, engineering, fire safety and air quality reports, cleanup crews, and additional provisions for security, hygiene, and disposal.

'''Mass wasting''', also known as '''slope movement''' or '''mass movement''', is the [[geomorphology|geomorphic]] process by which [[soil]], [[sand]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope typically as a solid, continuous or discontinuous mass, largely under the force of [[gravity]], but frequently with characteristics of a flow as in [[debris flow]]s and [[mudflow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368257/mass-movement Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Types of mass wasting include [[Downhill creep|creep]], slides, flows, topples, and falls, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass wasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and the amount of [[internal friction]] between material help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as the slope's [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without losing its stability is known as its [[angle of repose]]. When a slope made of loose material possesses this angle, its shear strength perfectly counterbalances the force of gravity acting upon it.

Mass wasting may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface. It may also occur at very high speed, such as in [[rockslide]]s or [[landslides]], with disastrous consequences, both immediate and delayed, e.g., resulting from the formation of [[landslide dam]]s.

Factors that change the potential of mass wasting include: change in slope angle, weakening of material by [[weathering]], increased water content; changes in [[vegetation]] cover, and overloading.

Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting. This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes. It is seen on submarine as well as surface volcanoes: [[Loihi]] in the Hawaiian volcanic chain and [[Kick 'em Jenny]] in the Caribbean volcanic arc are two submarine volcanoes that are known to undergo mass wasting. The failure of the northern flank of [[Mount St Helens]] in 1980 showed how rapidly volcanic flanks can deform and fail.

==The importance of water in mass wasting==
Water can increase or decrease the stability of a slope depending on the amount present.  Small amounts of water can strengthen soils because the surface tension of water increases soil cohesion.  This allows the soil to resist erosion better than if it were dry.  If too much water is present the water may act to increase the pore pressure, reducing friction, and accelerating the erosion process and resulting in different types of mass wasting (i.e. mudflows, landslides, etc.).  A good example of this is to think of a [[sand castle]].  Water must be mixed with sand in order for the castle to keep its shape.  If too much water is added the sand washes away, if not enough water is added the sand falls and cannot keep its shape. Water also increases the mass of the soil, this is important because an increase in mass means that there will be an increase in velocity if mass wasting is triggered.
Saturated water, however, eases the process of mass wasting in that the rock and soil debris are easily washed down-slope.

==Types of mass wasting==
Based on how the soil, regolith or rock moves downslope as a whole, mass movements can be broadly classified as creeps and landslides.

===Creeps===
[[Soil creep]] is a slow and long term mass movement. The combination of small movements of soil or rock in different directions over time are directed by gravity gradually downslope. The steeper the slope, the faster the creep. The creep makes trees and shrubs curve to maintain their perpendicularity, and they can trigger landslides if they lose their root footing. The surface soil can migrate under the influence of cycles of freezing and thawing, or hot and cold temperatures, inching its way towards the bottom of the slope forming [[terracettes]].  

===Landslides===
A [[landslide]], also called a landslip, is a slow or rapid movement of a large mass of earth and rocks down a hill or a mountainside. Little or no flowage of the materials occurs on a given slope until heavy rain and resultant lubrication by the same rainwater facilitate the movement of the materials, causing a landslide to occur. 

In particular, if the main feature of the movement is a slide along a planar or curved surface, the landslide is termed slump, earth slide, debris slide or rock slide, depending on the prevailing material.

Movement of soil and regolith that more resembles fluid behavior is called a flow. These include [[avalanche]]s, [[mudflow]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[earth flow]], [[lahars]] and [[sturzstrom]]s. Water, air and ice are often involved in enabling fluid-like motion of the material.

A fall, including [[rockfall]] and debris fall, occurs where regolith cascades down a slope, but is not of sufficient volume or viscosity to behave as a flow. Falls are promoted in rocks which are characterized by the presence of vertical cracks. Falls can also result from undercutting by running water as well as by waves. They usually occur at very steep slopes such as a cliff face. The rock material may be loosened by earthquakes, rain, plant-root wedging, and expanding ice, among other things. The accumulation of rock material that has fallen and resides at the base of the structure is known as [[Scree|talus]].

==Triggers of mass wasting==
Soil and regolith remain on a hillslope only while the gravitational forces are unable to overcome the frictional forces keeping the material in place (see [[slope stability]]). Some factors that reduce the frictional resistance relative to the downslope forces, and thus can trigger slope movement, can include:
* [[earthquake]]s
* increased overburden from structures
* increased soil moisture
* reduction of roots holding the soil to bedrock
* undercutting of the slope by [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] or erosion
* weathering by [[frost heave]] or chemical dissolution
* [[bioturbation]]

==Reducing the impacts of mass wasting==
* [[Afforestation]]
* Re-Afforestation
* [[Terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] steps on slopes or, more generally, re-modeling its shape
* [[Slope stabilization]]

The '''Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry''' (MPIB) is a research institute of the [[Max Planck Society]] located in [[Martinsried]], a suburb of [[Munich]]. The Institute was "founded in 1973 by the merger of three formerly independent institutes: the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, the Max Planck Institute of Protein and Leather Research (founded 1954 in [[Regensburg]]), and the Max Planck Institute of Cell Chemistry (founded 1956 in [[Munich]])."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/institute/index.html Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

With 850 employees in currently eight research departments and about 25 research groups, the MPIB is one of the largest biologically-medically oriented institutes of the Max Planck Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/news/ueber_das_institut About the MPIB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

'''The Media Practice Model''' is a media effects model used within the area of [[mass communication]].  This model was developed by '''Jeanne R. Steele''' and '''Jane D. Brown''' in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of [[media consumption]]. This [[theoretical]] framework was developed to better understand what drives [[teenagers]] to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the [[dialectical]] aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents’ individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J.R., &amp; Brown, J.D. (1995). Adolescent room culture: Studying media in the context of everyday life. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24(5), 551.  Retrieved November 30, 2010, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 12036417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily [[newspaper|journals]], in-depth [[interviews]], self-administered [[questionnaires]] and “room touring” to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents’ “room [[culture]].” This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents’ bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. Am. Psychol. 41: 954-969&lt;/ref&gt; The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as [[Selective Exposure Theory]], [[Uses and Gratifications]], [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], [[Cultivation theory]], and Emotional Conditioning.

== Components ==

The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, [[interaction]] and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one’s [[Identity formation|identity]] and lived experience. [[Identity formation]] is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents’ sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of [[cultural]] production and reproduction. The [[theoretical]] perspective of “'''lived through experience'''” ([[Vygotsky]], 1978),&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes. In M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (Eds.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage]], the [[sociocultural]] differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as [[religious beliefs]], interactions within one’s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of “lived experience” emphasizes the idea that adolescents’ interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of “lived experience (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).” 
	

'''Selection''', within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by [[motivation]]s, which in turn affects [[attention]] to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] and [[uses and gratifications theory]]. This means that a teenager’s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on [[affective]], [[behavioral]], [[cognitive]] and [[Instrumental value|instrumental]] needs, or it could also simply be a result of [[habituation]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in “lived experience”, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her [[ethnic heritage]]. 
	

'''Interaction''' is defined as the [[cognitive]], [[affective]], and [[behavioral]] engagement with the media that produces [[cultural]] meanings, which are affected by adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.

:''Evaluation'' and ''interpretation'' of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of [[identity formation]]. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).

The concept of “lived experience” was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, [[racial]] understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.

'''Application''' is defined as the [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.

:''Appropriation'' is an active, [[intentional]], easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. ''Incorporation'', on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens [[unconsciously]]. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the [[self]], building on already existing [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[feeling]]s and [[knowledge]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.

== Development ==
	
Based on reviewers’ critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as “teens’ practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).” This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as [[hard rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (Steele, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J. (1999). Teenage Sexuality and Media Practice: Factoring in the Influences of Family, Friends, and School (Book). Journal of Sex Research, 36(4), 331-341. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele’s (1999) study also provided more depth to the “lived experience” component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one’s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on [[Content (media)|media content]] or [[media effects]].

Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66270">{{Politics}}
The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B.

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G. Lansdale and the Folksongs of Americans in the Vietnam War|journal=American Folklore|year=1989|volume=102|pages=390–411|jstor=541780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock music==

The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

===Rock the Vote===
[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php |title=About Rock the Vote |website=Rockthevote.com |date=1993-02-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to "build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120930064408/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F12-19-2007%2F0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007%2C+09%3A00+AM ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade hip hop band [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] became "perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group"&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2010/06/15/hip-hop-and-politics-have-a-long-history-behind-the-mic/|title=Hip-hop and politics have a long history behind the mic - theGrio|date=15 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a series of records whose message and success "directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as [[X Clan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/x-clan-mn0000585601/biography|title=X Clan - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poor Righteous Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poor-righteous-teachers-mn0000852698/biography|title=Poor Righteous Teachers - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brand Nubian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brand-nubian-mn0000933772/biography|title=Brand Nubian - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG|2 Black 2 Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-black-2-strong-mn0000899479/biography|title=2 Black 2 Strong - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
Racist music or [[white power music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">'''The National Centre for e-Social Science''' (NCeSS) was a [[UK]] based centre which aimed to promote [[e-Social Science]].  It was founded circa 2003 with funding from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) to investigate how innovative and powerful computer-based infrastructure and tools developed over the previous three years under the UK e-Science programme could benefit [[social science]]. The foundation of much of the work was the use of computational infrastructure that was collaboratively provisioned and worked across organisational boundaries. Collaboration was key and the computational approach was commonly known as '[[Grid Computing]]'.

e-Social Science refers to the use of enhanced computer and information technology infrastructure and tools for social science. The role of NCeSS was to investigate specific applications of e-Social Science, develop tools to support them and to advise on the future strategic direction of [[e-Social Science]] and [[e-Science]] more generally. NCeSS also provided information, training, advice, support and on-line resources to help the social science research community adopt e-Social Science approaches. NCeSS developed a portal based e-Infrastructure based on [https://sakaiproject.org/ Sakai] to support e-Social Science, but it was short lived due to lack of resources for sustaining it.

NCeSS was coordinated from the [[University of Manchester]], and involved groups from various other UK universities. The NCeSS research programme included applications of [[e-Science]] in both quantitative and qualitative social sciences, and studies of issues relevant to promoting the wider adoption of [[e-Science]].

NCeSS gradually stopped functioning and the NCeSS Sakai Portal went off line in around 2011.

By 2015, little remains online to indicate that NCeSS ever existed, but the Internet Archive Way Back Machine captured something of the Web Site that once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Nuclear engineering''' is the branch of [[engineering]] concerned with the application of breaking down  [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] ([[nuclear fission|fission]]) or of combining atomic nuclei ([[nuclear fusion|fusion]]),  or with the application of other sub-atomic processes based on the principles of [[nuclear physics]]. In the sub-field of nuclear fission, it particularly includes the design, interaction, and maintenance of systems and components like [[nuclear reactor]]s, [[nuclear power plant]]s, or [[nuclear weapon]]s. The field also includes the study of [[nuclear medicine|medical]] and other applications of [[radiation]], particularly [[Ionizing radiation]], [[nuclear safety]], [[heat|heat/thermodynamics]] transport, [[nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear fuel]], or other related technology (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]]) and the problems of [[nuclear proliferation]].

==Professional areas==
The United States currently generates about 18% of its electricity from nuclear power plants. Nuclear engineers in this field generally work, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry or for [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|national laboratories]]. Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical and [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation-resistant]] reactor designs with passive safety features. Some government (national) labs provide research in the same areas as private industry and in other areas such as [[nuclear fuel]]s and nuclear fuel cycles, [[Generation IV reactor|advanced reactor designs]], and [[nuclear weapon design]] and maintenance. A principal pipeline/source of trained personnel (both military and civilian) for US reactor facilities is the US Navy Nuclear Power Program, including its [[Nuclear Power School]] in South Carolina. Employment in nuclear engineering is predicted to grow about nine percent to year 2022 as needed to replace retiring nuclear engineers, provide maintenance and updating of safety systems in power plants, and to advance the applications of nuclear medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm#tab-6 "Nuclear Engineers – Job Outlook"] in ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014–15''.

===Nuclear medicine and medical physics===
[[Medical physics]] is an important field of nuclear medicine; its sub-fields include [[nuclear medicine]], [[radiation therapy]], [[health physics]], and [[diagnostic imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140725051809/http://aapm.org/medical_physicist/fields.asp Medical Physicist]. ''American Association of Physicists in Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt; Highly specialized and intricately operating equipment, including  [[x-ray machine]]s, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanners and many other devices provide most of modern medicine's diagnostic capability—along with disclosing subtle treatment options. &lt;gallery&gt;

File:PET-image.jpg|'''PET scan taken with an ECAT Exact HR+PET scanner'''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nuclear materials===
Nuclear materials research focuses on two main subject areas, [[nuclear fuel]]s and irradiation-induced modification of nuclear materials. Improvement of nuclear fuels is crucial for obtaining increased efficiency from nuclear reactors. Irradiation effects studies have many purposes, including studying structural changes to reactor components and studying [[Nanotechnology|nano-modification]] of metals using [[Focused ion beam|ion-beams]] or [[particle accelerators]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Radiation protection and measurement===

Radiation measurement is fundamental to the science and practice of [[radiation protection]], sometimes known as radiological protection, which is the protection of people and the environment from the harmful effects of uncontrolled radiation.{{fact|date=December 2017}} 

Nuclear engineers and radiological scientists are interested in developing more advanced [[:Category:Ionising radiation detectors|ionizing radiation measurement and detection]] systems, and using these advances to improve imaging technologies; these areas include detector design, fabrication and analysis, measurements of fundamental atomic and nuclear parameters, and radiation imaging systems, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">In [[rhetoric]], a '''parenthesis''' (plural: ''parentheses''; from the [[Ancient Greek]] word παρένθεσις ''parénthesis'' 'injection, insertion', literally '(a) putting in beside') or '''parenthetical phrase''' is an explanatory or qualifying word, clause, or sentence inserted into a passage. The parenthesis could be left out and still form grammatically correct text.&lt;ref name="Walker1823"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Walker|title=A Rhetorical Grammar: In which the Common Improprieties in Reading and Speaking are Detected ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TsJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=1823|publisher=T. Cadell|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parentheses are usually marked off by round or square [[bracket]]s, dashes, or commas.

==Examples==
;Billy-bob, a great singer, was not a good dancer.:The phrase ''a great singer'', set off by commas, is both an [[appositive]] and a parenthesis.
;A dog (not a cat) is an animal that barks.:The phrase ''not a cat'' is a parenthesis.
;My umbrella (which is somewhat broken) can still shield the two of us from the rain.:The phrase ''which is somewhat broken'' is a parenthesis.
;Please, Gerald, come here!: ''Gerald'' is both a noun of [[direct address]] and a parenthesis.

==Types==
The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.&lt;ref&gt;''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interjection: My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!
*Aside: My father, if you don’t mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.
*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.
*Absolute phrase: My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.
*Free modifier: My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.
*Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.
*Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.

==Punctuation==
While a parenthesis need not be written enclosed by the [[bracket|curved brackets]] called ''parentheses'', their use, principally around rhetorical parentheses, has made the [[punctuation mark]]s the only common use for the term in most contexts.

The [[United Nations]], through its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] per Chapter VII of its [[United Nations Charter|charter]], has the ability to authorize force to enforce its resolutions and ceasefires already created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume=33|pages=198-223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace enforcement differs from [[peacekeeping]] as peace enforcement activities are generally used to create a peace from a broken ceasefire or to enforce a peace demanded by the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Compared to peacekeeping, peace enforcement requires more military force and is thereby best done by heavily armed forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it is generally unable to create lasting peace, as it does nothing to deal with the underlying problems which caused the conflict itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CHAPTER III -- PEACE ENFORCEMENT|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_93-8_chap3.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous examples of peace enforcement was the UN intervention during the [[Gulf War]] to force Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army from Kuwait. The United Nations was thereby able to compel Iraq's compliance with the UN Resolutions which demanded its withdrawal from the region.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on International Relations|last = Nau|first = Henry R|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4522-4148-7|location = Washington DC|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on peacekeeping and peace enforcement in the 1990s for the United States Army established this difference between peace enforcement and peacekeeping: &lt;blockquote&gt;Peacekeeping, a role the U.N. has played over the years, is relatively straightforward and, despite its difficulties, comparatively easy. Peacekeeping involves monitoring and enforcing a cease-fire agreed to by two or more former combatants. It proceeds in an atmosphere where peace exists and where the former combatants minimally prefer peace to continued war. Peace-enforcement, as it is used by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|United States Joint Chiefs of Staff]], entails the physical interposition of armed forces to separate ongoing combatants to create a cease-fire that does not exist. [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Boutros-Ghali]], on the other hand, uses the term to refer to actions to keep a cease-fire from being violated or to reinstate a failed cease-fire. It is a subtle difference, but it does imply the existence of some will for peace. The American version more realistically portrays another, far more difficult matter. By definition, in a situation for which peace-enforcement is a potentially appropriate response, war and not peace describes the situation, and one or more of the combatants prefer it that way. This means that, unlike peacekeepers, peace enforcers are often not welcomed by one or either side(s). Rather, they are active fighters who must impose a cease-fire that is opposed by one or both combatants; in the process, the neutrality that distinguishes peacekeepers will most likely be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub348.pdf |title=Peacekeeping, Peacemaking and Peace-Enforcement: The U.S. Role in the New International Order |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Prehistoric technology''' is [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]], including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, and bury their dead.

There are several factors that made the evolution of prehistoric technology possible or necessary. One of the key factors is [[behavioral modernity]] of the [[Encephalization|highly developed brain]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''  capable of abstract [[reasoning]], [[language]], [[introspection]], and [[problem solving]]. The advent of agriculture resulted in lifestyle changes from nomadic lifestyles to ones lived in homes, with domesticated animals, and land farmed using more varied and sophisticated tools. Art, architecture, music and religion evolved over the course of the prehistoric periods.

=== Stone Age ===
The [[Stone Age]] is a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted roughly 2.5 million years, from the time of early hominids to ''Homo sapiens'' in the later Pleistocene era, and largely ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Stone Age lifestyle was that of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who traveled to hunt game and gather wild plants, with minimal changes in technology. As the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] neared its end (about 12,500 years ago), [[megafauna|large animals]] like the [[mammoth]] and [[bison antiquus]] became extinct and the climate changed.  Humans adapted by maximizing the resources in local environments, gathering and eating a wider range of wild plants and hunting or catching smaller game.  [[Domestication]] of plants and animals with early stages in the [[Old World]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]]) [[Mesolithic]] and New World ([[Americas]]) [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] periods led to significant changes and reliance on agriculture in the Old World [[Neolithic]] and New World [[Formative stage]].  The agricultural life led to more settled existences and significant technological advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). ''The Archaeology of Colorado'', Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 6-14. {{ISBN|1-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|During the [[Paleolithic Age]], [[archaic humans]] had a lifestyle which involved limited use of tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies, then, were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation in this environment.  Fire, stone tools and weapons, and clothing were technological developments of major importance during this period. Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]], and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. A subset of Stone Age humans, including [[Ngaro people|Ngaro Aborigines]], developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to an eastward [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, [[celestial navigation]], and star maps. The early Stone Age is described as [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[Mesolithic]]. The former is generally used to describe the early Stone Age in areas with limited glacial impact. The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]] and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunnelling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming, and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}|group="nb"}}

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|author=|date=|website=news.nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Though concrete evidence is limited, scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and the role technology played in their lives.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==== Lower Paleolithic ====
The [[Lower Paleolithic]] period was the earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million year]]s ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Cultural aspects emerged, such as [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]] period, which included [[cave painting]], [[sculpture]] such as the [[Venus figurines]], carvings and engravings of bone and ivory.  The most common subject matter was large animals that were hunted by the people of the time.

==== Neolithic Revolution ====
The [[Neolithic Revolution]] was the first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] nomadic life to an [[agriculture]] existence.  It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years [[Before Present|BP]] (8,000–5,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]).

=== Bronze Age ===
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|200px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The Stone Age developed into the [[Bronze Age]] after the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Neolithic Revolution involved radical changes in agricultural technology which included [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]], animal [[domestication]], and the adoption of permanent settlements.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The [[Bronze Age]] is characterised by metal [[smelting]] of [[copper]] and its alloy [[bronze]], an alloy of [[tin]] and copper, to create implements and weapons. Polished stone tools continued to be used due to their abundance compared with the less common metals (especially tin).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Iron Age ===

Other societal changes often accompanied the introduction of iron, including practice changes in art, religion and agriculture. The Iron Age ends with the beginning of the historic periods, generally marked by the [[History of writing|development of written language]] that enabled creation of [[Recorded history|historic record]]s.&lt;ref name="TJEB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spoerl /&gt;

The timing of the adoption of iron depended upon "the availability of iron ore and the state of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TJEB" /&gt; Iron was smelted in Egypt about 6000 B.C. and iron replaced bronze in the Middle East about 1500 B.C. Chinese began casting iron about 5000 B.C. and their methods for casting iron was the precursor to modern steel manufacturing methods. Most of Asia, however, did not adopt production of iron until the historic period.&lt;ref name="Kipfer pp. 257-258" /&gt;

{{main|Archaeology of the Americas}}
The New World periods began with the crossing of the [[Paleo-Indians]], [[Athabaskan language|Athabaskan]], [[Aleut]]s and [[Eskimo]]s along the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] onto the North American continent.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. p. 13. {{ISBN|1-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paleo-Indians]]  were the first people who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the [[Americas]] during the final [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial episodes]] of the [[Late Pleistocene|late Pleistocene period]]. Evidence suggests big-game hunters crossed the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia into North America over a land and ice bridge ([[Beringia]]), that existed between 45,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] – 12,000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 "Atlas of the Human Journey-The Genographic Project."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501094643/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |date=2011-05-01 }} National Geographic Society. 1996-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; following herds of large [[herbivores]] far into [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;Viegas, Jennifer. [http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/13/beringia-native-american.html "First Americans Endured 20,000-Year Layover."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010092348/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/13/beringia-native-american.html |date=2012-10-10 }} ''Discovery News.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book, ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology,'' Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips defined five cultural stages for the Americas, including the three prehistoric [[Lithic stage|Lithic]],  [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] and [[Formative stage]]s.  The historic stages are the [[Classic stage|Classic]] and [[Post-Classic stage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1989). Glyn Edmund Daniel and Christopher Chippindale (eds.). ''The Pastmasters: Eleven Modern Pioneers of Archaeology.'' New York: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-05051-1}}. OCLC 19750309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt;

=== Lithic ===
The [[Lithic technology|Lithic]] period occurred from 12,000 to 6,000 years before present and included the [[Clovis culture|Clovis]], [[Folsom tradition|Folsom]] and [[Plano culture]]s.&lt;ref name=Cassells9&gt;Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). ''The Archaeology of Colorado.'' (revised edition). Boulder: Johnson Books. p. 9. {{ISBN|9781-55566-193-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Clovis culture was considered the first culture to use projectile points to hunt on the North American continent. Since then, a [[Manis Mastodon Site|pre-Clovis site was found in Manis, Washington]] that found use of projectile points to hunt mastodons.&lt;ref&gt;Bhanoo, Sindya N. (October 20, 2011). [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25mastodon.html "Big-Game Hunt Adds to Evidence of Early North American Settlement."] ''New York Times.'' Retrieved December 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaic ===

The [[Archaic period in the Americas]] was dated from 8,000 to 2,000 years before present.&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt; People were hunters of small game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gatherers of wild plants, moving seasonally to hunting and gathering sites.  Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 A.D., corn was introduced into the diet and pottery-making became an occupation for storing and caring food.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C&amp;pg=PA341 ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology.''] New York:Plenum Publisher. p. 341. {{ISBN|0-306-46158-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formative ===
The [[Formative stage]] followed the Archaic period in the Americas and continued until there was contact by European people. Some of the cultures from that period include that of the [[Ancient Pueblo People]], [[Mississippian culture]] and [[Olmec]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Cassells9/&gt;

Cultures of the Formative Stage are supposed to possess the technologies of pottery, weaving, and developed food production.  Social organization is supposed to involve permanent towns and villages, as well as the first ceremonial centers.  Ideologically, an early priestly class or theocracy is often present or in development.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips (1957). ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology.''

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

'''Speed reading''' is any of several techniques used to improve one's ability to read quickly. Speed reading methods include [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] and minimizing [[subvocalization]]. The many available speed reading training programs include books, videos, software, and seminars. There is scientific controversy surrounding the domain of speed reading.

== History ==
Psychologists and educational specialists working on [[visual acuity]] used a [[tachistoscope]] to conclude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Behavioral Optometry |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=40 |title= The Tachistoscope Its History &amp; Uses |author=Edward C. Godnig, O.D. |url=http://www.oepf.org/sites/default/files/journals/jbo-volume-14-issue-2/14-2%20Godnig.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that with training, an average person could identify minute images flashed on the screen for only one five-hundredth of a second (2 [[millisecond|ms]]). Though the images used were of airplanes, the results had implications for reading.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed reading fact or fiction|url=http://brainathlete.com/speed-reading-fact-fiction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the late 1950s that a portable, reliable, and convenient device would be developed as a tool for increasing reading speed. [[Evelyn Wood (teacher)|Evelyn Wood]], a researcher and schoolteacher, was committed to understanding why some people were naturally faster at reading and tried to force herself to read very quickly. In 1958, while brushing off the pages of a book she had thrown down in despair, she discovered that the sweeping motion of her hand across the page caught the attention of her eyes, and helped them move more smoothly across the page. She then used the hand as a pacer. Wood first taught the method at the [[University of Utah]], before launching it to the public as Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0wn1I3Q9SQC&amp;pg=PA40|title=The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program|first=Stanley D|last=Frank|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|page=40|isbn=9781566194020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

===Skimming and scanning===
'''Skimming''' is a process of speed reading that involves visually searching the sentences of a page for clues to the main idea or when reading an essay, it can mean reading the beginning and ending for summary information, then optionally the [[Topic sentence|first sentence of each paragraph]] to quickly determine whether to seek still more detail, as determined by the [[SQ3R#Process|questions]] or purpose of the reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2017-08-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some people, this comes naturally, but is usually acquired by practice. Skimming is usually seen more in adults than in children. It is 
conducted at a higher rate (700 words per minute and above) than normal [[reading (activity)|reading]] for comprehension (around 200–230 wpm), and results in lower comprehension rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Just|first1=Marcel Adam|title=Speedreading|url=https://works.bepress.com/marcel_just_cmu/84/|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially with information-rich reading material. '''Scanning''' is the process where one actively looks for information using a [[mind-map]] (organizing information in a visually hierarchical manner that showcases the interrelatedness of the information for better retrievability) formed from skimming. These techniques are used by meta-guiding your eyes. Scanning includes the main point as well as headings and important information.

=== Meta guiding ===
'''Meta guiding''' is the visual guiding of the eye using a finger or pointer, such as a pen, in order for the eye to move faster along the length of a passage of text. It involves drawing invisible shapes on a page of text in order to broaden the visual span for speed reading. For example, an audience of customers at a speed reading seminar will be instructed to use a finger or pen to make these shapes on a page and told that this will speed up their [[visual cortex]], increase their visual span to take in the whole line, and even imprint the information into their subconscious for later retrieval. It has also been claimed to reduce [[subvocalization]] (saying words in your head rather than grasping the idea), thereby speeding up reading. Because this encourages the eye to skim over the text, it can reduce comprehension and memory, and lead to missing important details of the text. An emphasis on [[Saccade|viewing]] each word, albeit briefly without regression (Regression is an unconscious process where the eyes go forward two or three “stops” and then go back.) is required for this method to be effective. E.g. S movement and Z movement{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

Speed reading is a skill honed through practice. Reading a text involves comprehension of the material. In speed reading practice this is done through multiple reading processes: preview, overview, read, review and recite; and by read and recall (recording through writing a short summary or a mental outline) exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Method to Improve Reading Speed | url=https://www.getacademichelp.com/blog/method-to-improve-reading-speed }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important method for better comprehension is the [[SQ3R]] process. These processes help an individual to retain most of the presented ideas from a reading material. A better focus in comprehension is attained through a better reading process with good understanding of the topic.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

== Types of reading ==
Types of reading greatly affect the speed of reading. Each of us is wired differently from environmental influences. Many have learned to read word by word from grade school, and have never been taught or informed the need to improve upon that method. When reading word by word, our eyes often skip back to a previous word or line; we might also fixate on a single word even after it has been read. These mechanical issues slow us down while reading and comprehending.

There are three types of reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Professional skills|url=http://www.materials.ac.uk/guides/developing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mental reading ([[Subvocalization]]): sounding out each word internally, as reading to yourself. This is the slowest form of reading. Many intelligent people read with subvocalization and 250 wpm.
# Auditory reading: hearing out the read words. This is a faster process.
# Visual reading: understanding the meaning of the word, rather than sounding or hearing. This is the fastest process.

Mental readers generally read at approximately 250 words per minute. Auditory readers read at approximately 450 words per minute. Visual readers read at approximately 700 words per minute. Proficient readers are able to read 280 - 310 wpm without compromising comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Speed Reading|url = https://wellness.uchicago.edu/page/speed-reading|website = The University of Chicago Student Health and Counseling Services|access-date = December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on comprehension ==
Skimming alone may not be ideal when complete [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] of the text is the main objective. Skimming is mainly used when researching and getting an overall idea of the text. Nonetheless, when time is limited, skimming or skipping over text can aid comprehension when layered reading is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doug Lemov|author2=Colleen Driggs|author3=Erica Woolway|title=Reading Reconsidered: A Practical Guide to Rigorous Literacy Instruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5YvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=29 February 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-10424-7|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan &amp; Payne (2009) compared skimming with reading normally, given only enough time to read normally through half of a text. They found that the main points of the full text were better understood after skimming (which could view the full text) than after normal reading (which only read half the text). There was no difference between the groups in their understanding of less important information from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Duggan | first1 = GB. | last2 = Payne | first2 = SJ. | title = Text skimming: the process and effectiveness of foraging through text under time pressure | journal = J Exp Psychol Appl | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–42 |date=Sep 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0016995 | pmid = 19751073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, other findings suggest that speed reading courses which teach techniques that largely constitute skimming of written text result in a lower comprehension rate (below 50% comprehension on standardized comprehension tests) (Carver 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carver | first1 = R.P. | title = Reading rate: Theory, research and practical implications. | journal = Journal of Reading | volume = 36 | pages = 84–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanderlinde |first1=William |title=Speed Reading: Fact or Fiction? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehension is considered to be better if the text is skimmed and main key words are underlined before regular reading due to the function of RAS (Reticular Activating System) in the brain. This is the part of the brain that dislikes incomplete information. It aids the reader to find the information close to a topic. For the RAS is activated by the questions and prioritized information, this makes the reader more focused while reading with a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Erlauer|title=The Brain-compatible Classroom: Using what We Know about Learning to Improve Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypVuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=2003|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-0-87120-748-7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arvin Vohra]], in "Introduction to Speed Reading and Rapid Analytical Reading" claims that material structure (close and open forms) based and grammar based reading can lead to a simultaneous increase in speed and comprehension. Just as moving from letter by letter reading in early childhood to word by word reading in later childhood increases speed and comprehension, he argues that reading clause by clause or phrase by phrase can cause a similar increase in speed and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last1 = Vohra | first1 = Arvin | title = Introduction to Speed Reading and Rapid Analytical Reading | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eye-exercise-for-speed-reading thumb.gif|thumb|Eye exercise for speed reading]]

Computer programs are available to help instruct speed reading students. Some programs present the data as a serial stream, since the brain handles text more efficiently by breaking it into such a stream before [[parsing]] and interpreting it. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The 2000 National Reading Panel (NRP) report (p.&amp;nbsp;3-1) seems to support such a mechanism.

To increase speed, some older programs required readers to view the center of the screen while the lines of text around it grew longer. They also presented several objects (instead of text) moving line by line or bouncing around the screen; users had to follow the object(s) with only their eyes. A number of researchers criticize using objects instead of words as an effective training method, claiming that the only way to read faster is to read actual text. Many of the newer speed reading programs use built-in text, and they primarily guide users through the lines of an on-screen book at defined speeds. Often the text is highlighted to indicate where users should focus their eyes; they are not expected to read by pronouncing the words, but instead to read by viewing the words as complete images. The exercises are also intended to train readers to eliminate [[subvocalization]], though it has not been proven that this will increase reading speed.

== Controversies in speed reading ==
Common controversies in speed reading are between its intent and nature with traditional concepts like comprehension vs speed; reading vs skimming; popular psychology vs evidence-based psychology. Much of the controversy is raised over these points. This is mainly because a reading comprehension level of 50% is deemed unusable by some educationalists (Carver 1992). Speed reading advocates claim that it is a great success and even state that it is a demonstration of good comprehension for many purposes ([[Tony Buzan|Buzan]] 2000). The trade-off between "speed" and comprehension must be analyzed with respect to the type of reading that is being done, the risks associated with mis-understanding due to low comprehension, and the benefits associated with getting through the material quickly and gaining information at the actual rate is to be obtained. [[Mark Seidenberg]] considers claims like 25,000 words per minute "cannot be true given basic facts about eyes and texts" and comments that "people are as likely to read thousands of words per minute as they are to run faster than the speed of light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Seidenberg|title=Language at the Speed of Sight: How We Read, Why So Many Can't, and What Can Be Done About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTBnAgAAQBAJ|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amy Carter and Jimmy Carter participate in a speed reading course at the White House. - NARA - 173797.jpg|[[Jimmy Carter]] and his daughter [[Amy Carter|Amy]] participate in a speed reading course.|thumb|right]]
In a 2016 article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|last2=Schotter|first2=Elizabeth R.|last3=Masson|first3=Michael E. J.|last4=Potter|first4=Mary C.|last5=Treiman|first5=Rebecca|date=2016-01-14|title=So Much to Read, So Little Time|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100615623267|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=4–34|doi=10.1177/1529100615623267|issn=1529-1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal of 'Psychological Science in the Public Interest', the authors conclude there is no 'magic bullet' for reading more quickly while maintaining comprehension other than to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g. through increased vocabulary). The authors proceed with debunking common speed reading techniques such as eliminating sub-vocalization, reading more than one word at a time a.k.a. grouping, using [[Rapid serial visual presentation|RSVP]] (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation), increasing peripheral vision, alternating colors for each line of text.

U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was a proponent of speed reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=John F. Kennedy on Leadership | url=http://www.presidentialexpert.com/leadership_john_f_kennedy.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged his staff to take lessons. U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], were both avid readers and enrolled in a speed-reading course at the White House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Experience  | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/gallery/gal_carter_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several staff members. A critical discussion about speed reading stories appeared in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. Among others, the article raises doubts about the origin of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s allegedly amazing reading speed.

Ronald Carver, a professor of education research and psychology, claims that the fastest college graduate readers can only read about 600 words per minute, at most twice as fast as their slowest counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/2000/02/the_1000word_dash.html | title=The 1,000-Word Dash | first = Timothy | last = Noah | authorlink = Timothy Noah | date = Feb 18, 2000 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have suggested that speed reading is actually skimming, not reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Skeptic's Dictionary | url=http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Championship Speed Reading Competition stresses reading comprehension as critical. The top contestants typically read around 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute with approximately 50% comprehension or above. The six time world champion Anne Jones is recorded for 4200wpm with previous exposure to the material and 67% comprehension. The recorded number of words the eye can see in single fixation is three words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vkBywAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy is about "Speed Reading World Record" claims. For example, Howard Stephen Berg from the United States claims to be the Guinness Fastest Reader World Record holder with his reading speed of 25,000 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Howard Berg "World's Fastest Reader" on Good Day Tampa Bay Fox 13  | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilvoigdxhzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such claim comes from Ms. Maria Teresa Calderon from the Philippines. She claims that she earned  the Guinness World Record as the World's Fastest Reader with her 80,000 words per minute reading speed and 100% comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World's fastest reader (80,000 words per minute)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ZLsyXYJWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these announcements were made as Guinness Speed Reading World Records or not, critics point out that con-artists beat these speed reading world records by reading a pre-read or pre-memorized text just by flipping the pages as fast as possible without reading it. The troubling problem is under what criteria these world records were recorded and set. Moreover, the Guinness Speed Reading World Record Standards are not known and they have terminated adding speed readers to its honor list. In 2015, ''Memoriad'', the World Mental Sports Federation, set the rules for "Speed Reading World Record Standards" in order to prevent such unclear claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SPEED READING WORLD RECORD STANDARDS - Memoriad| url=http://www.memoriad.com/index.asp?s=kategoriler&amp;b=kategori-detay&amp;kategoriid=22dcbcd854eaa633da9a3df588bdb010&amp;lang=EN#a39a8d291a0e2db349fe3fc32aa201b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Speed Reading World Record Standards| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8tHsrVvFBc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK National Tide Gauge Network''' is part of the [[National Tidal and Sea Level Facility]]. It was set up in 1953 to record sea levels around the coast of the [[United Kingdom|UK]], after the east coast of England was affected by severe floods.

Gauges positioned at 43 locations around the UK coast record data which is archived at the [[British Oceanographic Data Centre]] in [[Liverpool]]. Once quality controlled, this data is made available for scientific use.

'''USPID''' (''Unione Scienziati per il Disarmo'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is the '''Italian Union of Scientists for Disarmament''', an association established in 1982 with the purpose of providing information about and analysis of arms control and [[disarmament]].

Members of USPID believe that this task is part of the social responsibility of scientists.

The issues addressed by USPID include [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]-control and disarmament, nuclear proliferation, consequences of nuclear explosions, control of fissile material, developments of military technology, conventional disarmament, chemical and biological disarmament, problems of conflicts and conflict resolution.

Members of USPID, both individually and collectively, share their views with Italian policy-makers and opinion-makers.

USPID organizes conferences and meetings, including the biennial Castiglioncello conference (now at its 11th edition), courses and seminars in Italian Universities, courses for high-school teachers.

USPID promotes the establishment of inter-departmental Centers affiliated to Italian Universities, and has actively collaborated for many years with the CIRP-UniBa (Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerche sulla Pace, [[University of Bari]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Universita' di Bari&lt;/ref&gt;

USPID collaborates with international organizations of scientists and other Italian institutions, such as Archivio Disarmo (Roma), Forum per i Problemi della Pace e della Guerra (Firenze). Members of USPID participate in [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] and ISODARCO meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 USPID began a standing collaboration with Landau Network-Centro Volta, Como (Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centro Landau |accessdate=2009-05-20 |url=http://lxmi.mi.infn.it/~landnet/landau.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327215408/http://lxmi.mi.infn.it/~landnet/landau.html |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This institution organizes, together with [[UNESCO]] and under the sponsorship of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, conferences and research projects on different topics, including disarmament, non-proliferation and scientific-technological aspects of International Security.

The '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' ({{lang-sr| Факултет политичких наука Универзитета у Београду / Fakultet političkih nauka Univerziteta u Beogradu}}, abbreviated FPN) is a constituent institution of the [[University of Belgrade]] which focuses on education and research in the fields of political science, international relations, journalism and communication studies, and social policy and social work. It was established in 1968, as a first faculty of this type in former Yugoslavia.

The building, built in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style, is located in the urban neighborhood of [[Voždovac]], close to the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The Faculty of Political Sciences offers [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[PhD]] programmes, as well as advanced professional development programmes.

==History==

The Faculty of Political Sciences was established in 1968, after the National Assembly of Serbia brought an establishment act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/files/sr/univerzitet/glasnik-zakoni/zbornik/knjiga3/3_119.pdf |title=ZAKON O FAKULTETU POLITIČKIH NAUKA U BEOGRADU |language=Serbian |date=1968-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first institution of its kind in [[former Yugoslavia]]. Since its founding to 2013, it has educated more than 8,100 students, with 975 of them having completed [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, and 464 having defended their [[PhD]] theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/the-faculty/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[alumni]] have become recognized experts and scholars, professors and high ranking government officials.

Many of the faculties of political sciences, established subsequently in other parts of the [[former Yugoslavia]] were formed from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences as a core, and a large number of professors at the various faculties of political sciences in all the countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], had obtained their academic titles at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences.

Celebration of the faculty's 40th anniversary was held in the hall of the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] in November 2008. It was sponsored by the President of Serbia. An international conference "State and Democracy" was held as a part of anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%C5%A1tvo/29858/Jubilej++FPN-a.html |title=Jubilej FPN-a |publisher=Radio Television of Serbia |date=2008-11-27 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==

The [[University of Belgrade]] Faculty of Political Sciences has among its academic staff some of the most eminent experts in the field of political sciences, as well as in a range of others ([[economy]], [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[history]], etc.)  Amongst them, there are many widely recognized within the domestic and international academic community, as well as former or current high government officials – Ministers, Ambassadors, etc.

Notable members of the academic staff include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/teachers-and-staff |title=Teachers and Staff |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earl Warren Throckmorton''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bios.marquiswhoswho.com/earl_warren_throckmorton/mental_health_counselor/6347950|title=Earl Warren Throckmorton - mental health counselor - Marquis Who's Who Biography|work=marquiswhoswho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professor of [[Psychology]]  at [[Grove City College]] in [[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/academics/artsandletters/psychology/Pages/Faculty.aspx|title=Faculty|work=gcc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the [[Sexual Identity Therapy Framework]] and was a creator of the documentary ''I Do Exist'', about people who say they have changed their sexual orientation. He is an example of an evangelical Christian who has changed his view about human sexuality, from traditional to more progressive.

== Education ==
Throckmorton received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Psychology]] in June, 1979 from [[Cedarville College]], an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Clinical Psychology]] from [[Central Michigan University]] in May, 1982, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Counselor Education and Community Counseling from [[Ohio University]] in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/webvita.pdf drthrockmorton.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual Identity and the Bible ==
Throckmorton's work on [[Sexual Identity Therapy]] was endorsed by psychiatrist [[Robert L. Spitzer]].&lt;ref name="New Ground"&gt;{{cite news
 |url = http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy

 |date = 2007-06-18
 |accessdate = 2018-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these recommendations is to help patients make their sexual identity conform to their beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|first=Lillian
|last=Kwon
|publisher=Christian Post Reporter
|date=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer later tried to retract his research that endorsed Throckmorton's work by saying "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more."&lt;ref name="My So-Called Ex-Gay Life"&gt;{{cite news
 |url = http://prospect.org/article/my-so-called-ex-gay-life/

 |publisher = [[The American Prospect]]
 |date = 2012-04-11
 |accessdate = 2012-06-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has come out strongly against the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill]]. In turn, former endorsers of his work, such as [[Scott Lively]], have denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2012/08/13/47584|title = Scott Lively: Moral Relativist|author = Rob Tisinai|date = August 13, 2012|publisher = Box Turtle Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has been involved in controversy over the origins and treatment of variations in gender identity. The February 2008 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' carried an article discussing how Throckmorton has advised people who are in agony over being transgender that their desires are not in accord with the Bible.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kennedy, John W. |date=February 2008 |title=The transgender moment; Evangelicals hope to respond with both moral authority and biblical compassion to gender identity disorder |work=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=54–58 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=53605}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even if science does determine differentiation in the brain at birth," Throckmorton says, "even if there are prenatal influences, we can't set aside teachings of the Bible, because of research findings."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"/&gt; Throckmorton subsequently argued that these comments were quoted "out of context". On his blog, he stated that people should consult physicians, specialists, and spiritual advisors in resolving their feelings. If someone decides that sexual reassignment violates faith, then this feeling may guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wthrockmorton.com/2008/02/14/christianity-today-on-the-transgender-moment/ Christianity Today on “The Transgender Moment” — Warren Throckmorton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Jeff Sharlet said that Throckmorton has allowed data and evidence to shape his views "in a way very few people of any ideological or political stripe would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/evangelical-professor-turned-reparative-therapy-gays-174326663.html|title=The evangelical professor who turned against 'reparative therapy' for gays|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article goes on to trace Throckmorton's on-going development of his views on human sexuality and the Bible, which he still believes is divinely inspired. To say it more clearly, Throckmorton has blogged: "After working with LGBT people for two decades, I believe some people are inherently gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2017/11/15/wishful-thinking-and-nashville-statement/|title=Wishful Thinking, Forced Intimacy, and The Nashville Statement|last=Throckmorton|first=Warren|date=2017-11-15|work=Warren Throckmorton|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogging controversies ==
In addition to his writings on sexuality, he has also blogged on various Christian religious organizations involved in controversy, such as:

*[[Mark Driscoll]] and the now-defunct [[Mars Hill Church]] in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/category/mars-hill-church/|title=Mars Hill Church|work=Warren Throckmorton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Chimiques''' ('''ENSIC''') is an Engineering School dedicated to [[Chemical Engineering]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]].

Ensic Nancy is one of the seven schools of the [[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine|Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine]] (INPL), France's largest technological university.
==Creation==
In October 1885, it was announced that the authorities were in favour of the creation of an institute of chemistry in Nancy.  This pulled together a variety of chemical activities in the University of Nancy, with the specific aim of instructing young men in the practical application of chemistry to industry and agriculture. The decree authorizing the creation of the Institute was made on 8 September 1887 and construction began in 1888. The first 6 students joined in 1889 and [[Albin Haller]] was appointed as director on 30 July 1890.  on 6 June 1892 it was formally inaugurated by the President of the Republic, [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]].
&lt;ref name=Labrude&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/pharm_0035-2349_1994_num_82_302_4054  Revue d'histoire de la pharmacie, 82ᵉ année, n°302, 1994. pp. 287-302.] Labrude, Pierre. ''La contribution des pharmaciens à la création (1887-1892) et à l'enseignement de l'Institut Chimique de Nancy. L'influence des systèmes étrangers d'éducation sur cette création.'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Achievements==
