The [[American National Standards Institute]]–Nanotechnology Standards Panel (ANSI-NSP) enables stakeholders in [[nanotechnology]] to work together to coordinate the development of voluntary [[Quality standards|standards]]. Such standards include terminology and materials properties and measurement procedures to facilitate commercialization of applications and uses of nanotechnology. ANSI established the panel in August 2004, and membership is open to all parties interested in nanotechnology standards.

==Objectives==
Objectives of the ANSI-NSP include:

*Providing a forum to define needs, determine work plans and establish priorities for updating standards or creating new standards.
*Soliciting participation from sectors that have not traditionally participated in the voluntary standards system.
*Facilitating the development and adoption of standards in the area of nanotechnology in general and nomenclature/terminology specifically.
*Making available the results of the panel’s work.

[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|[[Orange-thighed frog]]s (''[[Litoria xanthomera]]'') in amplexus]]
'''Amplexus''' (Latin "embrace") is a type of mating behavior exhibited by some [[External fertilization|externally fertilizing]] species (chiefly [[amphibian]]s and [[horseshoe crabs]]) in which a male grasps a female with his front legs as part of the mating process, and at the same time or with some time delay, he [[fertilize]]s the eggs as they are released from the female's body. In amphibians, females may be grasped by the head, waist, or armpits, and the type of amplexus is characteristic of some taxonomic groups. Amplexus involves direct contact between male and female, distinguished from other forms of external fertilization such as [[broadcast spawning]], where sperm and eggs are freely shed into water without direct contact by individuals. 

==Amphibians==
[[File:Amplexus Bufo bufo 2010-03-29.jpg|thumb|European [[common  toad]] (''[[Bufo bufo]]'').]]
[[File:Common toad Bufo bufo multiple amplexus mating ball.jpg|thumb|[[Common toad]] mating ball (multiple amplexus).]]
[[File:Red-eyed tree frogs mating.JPG|thumb|[[Red-eyed tree frog]] (''[[Agalychnis callidryas]]''), [[Costa Rica]]]]
===Anurans===
Amplexus chiefly occurs aquatically, but some more terrestrial [[Frog|anurans]] (frogs and toads) like the [[disc-tongued frog]]s ([[Discoglossidae]]) perform amplexus on land. In crown-group anurans like the true frogs ([[Ranidae]]), the [[tree frog]]s (Hylidae), and the true toads ([[Bufonidae]]), amplexus is axillary (in the armpits). Other anurans (the [[Archaeobatrachia]], [[Sooglossidae]] and [[Myobatrachidae]]), show the ancestral state which is inguinal or lumbar amplexus (abdominal, in front of the hindlegs). Some species show cephalic amplexus where the head of the female is held while others show complete lack of amplexus.&lt;ref name=Duellman&amp;Trueb/&gt;

In most anurans, the males deposit sperm onto the eggs as they are being laid, however males of the genus ''[[Ascaphus]]'' possess an [[intromittent organ]], unique among anurans, for internal fertilization.  Internal fertilization does occur in a few other genera, including ''[[Nectophrynoides]]'', ''[[Mertensophryne]]'', and ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]''.&lt;ref name=Duellman&amp;Trueb&gt;Duellman, W. E. and L. Trueb. 1986. Biology of Amphibians. New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzey, D. 2001. Vertebrate Biology, McGraw Hill Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newts===
In the case of [[newt]]s the process of amplexus is often observed soon after the newts become seasonally active. In the western USA, for example, this time is typically soon after the onset of the winter rainy season, when [[intermittent stream]]s and [[vernal pools]] become available as breeding habitat.  The [[rough-skinned newt]] is a specific widespread example of a newt in the western USA that can be observed in quiet stream pools and shallow ponds engaging in amplexus.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182 Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527153302/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182 |date=2009-05-27 }}'', Globaltwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Horseshoe crabs==
[[File:Limulus polyphemus1.jpg|thumb|right|Amplectant pair of ''[[Limulus polyphemus]]''. The male is the smaller individual.]]
Amplexus occurs in all  four species of [[horseshoe crab]]. The first pair of walking legs is used to tightly clasp the female in all species, and the second pair is also employed in all but ''[[Limulus polyphemus]]''.&lt;ref name=Bottonetal1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Botton|first=Mark L.|author2=Shuster, Carl N.|author3= Sekiguchi, Koichi|author4= Sugita, Hiroaki|title=Amplexus and Mating Behavior in the Japanese Horseshoe Crab,'' Tachypleus tridentatus''|journal=Zoological Science|date=February 1996|volume=13|issue=1|pages=151–159|doi=10.2108/zsj.13.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Anthropotheism}}
'''Anthropopathism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄνθρωπος ''anthropos'', "human" and πάθος ''pathos'', "suffering") is the attribution of human [[emotion]]s, or the ascription of [[human]] [[feeling]]s or [[passions]] to a non-[[human being]], generally to a [[deity]].

By comparison, the term [[anthropomorphism]] originally referred to the attribution of human form to a non-human being, but in modern usage anthropomorphism has come to encompass both meanings.

==Religion==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
This is a technique prevalent in religious writings, where, for instance, [[human]] [[emotion]] is attributed to [[God]], where he would not normally experience emotion in this sense.
This technique is particularly notable in the book of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]], as an example of the theme of God as a [[personal god]]. Some Bible scholars, however, argue that human emotions ascribed to God are indicative of divine responses within the matrix of human history that are in fact analogous to human emotions though not univocal.

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
{{Bengalis}} 

'''Architecture of Bangladesh''' refers to the architectural attributes and styles of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="bangla"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51736/Bangladesh/277578/Visual-art-and-architecture
|title=Visual art and architecture in Bangladesh
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica
|accessdate=6 September 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of Bangladesh has a long history and is rooted in Bangladesh's [[Culture of Bangladesh|culture]], [[Religion in Bangladesh|religion]] and [[History of Bangladesh|history]].&lt;ref name="banglapedia"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture
|title=Architecture
|publisher=Banglapedia
|accessdate=6 September 2009
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved over centuries and assimilated influences from social, religious and exotic communities. The architecture of Bangladesh bears a remarkable impact on the lifestyle, tradition and cultural life of [[Bangladeshi people]]. Bangladesh has many architectural relics and monuments dating back thousands of years.

==Pala Buddhist architecture==
[[File:Naqi model.jpg|thumb|250px|left|8th-century monastery [[Somapura Mahavihara]]]] 
The [[Pala Empire]] was an early Indian empire of Bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] dynasty ruling from Bengal (which included present day [[Bangladesh]]) from the 8th to the 12th centuries. The Palas created a distinctive form of Bengali architecture and art known as the "Pala School of Sculptural Art." The gigantic structures of Vikramashila Vihar, Odantpuri Vihar, and Jagaddal Vihar were masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were destroyed by the forces of the infamous [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Somapura Mahavihara]], a creation of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]], at Paharpur, Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a "pleasure to the eyes of the world." [[UNESCO]] made it a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985. The Pala architectural style was followed throughout south-eastern Asia and China, Japan, and [[Tibet]]. Bengal rightfully earned the name "Mistress of the East". Dr. [[Stella Kramrisch]] says: "The art of Bihar and Bengal exercised a lasting influence on that of [[Nepal]], Burma, [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and [[Java]]." Dhiman and Vittpala were two celebrated Pala sculptors. About Somapura Mahavihara, Mr. J.C. French says with grief: "For the research of the [[Pyramid]]s of [[Egypt]] we spend millions of dollars every year. But had we spent only one percent of that money for the excavation of Somapura Mahavihara, who knows what extraordinary discoveries could have been made".&lt;ref&gt;The Art of the Pala Empire or Bengal, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic and Mughal architecture ==

The Sultanate of Bengal was an era of the Central Asian origin Muslim Nawab dynasty that ruled independently of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1342 to 1576. Most of the Muslim architecture of the period is found in the historic [[Gaur region]], today's [[Rajshahi division]] and [[Malda district]] in [[West Bengal]]. The architecture of the period is noted for the development of a uniquely local style influenced by Bengali architectural traditions. [[Bengal Sultanate|Sultanate]] architecture is exemplified in structures such as the [[Sixty Dome Mosque|Shat Gombuj Masjid]], the [[Sona Mosque|Shona Masjid]] and the [[Kusumba Mosque|Kusumba Masjid]].&lt;ref&gt; http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/4129/original/dpt0826.pdf?1384779803&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1576, much of Bengal came under the control of the [[Mughal Empire]]. At the time, Dhaka emerged as Mughal military base. The development of townships and housing had resulted in a significant growth in population, as the town was proclaimed by [[Subahdar]] [[Islam Khan I]] as capital of [[Bengal Subah]] in 1608, during this time many mosques and forts had been built. [[Bara Katra]] was built between 1644 and 1646 CE to be the official residence of Mughal prince [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]], the second son of emperor [[Shah Jahan]].

Indian Mughal architecture in present-day Bangladesh reached its peak during the reign of [[Subedar]]
[[Shaista Khan]], who encouraged the construction of modern townships and public works in Dhaka, leading to a massive urban and economic expansion. He was a patron of the arts and encouraged the construction of majestic monuments across the province, including [[mosque]]s, [[mausoleum]]s and palaces that represented the finest in [[Mughal architecture]]. Khan greatly expanded [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also Fort Aurangabad), [[Chawk Mosque|Chowk Bazaar Mosque]], [[Saat Masjid]] and [[Choto Katra]]. He also supervised the construction of the mausoleum for his daughter Bibi Pari.

==Terracotta temple architecture==
Much of the terracotta temple architecture in Bangladesh dates to the late Islamic period and early British period during which wealthy Hindu zamindars commissioned these structures.
* Temple architecture styles:
**[[ek-bangla]], have a curved roof with two sloping sides
**[[Jor-bangla]], has a roof of the ek-bangla (or do-chala) style, with two curved segments that meet at a curved ridge
**[[ek-chala]], single-story or has a second story built into a sloping roof
**[[Do-chala]], have a curved roof with two sloping sides
**[[Char-chala]],  have a curved roof composed of four triangular segments
**[[At-chala]], base structure is similar to the four-sided char-chala temple style, but with a small replica of the base temple on top
**[[Deul]], were generally smaller and included features influenced by Islamic architecture
**[[Ek-ratna]], base structure is similar to the four-sided char-chala temple style, but the roof is quite different, flat with a tower in the centre. 
**[[Pancharatna (architecture)|Pancharatna]], has five pavilions or towers on the roof; four stand at the corners of the main level, and one above.
**[[Navaratna (architecture)|Navaratna]], incorporates two main levels, each with four spired corner pavilions, and a central pavilion above, for a total of nine spires.

== Common Bungalow Style Architecture ==
[[File:Village in Pirojpur.jpg|thumb|Village in a clearing Sundarbans, by Frederic Peter Layard, January 1839]]
The origin of the [[bungalow]] has its roots in the historical [[Bengal Presidency|Province of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proz.com/kudoz/english/education_pedagogy/700411-bungalow.html|title=bungalow|work=proz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''baṅgalo'', meaning  "[[Bengal]]i" and used [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptically]] for a "house in the [[Bengal]] style".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "bungalow"; [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bungalow&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Such houses were traditionally small, only one storey and detached, and had a wide [[veranda]] were adapted by the British, who used them as houses for colonial administrators in summer retreats in the Himalayas and in compounds outside Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/B0551200.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308171939/http://www.bartleby.com/61/12/B0551200.html|title=bungalow. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.|archivedate=8 March 2008|work=bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bungalow style houses are still very popular in the rural Bengal. In the rural areas of Bangladesh, it is often called ''Bangla Ghar'' (Bengali Style House). The main construction material used in modern time is corrugated steel sheets. Previously they had been constructed from wood, bamboo and a kind of straw called ''Khar''. Khar was used in the roof of the Bungalow house and kept the house cold during hot summer days. Another roofing material for Bungalow houses has been red clay tiles.

==Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture==
In the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the Indo-European style developed, from a mixture of mainly Indian, European and Central Asian (Islamic) components. Amongst the more prominent works are [[Ahsan Manzil]] in [[Dhaka]] and [[Tajhat Palace]] in [[Rangpur City]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern Bangladeshi Architecture==
In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural attributes, aesthetic and technologically advanced aspects. Since the [[Independence of Bangladesh|inception of Bangladesh]], economical advancement has boosted the architecture from its traditional forms to contemporary context. With the growing urbanization and modernization, the architectural form is turning into modernity covering a wide range of its heritage and tradition.&lt;ref name="banglapedia"/&gt; The architecture of Bangladesh can provide insight into the history and lives of the Bangladeshi people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/|title=Appealing Architecture – From Ancient Treasures to Contemporary Landmarks|accessdate=28 December 2009 |publisher=Bangladesh.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033246/http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/| archivedate= 8 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">The '''Austrian Studies Association''' or '''ASA''' (formerly the Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association or MALCA, with its journal ''Modern Austrian Literature'') continues traditions started in 1961 (originally the International [[Arthur Schnitzler]] Research Association), as the only North American association devoted to scholarship on all aspects of [[Austria]]n and Austrian-associated cultural life and history from the eighteenth century to the present.

The Association publishes a quarterly scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Austrian Studies'' and holds an international annual spring conference, organized around a theme with open sessions. Its other activities include organizing scholarly panels for the annual conventions of the [[Modern Language Association]], the [[German Studies Association]], and at other national and international conferences. Current news and resources of interest are included on its website and distributed through its list-serv and on its [[Facebook]] page.

== Recent history ==
From 1971 through 1999, prior to its incarnation as the Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association in 2000, the journal ''Modern Austrian Literature'' hosted annual conferences at the [[University of California, Riverside]] (UCR) under the auspices of editor and UCR German Studies professor/chair [[Donald G. Daviau]] and secretary-treasurer Jorun Johns ([[California State University, San Bernardino]]), publisher of [[Ariadne Press]], the California-based scholarly publication house for Austrian critical studies and works in translation. The ASA originated in a referendum held in early 2011, when MALCA's membership voted to change the Association's name and to retitle its journal as the ''Journal of Austrian Studies''. These changes acknowledge what has long been the Association's identity: an interdisciplinary organization that welcomes all eras and disciplines of Austrian studies at its conferences and in its journal, including scholarship on the cultures of Austria's earlier political forms ([[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]) and scholarship that acknowledges this region's historical multi-ethnic, multilingual, and transcultural identities and their legacies in the present. {{as of|2010|January|1}}, the ASA/MALCA also assumed the role heretofore played by the American [[Grillparzer]] Society as liaison to the Austrian Grillparzer Gesellschaft, located in [[Vienna]] and the sponsor of conferences and a yearbook. The revision of the association and its publication was initiated by former Presidents David Luft ([[Oregon State University]]) (2010–12) and [[Robert Dassanowsky]] ([[University of Colorado, Colorado Springs]]) (2012–14). The current President of the ASA (2018–20) is Gregor Thuswaldner ([[North Park University]]), Business and Information Manager is Katherine Arens ([[University of Texas, Austin]]).

== Honorary Members==
{{as of|2014}}, the ASA has granted honorary membership to the following prominent Austrian artistic and cultural figures as well as museum directors: [[Ruth Beckermann]], [[Valie Export]], [[Lilian Faschinger]], [[Paul Harather]], [[Josef Haslinger]], [[Peter Henisch]], [[Agnes Husslein-Arco]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Barbara Neuwirth]], [[Hans Raimund]], [[Goetz Spielmann]], [[Peter Rosei]], [[Peter Tscherkassky]], [[Matti Bunzl]], [[Michael Loebenstein]], [[Christoph Thun-Hohenstein]].

== Recent Conferences==
MALCA/ASA conferences have been held at the following venues since the turn of century: 1999 and 2001: [[Lafayette College]], Easton, PA; 2002: [[University of Pennsylvania]], Philadelphia, PA; 2004: [[Rice University]], Houston, TX; 2005: [[University of Montana, Missoula]], MT; 2006: [[Wake Forest University]], Winston-Salem, NC; 2007: [[University of Alberta, Edmonton]], [[Canada]]; 2008: [[University of Washington, Seattle]], WA; 2009: [[Emory University]], Atlanta, GA; 2010: [[University of Vienna]], [[Austria]]; 2011: [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]], Washington, PA; 2012: [[California State University, Long Beach]], CA; 2013: [[University of Waterloo]], [[Canada]]; 2014: AT&amp;T Conference Center and [[University of Texas, Austin]], TX; 2015: [[University of Michigan, Dearborn]], MI; 2016: [[University of Vienna]]/Elfriede Jelinek Research Center, [[Vienna]], Austria; 2017: [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]; 2018: [[University of Vermont]], Burlington, VT; 2019: [[Bowling Green State University]], Ohio.

The Jutta Landa Travel Fund (named after Austrian scholar Jutta Landa McLaughlin, 1945-2003, [[University of California, Los Angeles]]) and the [[Austrian Cultural Forum New York]] supports graduate students who are presenting papers at the Association's annual symposium by assisting with travel costs.

== ''Journal of Austrian Studies'' ==
The ''Journal of Austrian Studies'', produced and distributed by the [[University of Nebraska Press]] is an interdisciplinary quarterly that publishes scholarly articles and book reviews on all aspects of the history and culture of Austria and the former [[Habsburg]] territories. It is the flagship publication of the Austrian Studies Association and contains contributions in German and English from the world's premiere scholars in the field of Austrian studies. The journal highlights scholarly work that draws on innovative methodologies and new ways of viewing Austrian history and culture. Although the journal was renamed in 2012 to reflect the increasing scope and diversity of its scholarship, it has a long lineage dating back over a half century as ''Modern Austrian Literature'' and, prior to that, ''The Journal of the International Arthur Schnitzler Research Association''. {{as of|2012}}, its editors are Todd Herzog ([[University of Cincinnati]]) and Hillary Hope Herzog ([[University of Kentucky]]); book review editor is Joseph W. Moser ([[West Chester University]]), and the editorial board includes prominent Austrianists and Germanists from the U.S., UK, Canada, Austria, and Germany representing a variety of area studies. The [[Max Kade]] Foundation funds an annual Max Kade Prize for Best Article published in the journal, awarded at the conference of the ASA. The winner of the $1500 award is identified from among the articles published in the journal that year, based on a poll of the editorial board.

The '''Board of Architectural Education''' is no longer appointed.  It had been a [[statutory body]] in the [[United Kingdom]] constituted under section 5 of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931.

The Act was citable with two amending Acts as the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. Further amendments and changes enacted by the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]] included abolition of the statutory '''Board of Architectural Education'''.

==Nomination and appointment to the Board==

Subsection 5(1) of the 1931 Act had required the Board of Architecturaql Education to be appointed annually by the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) ("the Council").  The Board was to be constituted in accordance with the Second Schedule of the Act.  This included:

* one person nominated by the [[Liverpool University|Liverpool School of Architecture]] and the nine other [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] named in the Schedule;
* four persons nominated jointly by the Department of Architecture in the [[University of Cambridge]] and the eight other Schools of Architecture named in the Schedule;
* the Director of Education of the School of Architecture of the [[Architectural Association]] in [[London]];
* a total of 14 persons nominated by various other educational bodies, and
* 24 registered persons nominated by the Council.

==The Board's duty==

Subsection 5(2) of the 1931 Act had made it the duty of the Board (of Architectural Education) to recommend to the Council:

* the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to qualify persons for registration in the Register of Registered Architects, and
* the holding of any examinations in architecture which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to be passed by applicants for registration.

==Statutory nomenclature==

The amendments to the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]] which were made by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 included the abolition of the statutory Board of Architectural Education and renaming the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] as the [[Architects Registration Board]].  The Board of Architectural Education is not mentioned in the [[Architects Act 1997]], which consolidated and replaced the Acts of 1931 to 1938, as amended by the Act of 1996.

By section 26, "the Board" in the Architects Act 1997 was henceforth to mean the registration body renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB), which had previously been named the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK).

'''CISV International''' (''Formerly'' '''''Children's International Summer Villages''''') was founded in 1951&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/about-cisv-int/founder/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]] and aims to educate and inspire action for a more just and peaceful world.

The organisation operates international educational programmes on an annual basis to bring together participants from member countries. CISV also operates in smaller communities through its around 200 local Chapters in 69 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisv.org/mycisv/national-chapter-officials-directory/about-us/our-world/|title="Our World"|last=|first=|date=1 March 2017|website=CISV International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV International is a [[UNESCO]] partner Non Governmental Organization (NGO), holds participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]] and is a candidate member of the [[European Youth Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/our-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CISV was founded in 1951, after [[World War II]], by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]]. Since then, the organisation has expanded into around 69 countries, and over 150,000 delegates have participated in more than four thousand international CISV activities that delegates have made up over the course of these years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

For Dr. Allen and the CISV organisation, children and youth were seen as the ideal starting point for peace education.  Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships and to learn about what life is really like where they come from. Local programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding.

The first village was held in 1951 in Glendale, Ohio; commissioned for its 50th anniversary, the sculpture "How Alike I Am to You” was created in 2000 by Tim Werrell and stands on the property of the Harry Whiting Brown Community Center in Glendale, Ohio.

==CISV programmes==
The CISV International delivers its education through its seven official programmes:

* Village: Today, delegations composed of four children and one adult "Leader" from 10–12 countries come together for a four-week programme for 11-year-old children, who participate in activities based around simple activities that indirectly promote peace and understanding of each other.  Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader. Additionally, there are five or six Junior Counsellors (JCs, age 16–17) invited, who should be a care-taking "older sibling" for the 11-year-old. There is also a STAFF that takes cares of the camp and it is, usually, a group of 5-6 adults. The staff is responsible for organizing all the structure so the camp can happen.
* Step Up: A three-week programme for participants 14–15 years of age. Delegations include 4 participants and an adult leader. In Step Up's participants can think of new rules for the camp, these will be discussed and voted upon in a so-called 'camp meeting'. Also, the delegates are largely responsible for putting together activities to promote social and leadership skills. Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader.
* Interchange: Involving only two countries, this programme spans up to two years. A delegation of 6–12 youth, aged 12–14, is selected from each participating country. In the programme one delegation will travel to visit for two or four weeks with the other's family.  After those weeks and a little time in between, the delegations reciprocate. Each delegation has one adult leader, and may also have a Junior Leader.
* Youth Meeting: An 8 or 15 day programme for either 12–13, 14–15, 16–18 or 19+. This programme is based on a specific theme. For youth 12–15 each delegation consists of six young people, and an adult leader. People at the age 16+ travel alone.
* Seminar Camp: A three-week programme for youth 17–18 in which there is one or more (but not more than four) delegates from each participating country.  Seminar Camps have a more direct educational approach, and youth are encouraged to form opinions on various world issues. Usually youth-directed, this program has only thirty participants in total.
* International People's Project:  CISV's newest international programme is open to people aged 19+ and is three weeks long. Participants participate in hands-on work contributing to a community project.
* Mosaic: Mosaic is a programme that consists of projects with educational content, developed by local CISV Chapters worldwide.  These projects empower individuals to be agents of change, reach out, and involve as many people as possible.

The CISV International website provides more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/cisv-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV Chapters also hold activities that aim to share the CISV experience within their local community.

In addition to this CISV International delivers its education through:

* '''Junior Branch (JB)''': Junior Branch is an integral, but self-governing youth-based part of the structure of CISV. Junior Branch develops intercultural skills and attitude through educational and administrative activities consistent with CISV Goals.
* '''Mini Camp''': A weekend long camp within the local chapter. It is planned and run by local Juniors and leaders, often the older members of the chapter. It is a chance for participants to have a camp like experience locally and allows potential delegates and JCs to have a taste what a few days at camp may be like. Often delegate, leader and JC selection takes place at Mini Camps and activities can range from sports, to simulation activities to guest speakers and much more. 
* CISV also has other things you can do, such as being a leader, more commonly meant for the Village, Step-Up, and Interchange (Also for NYM). They are the ones who take the delegations to the Camp/Village. There are also usually 6 Junior Counselors (JC's) on a Village picked from chapters around the world who provide a link between children and adults on Villages. They are age 16-17 and it is common for there to be 2 JCs from the country the camp is being held in. On every programme there is a Staff team, usually from the hosting country although there are sometimes international staff. They are incharge of all the doings of the camp with the help of the JC's and the Leaders. When a camp is being run there is always a need for Host Families. These are families who have participants to stay at their houses when the camp has either not begun yet, has ended and participants have some time to wait before their flights leave or, in the case of a Village, when the leaders weekend off is underway. Another thing which is important is Junior Branch. There are many roles to be taken on throughout your local and national Junior Branch, these vary from country to country and national junior branch roles are usually taken on by Juniors aged 16+, however, you can contribute in many ways; from helping to plan your Junior Branch meetings to helping to raise money to host programmes.

'''Cardiac psychology''' is a specialization of [[health psychology]] that focuses on the primary and secondary prevention of [[heart disease]] by incorporating strategies to address the [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] barriers to [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes (e.g. [[smoking cessation]]), and that seeks to enhance recovery in cardiac patients by means of providing patients tools (e.g. stress management and psychotherapy) to cope with life and physical changes associated with their disease. Cardiac psychologists can help cardiac patients across the lifespan: prevention, pre-surgery, post-surgery, and [[rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation]] of cardiac disease with a particular emphasis on achieving optimal [[quality of life]] outcomes.

Cardiac psychology also includes both [[research]] and [[clinical psychology|clinical practice]] aspects. Research labs have been founded at [[Tilburg University]], [[Tilburg]] Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/corps Tilburg University]&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Susanne Pedersen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/webwijs/show/?uid=s.s.pedersen Susanne Pedersen]&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[East Carolina University]], [[Greenville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;East Carolina University, [http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/cardiacpsychology ''Cardiac Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Samuel Sears]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/searss Samuel F. Sears, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; that focus on psychological aspects of cardiac disease. Cardiac psychology as a term was first used by Robert Allan, PhD, and Stephen Schiedt, MD, as a title of their 1996 book, ''Heart and Mind: The Practice of Cardiac Psychology'' and launched increased attention to the clinical practice of cardiac psychology. More recently, additional texts, such as ''Psychotherapy with Cardiac Patients'', (2008) by Ellen Dornelas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behavioralcardiology.com/id8.html Ellen Dornelas]&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to update the literature related to clinical techniques used in the care of cardiac patients.

{{Original research|date=December 2008}}

'''Cautelary jurisprudence''' is [[law]] made in a precautionary way prior to or outside of the normal [[Legislature|legislative enactment]]. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular [[jurisprudence]] which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall.&lt;ref&gt;Tuori, Kaius. ''Ancient Roman Lawyers and Modern Legal Ideals: Studies on the Impact of Contemporary Concerns in the Interpretation of Ancient Roman Legal History'' Vittorio Klostermann: 2007 {{ISBN|3-465-04034-1}} {{ISBN|9783465040347}}; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Its first proponent was [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex]], who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the ''[[cautio muciana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary law is a tentative "procedure" used by [[lawyers]]. Initially, in [[Ancient Rome]], the idea of [[inheritance]] as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With ''cautio muciana'' it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the ''[[legatee]]s'', a "negative authority" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the ''[[legator]]''. It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The legatee provides a [[stipulatio]] or ''cautio'', promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, "I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married."

The ''cautio muciana'' is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with [[inheritance law]] and the administration of [[trusts]]. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or [[judge]]s. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">The '''Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence''' (CSTPV) is a research centre at the School of International Relations at the [[University of St. Andrews]], and is Europe's oldest [[terrorism]] research facility. The CSTPV is dedicated to the study of the causes, dynamics, characteristics and consequences of terrorism and related forms of political violence while committed to rigorous, evidence-based, scholarly analysis that is policy-relevant but independent.&lt;ref name="handa"&gt;{{cite web| title =About the Centre|  url =http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~cstpv/about.html|publisher=The Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CSTPV investigates the responses of states, civil society, and international organizations to violent modes of waging conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Herbert-Burns, Sam Bateman and Peter Lehr (eds.), Lloyd's MIU Handbook of Maritime Security, (Fl: Auerbach Publications, 2008) p.xix&lt;/ref&gt; As the basis of its work, the CSTPV maintains databases, manifestations, and consequences of terrorism and other forms of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's MIU Handbook of Maritime Security, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTPV has been able to expand its research and teaching work as the result of a donation from the [[Worldwide Support for Development]] (WSD), chaired by Japanese religious leader [[Haruhisa Handa]]. Hence it was also named as Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence.&lt;ref name="handa"/&gt;

==History==
The Centre was founded in 1994 by [[Paul Wilkinson (academic)|Paul Wilkinson]] and [[Bruce Hoffman]]&lt;ref name="cstpv"&gt;{{cite web| title =CSTPV Hoffman News|  url =http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~cstpv/news/index_files/bruce-hoffman.php|publisher=The Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the [[RAND Corporation|Rand]]-St. Andrews terrorism incident database which provides data for their studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hsinchun Chen, Edna Reid, Joshua Sinai, Andrew Silke, Boaz Ganor (eds.), Terrorism Informatics: Knowledge Management and Data Mining for Homeland Security, (New York: Springer, 2008) p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 whilst head of Politics and International Relations at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]], Wilkinson had established The Terrorism Research Unit in the department, which developed a terrorism database in coordination with [[RAND Corporation|RAND]]. At that time RAND's terrorism database was overseen by [[Brian Michael Jenkins|Brian Jenkins]] who in 1989 was replaced by Bruce Hoffman. Hoffman left RAND to set up CSTPV some time in 1994.

In 1998 Bruce Hoffman returned to RAND and Paul Wilkinson took over as Director, amalgamating the role with his position as Chairman. When Wilkinson stepped down [[Magnus Ranstorp]] was appointed Acting Director and then briefly Director from early to mid 2005.

In May 2006 [[Alex P. Schmid|Alex Schmid]] took over as Director.  That autumn CSTPV moved into new premises, occupying now the whole second floor of the West-wing of the New Arts Building.

==Academic programmes==
CSTPV offer a full-time [[Postgraduate Diploma]]/[[M.Litt]] in Terrorism Studies along with two long distance [[E-learning|E-learning courses]]. CSTPV currently runs two E-Learning courses, an online Certificate in Terrorism course, with their commercial partners [[Informa]], and a part-time E-Learning PG Dip/M.Litt in Terrorism Studies. The development of these courses is overseen by the Terrorism Studies Programme Board.

'''Chatham University''' is an American [[university]] that has [[coeducational]] academic programs through the doctoral level, with its main campus located in the [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Chatham University maintains its Eastside Campus at the corner of Shadyside and the [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/eastside.cfm |title=Chatham Eastside &amp;#124; Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA |website=Chatham.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campus serves the Health Sciences and Architecture programs. In 2013, Chatham opened its Eden Hall Campus to house the Falk School of Sustainability and is located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatham.edu/edenhall/ |title=Eden Hall Campus &amp;#124; Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA |website=Chatham.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current university student population of 2,110 includes 1,002 undergraduate students and 1,108 graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chatham Quick Facts|url=http://www.chatham.edu/about/quickfacts.cfm|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University grants certificates and degrees including bachelor, master, first-professional, and doctorate in the School of Arts, Science, and Business, the School of Health Sciences, and the Falk School of Sustainability.

==History==
Founded as the '''Pennsylvania Female College''' on December 11, 1869, by Reverend William Trimble Beatty (the father of renowned operatic [[contralto]] [[Louise Homer]]), Chatham was initially situated in the Berry mansion on Woodland Road off Fifth Avenue in the neighborhood of Shadyside. The campus today is composed of buildings and grounds from a number of former private mansions, including those of [[Andrew Mellon]], Edward Stanton Fickes, George M. Laughlin Jr. and James Rea.  It was renamed '''Pennsylvania College for Women''' in 1890, and as '''Chatham College''' in 1955.  The name served to honor [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]] and namesake of the City of [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=chatham%20university;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-dar192508 William Pitt Family Papers, 1757-1804], DAR.1925.08, [[The Darlington Collection]], Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;  The school gained [[university]] status from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] on April 23, 2007, and publicly announced its new status on 2007-05-01, changing its name to Chatham University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07121/782468-100.stm|accessdate=2009-08-16|date=2007-05-01|first=Tim|last=Grant|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|title=Chatham gains university status}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With elements designed for the original Andrew Mellon estate by the [[Olmsted Brothers]], the {{convert|39|acre|ha|sing=on}} Chatham campus was designated an [[arboretum]] in 1998 by the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta.  It features over 115 different varieties of species, including Japanese Flowering Crabapple, [[River Birch]] and [[Kentucky Coffee Tree]].

In 2005 the University expanded its programs to include online advanced degree programs (bachelors, masters, doctoral) through the School of Continuing Education, now the College for Continuing and Professional Studies.  Two years later, Chatham's M.F.A. Program in Creative Writing was named one of the top five Innovative/Unique Programs by ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708/mfa-programs|accessdate=2009-08-16|year=2007|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly|title=The Best of the Best|first=Edward J.|last=Delaney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatham received some national attention in 2014 when it announced that it was engaging in a period of study "considering admitting men for the first time in that college's history,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schackner |first=Bill |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/breaking/2014/02/18/Chatham-U-trustees-approve-resolution-to-study-going-all-coed/stories/201402180194 |title=Chatham University considers enrolling men as undergraduate students &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Post-gazette.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in "reactions of surprise and anger" from its alumnae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schackner |first=Bill |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2014/02/19/Chatham-graduates-express-shock-at-possible-co-ed-move-wage-fight-to-keep-undergraduate-college-single-sex/stories/201402190157 |title=Coed possibility concerns Chatham alumnae &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Post-gazette.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The current president of Chatham University is David Finegold, DPhil. Dr. Finegold, a graduate of Harvard University and a Rhodes Scholar who received his doctorate from Oxford University, became the 19th president in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President's Bio|url=https://www.chatham.edu/about/presidents_bio.cfm|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the retirement of [[Esther Barazzone|Dr. Esther Barazzone]] after a 24-year tenure.

==Campuses==
The original Shadyside Campus is part of historic Woodland Road. The Shadyside Campus now includes Chatham Eastside,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chatham.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=316 Chatham.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421004254/http://www.chatham.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=316 |date=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as the home for health science and architecture programs. 
 
The University's new {{convert|388|acre|ha|adj=on}} Eden Hall Campus is located north of the city in Richland Township, Pa. and is the home of Chatham's new Falk School of Sustainability. Programs at Eden Hall Campus include a BS/BA in Sustainability, a Masters in Sustainability, an MFA in Food Studies, and a dual degree Masters in Sustainability / Masters in Business Administration. The Eden Hall Campus was donated to Chatham University by the Eden Hall Foundation on May 1, 2008. In 2011, the University engaged the architectural team of Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM) of Kansas City, Mo. and the landscape design firm Andropogon Associates of Philadelphia to lead the master planning process. The first phase of development, which won an award for sustainable development was completed by the firm Mithun in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mithun.com/project/chatham-university-eden-hall-campus/?from=featured|title=Chatham University Eden Hall Campus - Mithun|work=Mithun|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chatham.edu/news/index.php/2017/04/chatham-news/eden-hall-campus-receives-american-institute-of-architects-award-for-sustainable-design-excellence|title=Eden Hall Campus receives American Institute of Architects Award for Sustainable Design Excellence|date=2017-04-20|work=Chatham News|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Chatham University teams, also known as the Cougars, participate as a member of the [[NCAA Division III]]. The Cougars are a member of the [[Presidents' Athletic Conference]] (PAC). Women's sports include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Men's and women's ice hockey play in the [[United Collegiate Hockey Conference]].

The women's ice hockey team was the first NCAA women's ice hockey team in Pennsylvania.

The college mascot was previously Pennsy the Seal. The cougar mascot was adopted in 1992 and was named Carson in honor of alumna [[Rachel Carson]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="mascot"/&gt;

==Notable alumnae==
Among Chatham's notable alumnae is [[biologist]] and [[zoologist]] [[Rachel Carson]] (1929), after whom the Rachel Carson Institute at Chatham is named.  The RCI, as it is known, promotes understanding of [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues through conferences, lectures, discussion panels, and other methods.  In honor of Rachel Carson's legacy, the University President, Esther L. Barazzone, Ph.D. and others led a campaign to rename the Ninth Street Bridge in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] as the [[Rachel Carson Bridge]].  The naming resolution was passed by [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] Council on December 6, 2005.  The Rachel Carson Bridge is one of the "Three Sisters" Bridges, opened between 1926 and 1928, and designed by County architect Stanley L. Roush and the Allegheny County Department of Public Works. The [[Roberto Clemente Bridge]] (formerly Sixth Street Bridge) and the [[Andy Warhol Bridge]] (formerly Seventh Street Bridge) complete the trio of bridges. They are the only trio of nearly identical bridges and were the first self-anchored suspension spans built in the United States. They are among the only surviving examples of large [[eyebar]]-[[chain]] [[suspension bridge]]s in the country.

Other notable alumnae include:

*[[Catherine Chisholm Cushing]], playwright
*[[Kathie L. Olsen]] ’74, Ph.D., past deputy director, [[National Science Foundation]]
*[[Elaine Scarry]] Ph.D. ’68, author and Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Lea Wait]] ’68, author of mystery novels, and children's books

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7744">'''Distinguishable interfaces''' use computer graphic principles to automatically
generate easily distinguishable appearance for computer data.

Although the [[desktop metaphor]] revolutionized user interfaces, there is evidence
that a spatial layout alone does little to help in locating files and other data;
distinguishable appearance is also required.
Studies have shown that average users have considerable difficulty finding files
on their personal computers, even ones that they created the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Search engines do not always help, since it has been found that users
often know of the existence of a file without being able to specify relevant search terms.
On the contrary, people appear to incrementally search for files using some form of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently researchers and web developers have argued that the problem is the
lack of distinguishable appearance:  in the traditional computer interface most objects
and locations appear identical.  This problem rarely occurs in the real world, where
both objects and locations generally have easily distinguishable appearance.
Discriminability was one of the recommendations in the 
ISO 9241-12 recommendation on presentation of information on visual displays
(part of the overall report on [[ISO_9241|Ergonomics of Human System Interaction]]),
however it was assumed in that report that this would be achieved by manual 
design of graphical symbols.

==VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons==
The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches
that make better use of the brain's "visual hardware", by providing
individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance.
This idea initially appeared in strictly academic 
VisualIDs&lt;ref name="visualids"&gt;

works, but the web community has explored and rapidly adopted similar ideas, such as the [[Identicon]].

The VisualIDs project&lt;ref name="visualids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Kanellos 
  | first = Michael
  | title = Cnet News: Navigating PCs with pictures, not words

automatically generated icons for files or other data based 
on a hash of the data identifier, so the icons had no relation to the content or meaning of the data.
It was argued not only that generating meaningful icons is unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Lewis
  | first = J.P.
  | title = VisualIDs: FAQ
  | url = http://scribblethink.org/Work/VisualIDs/visualids_faq.html#meaningful
  | accessdate = 19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (their user study showed rapid learning of the arbitrary icons), 
but also that basing icons on ''content'' is actually ''incorrect''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Lewis
  | first = J.P.
  | title = VisualIDs: FAQ

  | accessdate = 19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("contrasting visualization with visual identifiers"&lt;ref name="visualids" /&gt;).

The Semanticons project&lt;ref name="semanticons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Piquepaille
  | first = Roland 
  | title = ZDNET: Semanticons reveal the meaning of files
  | url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/emergingtech/semanticons-reveal-the-meaning-of-files/116
  | accessdate = 26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files.
In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve
related image(s) from an image database.  These are then processed using a [[Non-photorealistic rendering]] technique in order to generate graphical icons.

Developer Don Park introduced the [[identicon]] library for making a visual icon from a hash
of a data identifier.  This initial public implementation has spawned a large number
of implementations for various environments.  In particular, identicons are
now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems.  They are also used as a complement to [[Gravatar]]s, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.
(see [[#External links]]).

==Current research==
While current web practice has followed the semantics-free approach of VisualIDs,
recent research has followed the semantics-based approach of Semanticons.
Examples include using data mining principles to automatically create "intelligent icons"
that reflect the contents of files&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==History==
[[File:Hundert Jahre Bilder aus der Stadt Zürich - Das Polytechnikum 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Polytechnikum'' in 1865]]
[[File:ETH Zentrum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|ETH Zürich Zentrum]]
ETH was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'') at various sites throughout the city of Zurich.&lt;ref name=hist45-55&gt;{{cite web |title=1848–1855: The polytechnical realisation of a long-held dream |url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/portrait/history/epochs/1848-1855.html |publisher=ETH Zürich |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially composed of six faculties: [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], and an integrated department for the fields of [[mathematics]], natural sciences, literature, and social and [[political science]]s.

It is locally still known as ''Polytechnikum'', or simply as ''Poly'', derived from the original name ''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/ |title=ETHistory 1855-2005 |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2005 |website=ETHistory  |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to "'''federal polytechnic school'''".

ETH is a ''federal'' institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the [[University of Zürich]] is a ''[[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]]'' institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/epochen/debatte1/index_EN |title=1848-1855: Polytechnical realization of an old dream |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=31 March 2005 |website=ETHistory |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zürich.

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of [[Jérôme Franel]], the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule''. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the "''ETH Domain''" with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/overview |title=ETH Domain |publisher=ETH Board |location=Zurich and Berne, Switzerland |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular [[College and university rankings|rankings]] place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1-5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3-10 best universities of the world.

Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. There are [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|32 Nobel Laureates]] who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is [[Richard F. Heck]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955) |url=http://www.zuerich.com/en/Visitor/Information/facts/famous-zurich-residents/albert-einstein.html|journal=Zuerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[QS World University Rankings]] placed ETH Zurich at 7th overall in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019 |website=Top Universities |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds |accessdate=16 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ETH was ranked 5th in the world in Engineering, Science and Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[National University of Singapore]].

In 2016, [[Times Higher Education World University Ranking]]s ranked ETH Zurich 9th overall in the world and 8th in the world in the field of Engineering &amp; Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings|title=ETH Zurich – Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a comparison of Swiss universities by [http://rankingswissup.ch/ swissUP Ranking] and in rankings published by [http://www.che.de CHE] comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH Zurich traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences.

In the survey [http://www.excellenceranking.org CHE ExcellenceRanking] on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. ETH Zurich had a total budget of 1.885 billion CHF&lt;ref name=AR2017/&gt; in the year 2017.

==Admission and education==
{{ETH Institutes}}
[[File:ETH Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Students and locals in ETH front courtyard]]
For Swiss students, ETH is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the ''[[Matura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to the first semester with a Swiss matriculation certificate ("Matura") | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/swiss-matriculation.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the ''reduced entrance exam'' or the ''comprehensive entrance exam'' although some applicants from several European countries are exempted from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the ''comprehensive entrance exam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to first semester without Swiss matriculation certificate |work= ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester (only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends). After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the ''Basisprüfung''. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire ''Basisprüfung'' which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. About 50% of the students fail the ''Basisprüfung'' on the first try and many of them choose to drop out of the course instead of repeating the ''Basisprüfung''.
The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the ''Basisprüfung'' (Basis examination), but with a higher success rate.
The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and three or four further semesters for the [[Master of Science]] degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.

Education at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of [[mathematics|mathematical training]]. The main language of instruction in undergraduate (Bachelor) studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Language requirements | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates/language-requirements.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master's programmes and doctoral studies are in English.

==Campus==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--only the last sentence has a citation--&gt;
[[File:ETH-Hoenggerberg-2008.jpg|thumb|320px|ETH Hönggerberg with the new HIT building]]
ETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, the ETH spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the ''Zentrum'' campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zürich and firmly integrates the ETH in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the [[University Hospital of Zurich]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the ''Hönggerberg'' on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the ''Hönggerberg'' location houses the departments of [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]] and [[physics]].

===Main building===
[[File:ETH Zürich Hauptgebäude, Ansicht von der Polyterasse 2011-08-06 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|Main building as seen from ''Polyterrasse'']]
[[File:ETH Zürich im Abendlicht.jpg|thumb|ETH Zurich at night.]]
The main building of ETH was built from 1858 to 1864 under [[Gustav Zeuner]]; the architect, however, was [[Gottfried Semper]], who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Donato Bramante]]. During the construction of the University of Zürich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH building was enlarged and received its impressive [[cupola]].

===Science City===
In the year of ETH Zurich's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called "Science City" for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.
[[File:ETH Hönggerberg Frontansicht.JPG|540px|center|thumb|ETH Hönggerberg from the south, looking at the five "fingers" of the HCI and behind the high HPP building.]]

In September 2014 a new project to connect Science City by train was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf-innovation.com/publikationen/by_rail_2014_S26-27.pdf |title=Tunnelbahnhof für "Science City" |website=www.adf-innovation.com |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics====
The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) and the use of [[ion beam]] based techniques with applications in [[archeology]], [[earth sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[Materials science|material sciences]] and [[physics|fundamental physics]]. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare [[Radionuclide|radionuclides]] with [[radiocarbon dating]] and the use of techniques such as [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry]] or [[elastic recoil detection]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{Cite web

==Student life==
ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.ch/page_news_article.php?typ=157&amp;id=2382 "Willkommen auf Students.ch"] {{De icon}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduates' tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the [[VSETH]] (''Verband der Studierenden an der ETH'') which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zürich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the ''Polyball'', the ''Polyparty'' (does not exist any more) and the ''Erstsemestrigenfest'', the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual ''Erstsemestrigenfest'' takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the [[Zürich Airport]]. All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event.

Some of the notable associations that are not affiliated with a specific department are the ETH Entrepreneur Club and ETH Model United Nations. Both organisations enjoy high international standings and are regularly awarded for excellence in their field.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ETH Juniors is another student run organisation. It forms a bridge between the industry and ETH and offers many services for students and companies alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethjuniors.ch/en/about-us|title=ETH Juniors|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academic Sports Association of Zürich''' (ASVZ) offers more than 120 sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/english/Seiten/default.aspx | title=Academic Sports Association Zurich | accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest annual sports event is the ''SOLA-Stafette'' (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/SOLA09.aspx SOLA-Stafette 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The 40th edition of the SOLA, held on May 4, 2013, had 900 enrolled teams, of which 893 started and 876 were classified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/news/Seiten/ErfolgreicheJubilaeumsstafette.aspx SOLA - Erfolgreiche Jubiläumsstafette]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 ASVZ celebrated their 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://75jahreasvz.ch|title=ASVZ|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801034944/http://75jahreasvz.ch/|archivedate=1 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The annual [[Polyball]]  is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the ''Polyball'' welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The ''Polyball'' is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.

The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zürich has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] match between teams from the two institutions on the river [[Limmat]].

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual ''Wolfgang Pauli Lectures'', in honor of former ETH Professor [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]]s, have held lectures of the various fields of [[natural science]]s at this conference since 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18325">The '''Earth Charter''' is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/What-is-the-Earth-Charter%3F.html "What is the Earth Charter?"].&lt;/ref&gt; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that [[environmental protection]], [[human rights]], equitable [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and [[world peace|peace]] are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The [[Earth Charter Initiative]] organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by [[Maurice Strong]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as members of The [[Club of Rome]], when the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] called for a new charter to guide the transition to [[sustainable development]]. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-[[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Earth Summit]], but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The [[Rio Declaration]] became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, [[Maurice Strong]] (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], working through organizations they each founded (the [[Earth Council]] and [[Green Cross International]] respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a [[civil society]] initiative, with the help of the government of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="mstrong"&gt;Maurice Strong: [http://www.mauricestrong.net/2009013070/earth-charter.html "History of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong died in November 2015.&lt;ref name="mstrong" /&gt;

"The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkofhope.org|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.arkofhope.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at [[Middlebury College]] and an advisory trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven C. Rockefeller |url=http://earthcharter.org/about/steven-c-rockefeller/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|title=Charting a New Course: An Interview with Steven Rockefeller|last=Schwarz|first=Sherry|date=2001|website=abroadview.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502055548/http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee". Other members included [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] (Mali), [[Princess Basma bint Talal]] (Jordan), [[Mohamed Sahnoun]] (Algeria), [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] (Sri Lanka), [[Wakako Hironaka]] (Japan), [[Erna Witoelar]] (Indonesia), [[Ruud Lubbers]] (The Netherlands), [[Federico Mayor]] (Spain), [[Mercedes Sosa]] (Argentina), [[Leonardo Boff]] (Brazil), [[Yolanda Kakabadse]] (Ecuador), [[Shridath Ramphal]] (Guyana), [[Elizabeth May]] (Canada), [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] (Canada), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission |url=http://earthcharter.org/about-eci/commission/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

== Contents ==
The approximately 2,400 word document is divided into sections (called pillars), which have sixteen main principles containing sixty-one supporting principles.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Dower, University of Aberdeen (2004): [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/invent/images/uploads/The%20Earth%20Charter%20as%20a%20Global%20Ethic.pdf "The Earth Charter as a Global Ethic"], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document opens with a preamble and ends with a conclusion entitled “The Way Forward”.

===Preamble===
{{cquote|We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations.&lt;ref name="ECdoc"&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html "Text of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:&lt;ref name="ECdoc" /&gt;

'''I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life'''
:1. Respect Earth and life in all its diversity.
:2. Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love.
:3. Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable and peaceful.
:4. Secure Earth's bounty and beauty for present and future generations.

'''II. Ecological Integrity'''
:5. Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life.

In the UK, Bournemouth Borough Council endorsed the Charter in 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the [[United States]], members of religious groups, such as the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] have objected to the document on the grounds that it is [[secularism|secular]], and espouses [[socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009| reason=Please, provide a reliable source for this assertion. Nowhere on the Internet, I could find the mentioned objections.}} In addition, some conservatives{{Who|date=November 2009}} cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is "a kind of [[Ten Commandments]]" and point to the fact that at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an "Ark of Hope" — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world's religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative.

'''Ecological economics''' (also called '''eco-economics''', '''ecolonomy''' or '''bioeconomics''' of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen]]) is both a [[transdisciplinary]] and an [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research addressing the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s, both intertemporally and spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of [[natural capital]], the field of '''ecological economics''' is differentiated from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Paehlke|Paehlke R.]] (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

[https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as [[cost-benefit analysis]], and the separability of economic values from scientific research, contending that economics is unavoidably [[Normative economics|normative]] rather than [[Positive economics|positive]] (i.e. descriptive).&lt;ref name=Victor2008&gt;Peter Victor.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

European predecessors of ecological economics include [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944)&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Romania]]n economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 saw the foundation of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] and publication of its journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', by [[Elsevier]]. [[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]] and [[H.T. Odum]], biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. In the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition, sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]] and CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly center ecological concerns in [[political economy]].

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in ''Nature'', the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global [[GDP]] was $27 trillion).&lt;ref name=Costanza1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costanza R | year = 1998 | title = The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital1 | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800998000202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the value went to [[nutrient cycling]]. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004).

Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997.

Ecological Economics 25, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists [[commodification]] of everything external to the market system.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F., 1993.

Ambio 26, 546-550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatn, A., 2000. The environment as commodity. Environmental Values 9, 493-509&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

=== Energy economics ===
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|275px|Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. "Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  US news outlets treated the stories as a "threat"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/ |title=Ecuador threat to drill jungle oil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218035742/http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/|archivedate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "drill a park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3980994 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems.  However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote "[[free trade]]" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706-713 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105133/http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/bookentry_main.lasso?id=2951 Modelling in Ecological Economics], Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]], and [[Stock-Flow consistent model]] frameworks. [[System dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling.  A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voinov|first=Alexey|title=Systems science and modeling for ecological economics|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080886175|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying "the common good"&lt;ref&gt;Felber, Christian (2012), "La economia del bien commun" (Duestro)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta P. Nature’s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

Goseck, a [[monastery]] built on the foundations of a [[castle]], as well as the [[vineyard]] of Dechantenberg is located in the municipality of Goseck of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in [[Germany]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== World Heritage Nomination ==
Goseck and its vineyard is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. Together with the agricultural features on the northern slopes of the Saale and the sandstone quarries used for the building of the monastery, this ensemble conveys the different forms of land use of the [[medieval]] monastery structures.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Vineyard Steinmeister.jpg|thumb|Vineyard Steinmeister]]
Goseck Castle was part of a network of [[Franks|Frankish]] [[castles]] on the [[Saale]] River. It was founded around the year 800. The counts of Goseck were one of the noblest aristocratic families of the empire in the [[10th Century in Germany|10th]] and [[11th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Pfalzgrafen von Sachsen bis zum Jahre 1088. ''In:'' Braunschweigisches Jahrbuch 36.|trans-title= The palsgraves of Saxony until the year 1088.''In:'' Yearbook of Braunschweig 36.|page=24–52|author=Starke, Heinz-Dieter|publisher=City of Braunschweig|date=1955|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Count Frederick I of Goseck had his center of power in Goseck . In 1041, Adalbert (archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen from 1043) founded a [[Benedictine monastery]] in the eastern part of the noble castle of Goseck. The minster was erected in 1046.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. Zum Stand der baugeschichtlichen Erforschung. ''In:'' Denkmalpﬂege in Sachsen-Anhalt 7 |trans-title=Castle, monastery and palace Goseck. Research on the building history. In: Preservation of historical monuments in Saxony-Anhalt 7.|page=1–30|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
It is situated 9 kilometers northeast of Naumburg across the Saale Valley on the opposite bank. This monastery of the 11th century is a preserved and documented structure of the High Middle Ages. It was built to be visible from afar, offering lines of sight to most of the monuments in the nominated areas.

== Architecture ==
The [[crypt]] and [[choir]] of the monastery church display the very best of [[Salian]] architecture. Goseck is an example for the transformation of a noble family’s hereditary seat into a monastery with dynastic memorial tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quellen zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte von Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. ''In:'' Saale-Unstrut-Jahrbuch 4. |trans-title=Sources on history and building history of the castle, monastery and palace Goseck. In: Yearbook of Saale-Unstrut 4.|page=28–43|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viniculture ==
In the chronicles of the Benedictines of the Goseck monastery the terraced vineyard below the site is dated back to the year 1093; it is the oldest vineyard in continuous use in the nominated region. The Dechantenberg vineyard is exposed to the south.  


== Today == 
 
Around 1540, the monastery was secularized. Since 1997, Goseck is owned by the »Landesstiftung Dome und Schlösser Sachsen-Anhalt«, a state foundation endowed by the State of Saxony-Anhalt . Today, a European Centre for Music and Culture (“Europäisches Musik und Kulturzentrum”) resides in Goseck and offers a range of cultural activities.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For further information: http://www.dome-schloesser.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility''' has been offered since 1987 at [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] throughout the [[United States]] and the world. The Pledge states: ''I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work.'' The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their [[employment]] as they enter the workforce or continue their [[education]]. It is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. Over one hundred Universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including the following:

Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others work to make changes after they are on the job. Some examples include promoting [[recycling]] at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for [[gender equality]] in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment.

The Pledge was first established at [[Humboldt State University]], [[California]], in 1987. Manchester University in [[Indiana]] hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time [[Bentley University]] near [[Boston]] became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the Pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the Pledge into the formal program for their Commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at Commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a "capstone" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209232933/http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student Pledge coordinator internship.
The Pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduationpledge.org |title=Graduation Pledge Alliance &amp;#124; Social and Environmental Responsibility Works |website=Graduationpledge.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20333">The '''green gross domestic product''' ('''green GDP''' or '''GGDP''') is an index of [[economic growth]] with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country's conventional [[GDP]]. Green GDP monetizes the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], and accounts for costs caused by [[climate change]]. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as "[[waste]] [[per capita]]" or "[[carbon dioxide emissions]] per year"), which may be aggregated to indices such as the "[[Sustainable Development Index]]".

==Calculation==

Calculating green GDP requires that net [[natural capital]] consumption, including [[resource depletion]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[environmental protection|protective]] and [[environmental restoration|restorative]] environmental initiatives, be subtracted from traditional GDP.&lt;ref name="Fitoussi"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [http://templatelab.com/rapport-anglais/ "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some early calculations of green GDP take into account one or two but not all environmental adjustments. These calculations can also be applied to [[net domestic product]] (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP. In each case, it is necessary to convert the resource activity into a monetary value, since it is in this manner that indicators are generally expressed in national accounts.

==Rationale==

The motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP has as an indicator of [[economic performance]] and [[social progress]]. It only assesses gross output, and does not have a mechanism for identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output.&lt;ref name="WAVES"/&gt; This is problematic because it cannot account for permanent or significant depletion or replenishment of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of [[income]] generated in a country is [[sustainable]]. Richard Stone, one of the creators the original GDP indicator, suggested that while "the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-[[demographic]] and environmental phenomenon", he had done little work in the area of [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1984/stone-lecture.pdf "The Accounts of Society"], "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1984", 8 December 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, natural capital is poorly represented in GDP; resources are not adequately considered as economic assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy "Policy Recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075450/http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy |date=2013-04-20 }}, "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to their costs, companies and policy makers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands and agriculture are unaccounted for or otherwise hidden because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets.&lt;ref name="WAVES"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/natural-capital-accounting?active=1 "Natural Capital Accounting"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the impact that the [[depletion of natural resources]] or increases in [[pollution]] can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.&lt;ref name="WAVES" /&gt;

The need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sesric.org/files/article/52.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Growth and Development with Special Reference to a System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA): The Indonesian Experience"], "Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries"&lt;/ref&gt; GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries' abilities to manage their economies and resources.

==History==
Many economists, scientists and other scholars have theorized about adjusting [[macroeconomic]] [[economic indicator|indicator]]s to account for [[environmental change]]. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).&lt;ref&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811080135/http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf |date=2007-08-11 }}, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW).&lt;ref name="MEW"&gt;William Nordhaus and James Tobin, [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf "Is Growth Obsolete?"], National Bureau of Economic Research, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work and [[environmental damage]]s.&lt;ref name="MEW" /&gt; They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.

Repetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance.&lt;ref name="Jeroen"&gt;Jeroen van den Bergh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6bwKkM1GC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into "aggregate measures of economic performance".&lt;ref name="Jeroen" /&gt;

In their seminal report, "Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development", Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several [[UNEP]]-[[World Bank]] sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop [[environmental accounting]] as a [[public policy]] tool.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;Edited by Yusuf J. Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/12/03/000178830_98101901491957/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development"], The World Bank, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of all of the authors' arguments is that the [[system of national accounts]] (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy in their respective chapters.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

In "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation", John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock by representing the use of natural resources as "economic depreciation magnitudes".&lt;ref&gt;John Hartwick, [http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/working_papers/papers/qed_wp_771.pdf "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation"], Queen's University, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]] (SEEA), published by the [[United Nations]] as an appendix to the 1993 SNA.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the "Global Initiatives" section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green [[GDP]] is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.&lt;ref&gt;London Group on Environmental Accounting, [http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-ve-seea.pdf "Why We Need the SEEA"], ''Beyond GDP'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).

In 1993, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP and that's where things stand today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | date=April 9, 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602190235/http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph (2008), presentation in New York, 5 Feb 2008, "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q_PA_czIKM&amp;feature=related video from 3:18]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 [[ecosystem services]] for 16 biomes.&lt;ref name="Costanza"&gt;Costanza et al., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6630/abs/387253a0.html "The Value of the World's Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital"], ''Nature'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals' "willingness-to-pay" for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt;

Kunte et al. (1998) use their paper "Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results" to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a "practical [and necessary] exercise".&lt;ref name="Kunte"&gt;Kunte et al., [http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/archive/Framework/Kunte_etal_1998.PDF "Estimating National Wealth"], The World Bank, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. "Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction."&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt; Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt;

Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3147043 "Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], National Academy Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high priority goals for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus" /&gt; One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.

In 2004, [[Wen Jiabao]], the Chinese premier, announced that the green [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua (2007) "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm Call for return to green accounting]", ''China Daily'', 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and [[resource depletion]] was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J. and Yardley, J. (2007) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html Choking on Growth: As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes]", ''The New York Times'', 26 Aug 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have for the last decade ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, Elizabeth (2007) "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html Green GDP: Accounting for the Environment in China]", ''China from the Inside'', U.S. Public Broadcasting System.&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.

The most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country's environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that "It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country's chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India's GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of [[environmental degradation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-to-release--green-GDP--data-from-2015/544338/|title=India to release green GDP data from 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]'s (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of [[UNEP]] and works in cooperation with the [[United Nations Global Compact]]. It produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting&amp;mdash;also known as [[ecological footprint]] reporting, [[Environmental Social and Corporate Governance|environmental social governance]] (ESG) reporting, [[triple bottom line]] (TBL) reporting, and [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.

==Current debate==

Some critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.

Supporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.

A second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi remark that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin's SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability."&lt;ref name="Fitoussi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Chikan Sign.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A sign outside of a bicycle parking lot in Chiba, Japan, warns "Beware of groping".]]
When used in a sexual context, '''groping''' or '''fondling''' is [[Physical intimacy|touching]] another person in an unwelcome sexual way. The term generally has a negative connotation in many societies, and the activity may be considered [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Toucherism]]'', considered a [[paraphilia]], describes the practice of a person touching another non-consenting person with their hands, typically in crowds, for their own sexual pleasure. Touching a consenting person's body during [[sexual activity]], [[massage]], or [[medical examination]] is not usually considered groping, though the term is sometimes used to include clumsy, selfish, or inappropriate sexual touching.  Areas of the body most frequently groped include the [[buttocks]], [[breast]]s, [[vulva]] and [[thigh]]s on a woman, and the [[penis]], [[testicle]]s and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but pressing any part of their body against another person can be considered groping.

The incidence of groping varies around the world, and some countries have acquired a reputation for it. In some countries, it is common for a woman's buttocks to be pinched or slapped in a crowded area. In many countries, non-consensual sexual touching of any part of another person's body is considered to be sexual assault and is illegal, but in almost all countries it is considered unacceptable behaviour. Italy used to have a reputation for men pinching women's bottoms, and the term groping could perhaps be applied, but it was not a common term at that time (mid-20th century, for example). Japan has a reputation for females being groped on trains and buses to the extent that the authorities have implemented anti-groping campaigns, which has received considerable media attention and been the subject of serious study in recent years. In parts of [[South Asia]], including [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;The Express Tribune, July 8, 2013: [http://tribune.com.pk/story/572526/eve-teasing-the-power-game/ Eve teasing: The power game], by Tehniya S Afridi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal]]&lt;ref&gt;Smriti Lakhey, [http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html  "Eve Teasing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620213348/http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article1549.html |date=2010-06-20 }}, ''[[Wave (magazine)|Wave]]'' # 55, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137  "Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012100511/http://www.thedailystar.net/eve-teasers-beat-dead-youth-in-dhaka-45137 |date=2014-10-12 }}, ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|Daily Star]]'', 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; public [[sexual harassment]] or [[Sexual assault|molestation]] (often known as "[[street harassment]]") of women by men is widely referred to as [[Eve teasing]].

In Japan, men who grope women in public are called ''chikan'' (痴漢, チカン, or ちかん); and the term also describes the act itself. Crowded trains are a favorite location for groping and a 2001 survey conducted in two Tokyo high schools revealed that more than 2/3rds of students had been groped while traveling on them.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buerk|first1=Roland|title=Tokyo police act on train gropers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8254389.stm|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=BBC|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the effort to combat the problem, some railway companies designate [[women-only passenger car]]s during rush hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071226060039/http://www.belsona-strategic.com/hisandhers_subway.htm The His and Hers Subway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 "Japan Tries Women Only Train Cars to Stop Groping: Tokyo Subway Experiment Attempts to Slow Epidemic of Subway Fondling"] An ABC News article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071218143817/http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/35/11500 "Women Only Cars on Commuter Trains Cause Controversy in Japan"]&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is not defined in the Japanese legal system, vernacular usage of the word describes acts that violate several laws. Although crowded trains are the most frequent targets, another common setting is bicycle parking areas, where people bending over unlocking locks are targets. Chikan is often featured in [[Japanese pornography]].

This issue affects men in a different way. Since Japan has a very high conviction rate (99% by some sources), innocent men may have difficulty proving their innocence in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 February 2007 |title=Tokyo legal drama gets grip on groping |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |deadurl=yes |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731162401/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=7&amp;art_id=38575&amp;sid=12296751&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070220 |archivedate=31 July 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[I Just Didn't Do It]]'' by Japanese film director [[Masayuki Suo]], based on a true story, focuses on a male office worker acquitted of groping after a five-year legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kamiya |first=Setsuko |title='I Just Didn't Do It' questions the Japanese court system |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2007-02-02 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070202a6.html |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal courts have traditionally been lenient in cases of groping and have only recently made efforts to combat the social problem with tougher sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Lewis| first =Leo| title =All women trains are only way to defeat Tokyo bottom pinchers| publisher =The Times Online |date =2004-11-24| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article394630.ece| accessdate =2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fukada, Takahiro, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090818i1.html In anonymous packed train lurk gropers]", ''The Japan Times'', August 18, 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Groping is illegal when there is no consent. The charge can vary from state to state but generally is considered to be [[sexual battery]], sexual groping, or unlawful touching. In some jurisdictions, groping is considered "Criminal Sexual Conduct", in the second to fourth degree, if there is no penetration.

*Florida: [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP)  Officer Paulo Morales, 47, of Miami, pleaded guilty to sexually groping three women in his custody. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division stated, “The Justice Department will continue to investigate and prosecute criminal civil rights violations committed by law enforcement officials”, and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25001">'''Instrumentalism''' is an interpretation within the [[philosophy of science]] that holds that a successful scientific theory reveals nothing known either true or false about nature's unobservable objects, properties or processes.&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Anjan Chakravartty]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism: §4.1: "Empiricism", in [[Edward N. Zalta]], ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Summer 2013 edn: "Traditionally, instrumentalists maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of instrumentalism were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".

*Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), [http://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;  According to instrumentalists scientific theory is merely a tool whereby humans ''predict'' observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating laws, which state or summarize regularities, while theories themselves do not reveal supposedly hidden aspects of nature that somehow ''explain'' these laws.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt;  Initially a novel perspective introduced by [[Pierre Duhem]] in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=Duhem#v=twopage pp. 242–43]: "Like [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], Duhem was a practicing scientist who devoted an important part of his adult life to the history and philosophy of physics.  ...  His philosophy is contained in ''La théorie physique: son objet, sa structure'' [''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''] (1906), which may well be, to this day, the best overall book on the subject.  Its main theses, although quite novel when first put forward, have in the meantime become commonplace, so I shall review them summarily without detailed argument, just to associate them with his name.  But first I ought to say that neither in the first nor in the second (1914) edition of his book did Duhem take into account—or even so much as mention—the deep changes that were then taking place in physics.  Still, the subsequent success and current entrenchment of Duhem's ideas are due above all to their remarkable agreement with—and the light they throw on—the practice of mathematical physics in the twentieth century.  In the first part of ''La théorie physique'', Duhem contrasts two opinions concerning the aim of physical theory.  For some authors, it ought to furnish 'the ''explanation'' of a set of experimentally established laws', while for others it is 'an abstract system whose aim is to ''summarize'' and ''logically classify'' a set of experimental laws, without pretending to explain these laws' (Duhem 1914, p. 3).  Duhem resolutely sides with the latter.  His rejection of the former rests on his understanding of 'explanation' ('explication' in French), which he expresses as follows: 'To explain, ''explicare'', is to divest ''reality'' from the ''appearances'' which enfold it like veils, in order to see the reality face to face' (pp 3–4).  Authors in the first group expect from physics the true vision of [[ding-an-sich|things-in-themselves]] that religious myth and philosophical speculation have hitherto been unable to supply.  Their explanation makes no sense unless (i) there is, 'beneath the sense appearances revealed to us by our perceptions, [...] a reality different from these appearances' and (ii) we know 'the nature of the elements which constitute' that reality (p 7).  Thus, physical theory cannot explain—in the stated sense—the laws established by experiment unless it depends on metaphysics and thus remains subject to the interminable disputes of metaphysicians.  Worse still, the teachings of no metaphysical school are sufficiently detailed and precise to account for all of the elements of physical theory (p 18).  Duhem instead assigns to physical theories a more modest but autonomous and readily attainable aim: 'A physical theory is not an explanation.  It is a system of mathematical propositions, derived from a small number of principles, whose purpose is to represent a set of experimental laws as simply, as completely, and as exactly as possible (Duhem 1914, p. 24)".&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting [[scientific realism]]'s ambitions to uncover metaphysical truth about nature,&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt; instrumentalism is usually categorized as an ''antirealism'', although its mere lack of commitment to scientific theory's realism can be termed ''nonrealism''.  Instrumentalism merely bypasses debate concerning whether, for example, a ''particle'' spoken about in [[particle physics]] is a discrete entity enjoying individual existence, or is an ''excitation mode'' of a region of a field, or is something else altogether.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;P Kyle Stanford, ''Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=_JIxeQ_sfzwC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=instrumentalism+particle+physics p. 198].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=#v=twopage pp. 396–97], including quote: "First, quantum field theories have been the working theories at the frontline of physics for over 30 years.  Second, these theories appear to do away with the familiar conception of physical systems as aggregates of substantive individual particles.  This conception was already undermined by [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] and [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (§6.1.4), according to which the so-called particles cannot be assigned a definite trajectory in ordinary space.  But quantum field theories go a long step further and—or so it would seem—conceive 'particles' as excitation modes of the field.  This, I presume, motivated Howard Stein's saying that 'the quantum theory of fields is the contemporary locus of metaphysical research' (1970, p. 285).  Finally, the very fact that physicists conspicuously and fruitfully resort to unperspicacious theories can teach us something about the aim and reach of science.  Here is how physicists work, dirty-handed, in their everyday practice, a far cry from what is taught at the Sunday school of the 'scientific worldview' ".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Meinard Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields—or something else entirely], ''Scientific American'', 2013 Aug;'''309'''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Instrumentalism holds that theoretical terms need only be useful to predict the phenomena, the observed outcomes.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Instrumentalism is a variety of [[scientific anti-realism]].

==History==
===British empiricism===
{{main|British empiricism}}
Newton's theory of motion, whereby any object instantly interacts with all other objects across the universe, motivated the founder of [[British empiricism]], [[John Locke]], to speculate that matter is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  The next leading British empiricist, [[George Berkeley]], argued that an object's putative primary qualities as recognized by scientists, such as shape, extension, and impenetrability, are inconceivable without the putative secondary qualities of color, hardness, warmth, and so on. He also posed the question how or why an object could be properly conceived to exist independently of any perception of it.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley did not object to everyday talk about the reality of objects, but instead took issue with philosophers' talk, who spoke as if they knew something beyond sensory impressions that ordinary folk did not.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berkeley, a scientific theory does not state causes or explanations, but simply identifies perceived types of objects and traces their typical regularities.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus anticipated the basis of what [[Auguste Comte]] in the 1830s called ''positivism'',&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt; although Comtean positivism added other principles concerning the scope, method, and uses of science that Berkeley would have disavowed.  Berkeley also noted the usefulness of a scientific theory having terms that merely serve to aid calculations without their having to refer to anything in particular, so long as they proved useful in practice.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus predated the insight that Logical Positivists-who originated in the late 1920s, but who, by the 1950s, had softened into Logical Empiricists-would be compelled to accept: theoretical terms in science do not always translate into observational terms.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great British empiricist, [[David Hume]], posed a number of challenges to Bacon's inductivism, which had been the prevailing, or at least the professed view concerning the attainment of scientific knowledge.  Regarding himself as having placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with Newton's theory of motion, Hume supposed that he had championed inductivism over scientific realism.  Upon reading Hume's work, Immanuel Kant was "awakened from dogmatic slumber", and thus sought to neutralise any threat to science posed by Humean empiricism.  Kant would develop the first stark philosophy of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 98: "I shall dwell at some length on Kant's conception of the sources and scope of Newton's conceptual frame, for it was the first full-blown philosophy of physics and remains to this day the most significant".&lt;/ref&gt;

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
To save Newton's law of universal gravitation, [[Immanuel Kant]] reasoned that the mind is the precondition of experience and so, as the bridge from the [[noumena]], which are how the world's [[ding-an-sich|things exist in themselves]], to the [[phenomena]], which are humans' recognized experiences.  And so mind itself contains the structure that determines ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance'', how mind's own categorization of noumena renders space Euclidean, time constant, and objects' motions exhibiting the very determinism predicted by Newtonian.  Kant apparently presumed that the human mind, rather than a phenomenon itself that had evolved, had been predetermined and set forth upon the creation of humankind.  In any event, the mind also was the veil of appearance that scientific methods could never lift.  And yet the mind could ponder itself and discover such truths.  Kant's metaphysics, then, [[transcendental idealism]], secured science from doubt, and yet discarded hope of scientific realism.  Meanwhile, it was a watershed for idealist metaphysics, and launched [[German idealism]], most influentially [[Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] or objective idealism, or at least interpretations, often misinterpretations, and political misuses, of it.

===Logical empiricism===
{{main|Logical empiricism}}
According the mind virtually no power to know anything beyond direct sensory experience, [[Ernst Mach]]'s early version of [[logical positivism]] ([[empirio-criticism]]) verged on idealism.  It was alleged to even be a surreptitious [[solipsism]], whereby all that exists is one's own mind.  Mach's positivism also strongly asserted the ultimate [[unity of science|unity of the empirical science]]s.  Mach's positivism asserted [[phenomenalism]] as to new basis of scientific theory, all scientific terms to refer to either actual or potential sensations, thus eliminating hypotheses while permitting such seemingly disparate scientific theories as physical and psychological to share terms and forms.  Phenomenalism was insuperably difficult to implement, yet heavily influenced a new generation of philosophers of science, who emerged in the 1920s while terming themselves ''logical positivists'' while pursuing a program termed ''[[verificationism]]''.  Logical positivists aimed not to instruct or restrict scientists, but to enlighten and structure philosophical discourse to render ''scientific philosophy'' that would verify philosophical statements as well as scientific theories, and align all human knowledge into a ''scientific worldview'', freeing humankind from so many of its problems due to confused or unclear language.

The verificationists expected a strict gap between ''theory'' versus ''observation'', mirrored by a theory's ''[[theoretical term]]s'' versus ''[[observable term]]s''.  Believing a theory's posited unobservables to always correspond to observations, the verificationists viewed a scientific theory's theoretical terms, such as ''electron'', as metaphorical or elliptical at observations, such as ''white streak in [[cloud chamber]]''.  They believed that scientific terms lacked meanings unto themselves, but acquired meanings from the logical structure that was the entire theory that in turn matched ''patterns of experience''.  So by translating theoretical terms into observational terms and then decoding the theory's mathematical/logical structure, one could check whether the statement indeed matched patterns of experience, and thereby verify the scientific theory false or true.  Such verification would be possible, as never before in science, since translation of theoretical terms into observational terms would make the scientific theory purely empirical, none metaphysical.  Yet the logical positivists ran into insuperable difficulties.  [[Moritz Schlick]] debated with [[Otto Neurath]] over [[foundationalism]]—the traditional view traced to Descartes as founder of modern Western philosophy—whereupon only nonfoundationalism was found tenable.  Science, then, could not find a secure foundation of indubitable truth.

And since science aims to reveal not private but public truths, verificationists switched from phenomenalism to [[physicalism]], whereby scientific theory refers to objects observable in space and at least in principle already recognizable by physicists.  Finding strict empiricism untenable, verificationism underwent "liberalization of empiricism".  [[Rudolf Carnap]] even suggested that empiricism's basis was pragmatic.  Recognizing that verification—proving a theory false or true—was unattainable, they discarded that demand and focused on ''confirmation theory''.  Carnap sought simply to quantify a universal law's ''degree of confirmation''—its probable truth—but, despite his great mathematical and logical skill, discovered equations never operable to yield over ''zero'' degree of confirmation. [[Carl Hempel]] found the [[Raven paradox|paradox of confirmation]].  By the 1950s, the verificationists had established philosophy of science as subdiscipline within academia's philosophy departments.  By 1962, verificationists had asked and endeavored to answer seemingly all the great questions about scientific theory.  Their discoveries showed that the idealized ''scientific worldview'' was naively mistaken.  By then the leader of the legendary venture, Hempel raised the white flag that signaled verificationism's demise.  Suddenly striking Western society, then, was Kuhn's landmark thesis, introduced by none other than Carnap, verificationism's greatest firebrand.  Instrumentalism exhibited by ''scientists'' often does not even discern unobservable from observable entities.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Historical turn===
{{main|Historical turn}}
From the 1930s until [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', there were roughly two prevailing views about the nature of science.  The popular view was [[scientific realism]], which usually involved a belief that science was progressively unveiling a truer view, and building a better understanding, of nature.  The professional approach was [[logical empiricism]], wherein a scientific theory was held to be a logical structure whose terms all ultimately refer to some form of observation, while an objective process neutrally arbiters theory choice, compelling scientists to decide which scientific theory was superior.  Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the [[Standard Model]], were so steeped in developing [[quantum field theory]], that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was unintelligible to the public, while the steep mathematics warded off philosophers of physics.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;  By the 1980s, physicists regarded not ''particles'', but ''fields'' as the more fundamental, and no longer even hoped to discover what entities and processes might be truly fundamental to nature, perhaps not even the field.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;  Kuhn had not claimed to have developed a novel thesis, but instead hoped to synthesize more usefully recent developments in the philosophy of science.

In 1906, Duhem had introduced the problem of the [[underdetermination|underdetermination of theory by data]], since any dataset could be consistent with several different explanations, how the success of any prediction does not, by [[affirming the consequent]], a [[deductive fallacy]], logically confirm the truth of the theory in question.  In the 1930s, [[Ludwik Fleck]] had explained the role of [[perspectivism]] ([[logology]]) in science whereby scientists are trained in ''thought collectives'' to adopt particular ''thought styles'' setting expectations for a proper scientific question, scientific experiment, and scientific data.  Scientists manipulate experimental conditions to obtain results that cohere with their own expectations—what the scientists presuppose is realistic—and as a result might be tempted to invoke the [[experimenter's regress]] in order to reject unexpected results. They would then redo these experiments under what were supposedly better and more conducive conditions.  By the 1960s, physicists recognized two, differing roles of physical theory, ''formalism'' and ''interpretation''. Formalism involved mathematical equations and axioms that, upon input of physical data, yielded certain predictions.  Interpretation sought to explain ''why'' they succeeded. 

Widely read, Kuhn's 1962 thesis seemed to shatter logical empiricism, whose paradigmatic science was physics and which championed instrumentalism.  Yet scientific realists, who were far more tenacious, responded by attacking Kuhn's thesis, perennially depicted thereafter as either illuminated or infamous.  Kuhn later indicated that his thesis had been so widely misunderstood that he himself was not a ''Kuhnian''.  With logical empiricism's demise, [[Karl Popper]]'s falsificationism was in the ascendancy, and Popper was knighted in 1965. Yet in 1961, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] had made its first major empirical breakthrough in cracking the ''genetic code''. By the 1970s, [[molecular genetics]]' research tools could also be used for [[genetic engineering]].  In 1975, philosopher of science Hilary Putnam famously resurrected scientific realism with his ''no miracles'' argument, whereby the best scientific theories' predictive successes would appear miraculous if those theories were not at least ''approximately'' true about reality as it exists in and of itself beyond human perception.  Antirealist arguments were formulated in response.

===Revival of realism===
{{main|Scientific realism}}
By rejecting all variants of positivism via its focus on sensations rather than realism, [[Karl Popper]] asserted his commitment to scientific realism, merely via the necessary uncertainty of his own [[falsificationism]].   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (London: Routledge, 2003 [1963]), {{ISBN|0-415-28594-1}}, quote: "Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories—the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences—are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.)  Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of empiricism===
{{main|Constructive empiricism}}
[[Bas van Fraassen]]'s (1980)&lt;ref&gt;van Fraassen, Bas C., 1980, ''The Scientific Image'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; project of [[constructive empiricism]] focuses on belief in the domain of the observable, so for this reason it is described as a form of instrumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/ Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s philosophy the '''Intermediate zone''' refers to a dangerous and misleading transitional [[spirituality|spiritual]] state between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar notions can be found in mystical literature, such as "the astral plane" and "the hall of illusion."&lt;ref&gt;http://singingmountain.org/y2004jul15.html Paul Brunton on the Intermediate Zone - The Source of Psychic Delusion and the Subtle Ego&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theosophist]] [[William Quan Judge|W. Q. Judge]] used the similar notion of "astral intoxication".&lt;ref name="Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge"&gt;[http://www.theosophical.ca/VernalBlooms.htm#astral Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aurobindo==

===Original use===
The Intermediate Zone is first described in a letter to a disciple in the early 1930s. It was then published in 1933 in ''[[The Riddle of this World]]'', a small booklet that includes several essays. The letter later appeared in ''[[Letters on Yoga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga'', Part 3, Section 3 "Experiences of the Inner and the Cosmic Consciousness", Subsection 5, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of copies have been posted on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greylodge.org"&gt;[http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141007/http://greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter but similar reference to a misleading intermediate consciousness, but without the distinguishing qualifier "zone", is also found in some of the later strata of ''[[The Synthesis of Yoga]]'' which dates to the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', fifth edition, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, {{ISBN|81-7058-615-1}} p.283 - "Another error that has to be guarded against is...to take some higher intermediate consciousness or even any kind of supernormal consciousness for the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|supermind]]. To reach supermind it is not enough to go above the ordinary movements of the human mind; it is not enough to receive a greater light, a greater power, a greater joy or to develop capacities of knowledge, sight, effective will that surpass the normal range of the [[human|human being]]. All light is not the light of the spirit, still less is all light the light of the supermind; the mind, the vital, the physical itself have lights of their own, as yet hidden, which can be very inspiring, exalting, informative, powerfully executive..." - for the date see "note on the text",  pp.915-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greylodge.org"/&gt;

==William Q. Judge - Astral intoxication==
In his posthumously published book, ''Vernal Blooms'', Theosophist [[William Quan Judge]] (1851-1896) describes the dangers of "astral intoxication". He asserts that the [[astral plane]], which is the same as that of our psychic senses, has endless powers of delusion. It has to be well understood before the student can stay there long without danger. He states that phenomena, such as astral lights, moments of peace and revelation, do not indicate spiritual advancement. To regard every picture seen in the [[astral light]] as a spiritual experience is like becoming drunk. Such indulgence only results in becoming satiated with a store of illusory appearances. True progress is dependent upon purity of motive, and conquest of known or ascertainable defects.&lt;ref name="Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge"/&gt;

The dangers of astral intoxication or delusion are greatest for the person who revolves selfishly around himself. This may happen when one lacks the support and company of other sincere seekers. One 
{{quote|...must first dispel the inner darkness before trying to see into the darkness without; we must know ourselves before knowing things extraneous to ourselves.&lt;ref name="Vernal Blooms by W.Q.Judge"/&gt;}}

==Paul Brunton==
[[Paul Brunton]] included Sri Aurobindo's term of the "Intermediate Zone" as a name for a psychological and immature mystical level of delusion and subtle ego.&lt;ref&gt;''The Notebooks of Paul Brunton'' (Published in 1989; 16 volumes) - Volume 11: THE SENSITIVES - ch.12. THE INTERMEDIATE ZONE - online text at {{cite web |url=http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317054907/http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/ |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunton uses several terms, such as astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion. Once there, egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, the emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, the imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. If a person then falls victim to spiritual error regarding this state, the result is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and wild imagination. Brunton considered this a major factor in explaining the human wreckage found on the spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/16/12 The Intermediate Zone - Notebooks of Paul Brunton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720012809/http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/notebooks/16/12 |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the film|Intermedio (film)}}

The '''intermedio''' {{IPA-it|interˈmɛːdjo|}} (also '''intromessa''', '''introdutto''', '''tramessa''', '''tramezzo''', '''intermezzo'''), in the [[Italian Renaissance]], was a theatrical  performance or spectacle with [[Renaissance music|music]] and often dance which was performed between the acts of a play to celebrate special occasions in Italian [[noble court|courts]].  It was one of the important predecessors to [[opera]], and an influence on other forms like the English court [[masque]].  Weddings in ruling families and similar state occasions were the usual occasion for the most lavish intermedi, in cities such as [[Florence]] and [[Ferrara]].  Some of the best documentation of intermedi comes from weddings in the [[Medici]] family, in particular the 1589 Medici wedding (between [[Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Christina of Lorraine]] and [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]), which featured what was undoubtedly both the most spectacular set of intermedi, and the best known, thanks to no fewer than 18 contemporary published festival books and sets of [[old master print|prints]] that were financed by the Grand Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Reed &amp; Wallace:205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermedi were written and performed from the late 15th century through the 17th century, although the peak of development of the genre was in the late 16th century.  After 1600 the form merged with opera, for the most part, though intermedi continued to be used in non-musical plays in certain settings (for example in academies), and also continued to be performed between the acts of operas.

==Development==
The first intermedii were  not in Florence but in [[Ferrara]] at the end of the 15th century between the five acts of plays by the classical authors [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Writing of the "intermezzi" at the wedding of [[Lucrezia Borgia]] in 1502, [[Isabella d'Este]] said that they were more interesting than the boring ''commedia'', "a remark destined to be often repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrara intermezzi at this period were short and without a unifying theme; they included choruses, recitations and ''[[moresca]]'' dances.  But by 1513 there was a unifying [[allegory]], explained at the end.  It was for Florentine public celebrations that Intermedii came into their own; several were organised by [[Machiavelli]] when he was part of the government of the [[Republic of Florence]] in the early 16th century, and the returning Medici adopted a policy of keeping the aristocracy occupied by involving them in productions.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

As the intermedio developed in the 16th century, it grew more and more elaborate, often becoming a "play within a play"; for example during a five-act play, an intermedio would consist of four parts, which might be presented as a four-part metaphor of time passing in the play.  This stage begins with ''Il commodo'', from the Medici wedding in [[Florence]] of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and [[Eleanor of Toledo]] in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0189 Festival Book online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the four parts were morning, noon, afternoon, and night, represented with an elaborate mechanical artificial sun, with singing and dancing appropriate to each time.  Some critics of the time noted that the intermedi had become so elaborate that the play had begun to serve as intermedi to the intermedi.

==Mature intermedio==
Originally intermedi had used the sets already on the stage from the main play, typically fairly simple ones for a comedy, with a few extra pieces, but later they had their own sets, which a mythological subject required to be more elaborate.  [[Vasari]]'s production for yet another Medici wedding in 1565 "embodied stupendous advances in engineering technique" with all the elaborate movements of scenery done without a curtain in full view of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Strong:134-6&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Roy Strong]]: "the designs for the 1589 intermezzi are crucial, for they are the earliest mass-disseminated illustrations of what became a norm throughout Europe for theatrical visual experience for the next three hundred years, the [[proscenium arch]] behind which receded ranks of side wings, the vista closed by a back-shutter."&lt;ref&gt;Strong:140&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the form acquired a tradition and cohesiveness that allowed it to stand on its own, and it was thus a logical development to combine the existing features with sung, acted parts, and be absorbed into the new artform of opera, which also drew from the traditions of [[monody]] and [[madrigal comedy]]. [[Jacopo Peri]], the composer of [[Dafne]], the first opera, was one of the composers, and almost certainly performers, in the 1589 Medici intermezzi, and the librettist for both, [[Ottavio Rinuccini]], seems to have recycled in ''Dafne'' some of the material from the 1589 Delos scene (illustrated at top).

"Festival books", produced as souvenirs of lavish festivities, contain detailed descriptions of many important intermedi, such as those for the Medici wedding of 1589,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html Album of engravings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175205/http://www.ursusbooks.com/item110358.html |date=2011-07-17 }}, showing several of the sets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0205 British Library festival book online text]&lt;/ref&gt; for which 286 costumes were made.  Although music written specially for this occasion survives (see discography below), this is usually not the case, and music written for other occasions, for example [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s and instrumental pieces, was often used in intermedi.  The subject matter of the intermedio was usually a [[mythology|mythological]] or [[pastoral]] story, which could be told in [[mime artist|mime]], by costumed singers or actors, or by [[dance]], or any combination of these.  There was invariably a political message, even if this was limited to general glorification of the ruling family; at times more specific messages were intended.  Some thematic connection with the main play might be made, though intermedii could be repeated with different plays from the one they were written for.  

Numerous drawings and engravings of the stage sets survive, as well as texts of the libretti and descriptions of the music and action; the 1589 Medici intermezzi were especially well recorded, and "were to be the fount of Italian [[baroque]] scenography as well as influencing the development of the stage north of the Alps, above all the Stuart court [[masque]]s designed by [[Inigo Jones]]".&lt;ref&gt;Strong:136&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual content in terms of staging, music, instrumentation, presence of singers, actors, dancers, or mime was highly variable throughout the period, and sometimes all of these features were present.  The 1589 intermedi were performed in the recently completed theatre in the [[Uffizi Palace]] before an audience of about three thousand, and three further performances were given some days after the end of the wedding festivities. 
Further significant sets of Medici intermedi were produced for the weddings in 1600 of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Marie de' Medici]], and then in 1608 of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II]] and a [[Habsburg]] princess, [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Maria Magdalena of Austria]]. However the 1600 celebrations also included a portent of things to come in the form of performances of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'', the earliest surviving example of the form.

==Music of the Medici intermedi==
[[Image:La pellegrina 1589 - Intermedio 1 - L'armonia delle sfere.jpg|thumb|Another of the 1589 intermedi: number 1: Harmony descends to earth]]
Of the various intermedi that were performed, only the music to some parts of ''Il commodo''  (1539) and, through a 1591 printed edition by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]], an almost complete version of ''[[The Pilgrim Woman|La Pellegrina]]'' (1589) are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;liner noters to Sempé, "La Pellegrina", 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539 most of the pieces are in four and five parts so much of this music is suitable for domestic playing. The 1589 music is very different being largely big set pieces for 6, 12, 18 or even 30 parts; 41 instrumentalists were required in all, some hidden around the stage as there was not room for them all in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller scale pieces are often difficult florid [[monody]] of the [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]] ''new music'' variety.

Of the surviving intermedi only two numbers were ''[[a cappella]]'', (not counting the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s which were sung at the banquet in 1539 which of course are not intermedi).  This means we have surviving descriptions of precise instrumentation.

Classical humanist dramatic theory says a play should have action taking place during one entire day.  These intermedi do not follow what were believed to be the classical instructions, having an overture item, ''Vattene almo riposo'', and a night time ending for tenor voice accompanied by four [[sackbut]]s and an extra [[coda (music)|coda]] the [[bacchanale]], ''Baccho, Baccho, E U O E''.

==Similar forms outside Italy==

The similar form which developed in France at the same time was called the [[intermède]]; it was more reliant on dance than the Italian version.  The French court under [[Catherine de' Medici]] was also staging [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities of increasing lavishness]] – Catherine's granddaughter was the Medici bride in 1589.  The [[masque]] in England also had many similarities to the intermedio, although it did not originate as a "filler" between acts in a play in the same way.  The later 18th century [[intermezzo]] in opera showed a reversal of the Renaissance scheme; now a single short comic intermezzo was inserted between the acts of a heroic [[opera seria]].

==Shabbat and circumcision==
{{Judaism}}
The Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."  The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use.  The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the [[Israelites]] were living in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ({{lang-he|משכן}} [[transliteration|translit]]: ''mishkan'', "Place of [Divine] dwelling"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.

==The priests==
The Hebrew for priest is ''Kohen''; the ''Kohanim'' (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the ''Kohen Gadol'', the high priest.

The vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows ("Vita Mosis," iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the [[pomegranate]]s typified running water, and the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s denoted the music of the water. The [[ephod]] corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the [[zodiac]], which were denoted also by the twelve names on [[Priestly breastplate|the breastplate]]. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

[[Josephus]]' explanation is this:&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." iii. 7, § 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The [[ephod]] typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the [[girdle]] symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Menachot vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]] ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
{{See also|Significance of numbers of Judaism|Hebrew numerology}}

The number [[3 (number)|three]] was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three [[ell]]s in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,&lt;ref&gt;Num. vi. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; and in the invocation of God the word "holy" was repeated thrice.

The symbolism of the number [[4 (number)|four]] was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth&lt;ref&gt;comp. Job xxxvii. I Copied from wikipedia3; Isa. xi. 12; Ezek. vii. 2; I Chron. ix. 24; Dan. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number four connoted [[heaven]] as the throne of God.

The Holy of Holies was in the form of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.&lt;ref&gt;"De Opificio Mundi," pp.&amp;nbsp;13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number [[5 (number)|five]] typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.

The number [[6 (number)|six]] symbolizes imperfection.

The number [[7 (number)|seven]] was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the [[shmita|Sabbatical year]], and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.
The number 7 is the Divine number of completion.

The number [[8 (number)|eight]] symbolizes new beginnings. According to [[Kaballah]] in the [[Zohar]] the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.

The number [[10 (number)|ten]] symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the [[Ten Commandments]] were preserved.

The number [[12 (number)|twelve]], being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God.&lt;ref name="Maude-1862"&gt;[[#MAUDE 1862|Maude 1862]]: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8oMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;f=false 509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:31-38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:24-30|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]], which camped round about the Sanctuary.

The number [[13 (number)|thirteen]] symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.

The number [[18 (number)|eighteen]] is considered significant because the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "life" is חי (''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]''), which has a [[gematria|numerical value]] of 18.

The number [[26 (number)|twenty six]] symbolizes God's name.

==Metals and minerals==
[[Gold]] was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. vi. 11; Dan. xi. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver]] was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. i. 22; Jer. vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brass]] symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xxvi. 19; Jer. xv. 12; Job xl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. ii. 13; but comp. Ezek. xliii. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud salt symbolizes the [[Torah]], for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Soferim xv. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==

The Israelites used an [[indigo]]-colored dye called ''tekhelet''; this dye was likely made from snail ''[[murex trunculus]]''. This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as [[Tyrian purple]].

In the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) [[Blue in Judaism]] has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.

"Argaman" was the symbol of power, and of glory,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 6; Judges viii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; so that [[Alexander Balas]] robed Jonathan in purple,&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which was especially used to designate royal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20, xi. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tola'at" and "shani" ("[[scarlet (color)|scarlet]]," "[[crimson]]") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. xxxviii. 28; Josh. ii. 18, 21; Jer. iv. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Purification from sin was also symbolized by purple.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xvi. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shesh" ([[white]]) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification.&lt;ref&gt;Cant. v. 10; Dan. iv. 10, 14, 20; Zech. xiv. 5&lt;/ref&gt; White also symbolizes death.  In some cases, it can also symbolize life.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see [[Yellow badge]]).

==Festivals and holy days==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects shown on a gold goblet (2nd century CE) excavated in Rome]]
The Torah delineates three [[pilgrimage]] festivals, [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] (The Feasts of Weeks) and [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.

[[Passover]] celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.

The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the [[The Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Egyptian bondage]]. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 37c; Midrash Gen. Rabbah lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from [[slavery]].

A discussion of the meaning of [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks) and of [[Sukkot]], the Feast of [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacles]], is found in the entries on those subjects.

A discussion of symbolism inherent in [[Rosh Hashanah]] (The New Year) and [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] beheld an [[almond]]-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.

[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Amos viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead.&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xxii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings xiii. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. xx. 2&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeremiah wore a [[yoke]] upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;Jer. xxvii. 2-4, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel]] was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ezek. xxxvii. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'') who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the [[Levite]]s as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of [[grape]]s as an emblem of Israel.

The [[Star of David]] (''Magen David'') occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.

==Influence on Christian symbols==
The influence of Judaism upon [[Christian symbolism]] as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the [[Mishnah]] as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words "Mi she-'anah," which was included in the [[selihah]] at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany "Libera domine." This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] was regarded as a symbol of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.

Abraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of [[Elijah]] was believed to typify the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]], who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general [[resurrection]] from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and [[Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael|Hananiah]], [[Meshach|Mishael]], and [[Abednego|Azariah]] in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian [[sarcophagi]] contained artistic representations of the fall of man, [[Noah]] and the ark, scenes from the life of [[Moses]] in three variations, [[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

==The land of Zion==
{{Main|Land of Israel}}

[[Zion]] is a Biblical term that refers to [[Jerusalem]], and is the source for the modern term [[Zionism]].

[[File:Landslide animation San Matteo County.gif|upright=2|thumb| Computer simulation of a "slump" landslide in [[San Mateo County]], California (USA) in January 1997]]
Landslides are a major geologic hazard in many locations around the globe.  They are considered a mass-wasting process, the most common of which are [[debris flows]], [[mudslides|hill slides]], and [[Rock slide|rock falls]].&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;  These events can take place over the course of several years of creeping but powerful movement, or in a matter of a few devastatingly destructive moments. There are several factors relating to structural geology that correlate directly to landslide occurrences.  One major factor pertaining to landslides is rock strength.  Rock strength is defined by [[Stress-strain curve|stress/strain relationships]], [[pore fluid pressure]], and [[confining pressure]].&lt;ref name= Turner&gt;, A.K., Schuster, L.R. 1996.  Landslides: Investigation and Mitigation, Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  Stronger, more dense rocks are not as likely to be involved in a rock slide or landslide than porous less dense rocks that can be easily saturated with water.  In Utah the groundwater level is continually fluctuating, making the area particularly susceptible to landslides.&lt;ref name=Broch /&gt;  As water saturates the ground, making it softer and heavier, the stress/strain relationships experienced by the rocks increases considerably.  The strength of a rock can be defined by its [[Mohr's Circle|Mohr Circle]], and its corresponding [[Mohr–Coulomb theory|failure envelope]].  Once conditions are reached which place a rock over its failure envelope, it will experience deformation.

There are two main types of deformation which rocks undergo and both are pertinent to landslides.  If a rock behaves elastically and experiences micro fractures involved with tiny slip movements in the rock, cohesive strength is still somewhat maintained, and a slide might be temporarily prevented.  However, if a rock undergoes brittle deformation and breaks into pieces, a landslide is much more likely to occur.  Stress and strain conditions associated with rocks and their failure envelopes differ between rock types, but they have been studied extensively in laboratories because the implications of these data have relevance in every scope of geology.

==Landslide events in Utah==

A recent publication done by the Utah Geologic Survey reports the occurrence of over 22,000 landslide activities throughout the state over the recent geologic past.&lt;ref name="Utah Geologic Survey"&gt;{{cite web|author=Landslides: Events and Information |url=http://geology.utah.gov/utahgeo/hazards/landslide/index.htm |title=Utah Geological Survey &amp;#124; Landslides &amp; Rock Falls |publisher=Geology.utah.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been several major landslide events in Utah county over the last 25 years which have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and property loss.  Below is information pertaining to the [[Thistle, Utah]] landslide and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101103144603/http://geology.utah.gov/utahgeo/hazards/landslide/cedarhills0405/index.htm Cedar Hills, Utah] landslide (active).

==The Thistle Landslide==

The landslide in Thistle, Utah, (1983) caused over $200 million in damages and property loss.  Heavy snowfall, combined with a warm, wet spring triggered the landslide which eventually reached speeds of up to 3.5 feet per hour.  The slide was over 200 feet thick, 1000 feet wide, and over one mile long.  The slide eventually stopped when it collided with a large sandstone cliff at the base of the mountain.  The amount of material moved in the slide was enough to create a 200 foot tall dam which blocked off the Spanish Fork river, and created a large lake where the town of Thistle used to be.  It also inhibited railroad traffic and covered two major highways (US6 and US89).  The lake eventually drained off leaving the remnants of the town behind, which can still be seen in the canyons.  
[[File:Thistle 2010 from US6 rest area.JPG|thumb|left|Thistle 2010 from US6 rest area]]

Rock and soil samples involved in the Thistle landslide were collected and studied.  The main rock types are sandstone and limestone, and the soil is composed almost exclusively of quartz sand grains and clay minerals (illite).  [http://www.imwa.info/docs/imwa_2005/IMWA2005_072_Li.pdf Previous strength studies] performed on course-grained sandstone make it easy to see why the landslide was triggered.  Triaxial compression testing done for dry silty sandstone show cohesive strength integrity to 18.7 MPa, meaning that the rock will not fracture until these stress conditions are reached.  For a wet sample, similar to the conditions in Thistle, the cohesive strength integrity is reduced to 15.9 MPa.&lt;ref name=Broch&gt;Broch, E. 1979. Changes in rock strength by water. Proceedings of the IV. International Society of Rock Mechanics, Montreux, vol. 1, 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;  These data show that when silty sandstone is saturated, the rocks are more susceptible to breaking, which is one way landslides can be triggered.  With the porosity properties of silty sandstone, and the ability of clay-rich soil to absorb tremendous amounts of water, it is not surprising that Spanish Fork canyon has experienced several landslide events throughout its geologic history.    The thistle slide has reactivated several times since its main activity in 1983, and will continue to do so until the ideal landslide conditions created by the local weather patterns change.

==The Cedar Hills Landslide==
[[File:Cedar Hills Landslide.jpg|thumb|Homes Destroyed by Cedar Hills Landslide]]

In April 2005, an existing landslide was triggered in Cedar Hills, Utah.  The landslide area last moved in 1983, in conjunction with the same heavy winter and warm, wet spring conditions that triggered the Thistle slide.  The landslide is part of a larger, prehistoric landslide complex associated with the Manning Canyon Shale. The active landslide is approximately 375 feet long and 150 feet wide.  The rock and soil types associated with this event are clay and mud rich [[shale]].  Strength properties associated with wet vs. dry shale are similar to those of wet vs. dry sandstone. When shale is near the ground surface where the water content fluctuates, it weathers into a clay-rich soil where the added moisture reduces the rock strength and increasing the likelihood of a landslide event.&lt;ref name=Eeckhout&gt;Van Eeckhout E.M., 1976. The mechanism of strength reduction due to moisture in coal mine shales, International Journal of Rock Mechanics, Mining Sciences &amp; Geomechanical Abstract, vol. 13(2), 61-67&lt;/ref&gt;  Triaxial compression testing done on dry shale showed a mean effective stress failure above 15MPa.&lt;ref name=Eeckhout /&gt;  The Cedar Hills landslide was not as severe as the Thistle slide because the slope of the hill was not as steep, resulting in a lower normal stress.  Also, shale tends to have a higher compressive strength than sandstone, so the overburden did not have as great an influence on the shale.  Luckily for the residents of Cedar Hills, the slide has stopped for now, and hopefully will continue to be stagnant, though the geologic evidence shows that this is not likely.

Precautions were taken after the 2005 slide to reduce the stress on the hillside, including the construction of a retaining wall to reduce the effects of the vertical stress (sigma 1), and gravel drains to help remove water from the hillside to help rocks maintain cohesive strength.  These measures have been ineffective, as the slide has moved three times since 2005, eventually completely destroying the homes in the adjacent picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15900">The '''Late Ordovician Glaciation''' is the first part of the [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]]. It was centered on the Sahara region in late [[Ordovician]], about  440-460 Ma (million years ago).  The major glaciation during this period is widely considered to be the leading cause of the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]].&lt;ref name="end-Ordovician glaciation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delabroye|first=A.|author2=Vecoli, M. |title=The end-Ordovician glaciation and the Hirnantian Stage: A global review and questions about the Late Ordovician event stratigraphy|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|year=2010|pages=269–282|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.10.010|volume=98}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of this glaciation can be seen in places such as [[Morocco]], [[South Africa]], [[Libya]], and [[Wyoming]]. More evidence derived from isotopic data is that during the Late Ordovician, Tropical ocean temperatures were about 5&amp;nbsp;°C cooler than present day, this would have been a major factor that aided in the glaciation process.&lt;ref name="Magnitude and Duration"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finnegan|first=S.|title=The Magnitude and Duration of the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian Glaciation|journal=Science|year=2011|pages=903–906|doi=10.1126/science.1200803|volume=331|pmid=21273448}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Late Ordovician is the only glacial episode that appears to have coincided with a major mass extinction of nearly 61% of marine life.&lt;ref name="Mass Extinction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheehan|first=Peter M|title=The Late Ordovician Mass Extinction|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|date=1 May 2001|volume=29|issue=1|pages=331–364|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.331|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.331?journalCode=earth&amp;|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of peak ice sheet volume range from 50 to 250 million cubic kilometers, and its duration from 35 million to less than 1 million years.   There were also two peaks of glaciation.&lt;ref name="Magnitude and Duration" /&gt;   Also, glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere was minimal because a large amount of the land was in the southern hemisphere.

This evidence is further aided by the observation that both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C fall sharply at the beginning of the [[Silurian]].&lt;ref name="Bathymetric and Isotopic evidence" /&gt;
*The direction of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O shift can imply glacial-cooling and possibly increases in ice-volume, and the magnitude of this shift (+4‰) was extraordinary.  The direction and magnitude of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotopic indicator would require a sea-level fall of 100 meters and a drop of 10&amp;nbsp;°C in tropical ocean temperatures.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric and Isotopic evidence" /&gt;
*The shift in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C implies a change in the carbon cycle leading to more burial of carbon, or at the very least production of more carbon with the removal of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C in surface waters.  This decrease points toward a decrease in the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels which would have an inverse greenhouse effect, which would allow glaciation to occur more readily.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric and Isotopic evidence" /&gt;

=== Lithologic indicators ===
*Sedimentological data shows that Late Ordovician ice sheets glacierized the Al Kufrah Basin.  Ice sheets also probably formed continuous ice cover over North African and the Arabian Peninsula.  In all areas of North African where Early Silurian shale occurs, Late Ordovician glaciogenic deposits occur beneath, likely due to the [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] promoted in these basins.&lt;ref name="Evidence Al Kufrah"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heron|first=D. P.|author2=Howard, J. |title=Evidence for Late Ordovician Glaciation of Al Kufrah Basin, Libya|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|year=2010|pages=354–364|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2010.04.001|volume=58}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*From what we know about [[tectonic]] movement, the time span required to allow the southward movement of [[Gondwana]] toward the South Pole would have been too long to trigger this glaciation.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;   Tectonic movement tends to take several million years, but the scale of the glaciation seems to have occurred in less than 1 million years, but the exact time frame of glaciation ranges from less than 1 million years to 35 million years, so it could still be possible for tectonic movement to have triggered this glacial period.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;
*The sequence of the stratigraphic architecture of the [[Bighorn Dolomite]] (which represents end of the Ordovician period), is consistent with the gradual buildup of glacial ice.  The sequences of the Bighorn Dolomite display systematic changes in their component cycles, and the changes in these cycles are interpreted as being a change from a greenhouse climate to a transitional ice house climate.&lt;ref name="Bighorn Dolomite, Wyoming" /&gt;
*Although biostratigraphy dating the glacial deposits in Gondwana has been problematic, some evidence suggested an onset of glaciation as early as the [[Sandbian]] Stage (approximately 451-461 Ma).&lt;ref name="Bighorn Dolomite, Wyoming"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=S.

== Possible causes ==

=== Decreases in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
One of the factors that hindered glaciation was atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, which at the time were somewhere between 8 and 20 times pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref name=impacts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=A. D.|author2=Patzkowsky, M.E. |author3=Pollard, D. |title=The impact of paleogeography, pCO2, poleward ocean heat transport, and sea level change on global cooling during the Late Ordovician.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|year=2004|pages=59–74|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2003.12.019|volume=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During this time though, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are thought to have dropped significantly, which could have led to further glaciation, but the methods for the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during that time are not well known.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric and Isotopic evidence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenchley|first=P.J.|author2=J. D. |title=Bathymetric and isotopic evidence for a short-lived Late Ordovician glaciation in a greenhouse period|journal=Geology|year=1994|pages=295–298|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022&lt;0295:baiefa&gt;2.3.co;2|volume=22}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It could have been possible for glaciation to initiate with high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it would have depended highly on continental configuration.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

One theory is that the Katian large igneous province had basaltic flooding caused by high continental volcanic activity during that period. This would have released a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere but would have left behind basaltic plains replacing the granitic rock.  Basaltic rocks weather substantially faster than granitic rocks, which would quickly remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere to lower levels than pre-volcanic activity.&lt;ref name="Katian Large Igneous"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lefebvre|first=V. |author2=Servais, T. |author3=Francois, L. |author4=Averbuch, O.|title=Did a Katian large igneous province trigger the Late Ordovician glaciation? A hypothesis tested with a carbon cycle model.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|year=2010|pages=310–319|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.04.010 |volume=296}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea level change===
One of the possible causes for the temperature drop during this period is a drop in sea level.   Sea level must drop prior to the initiation of extensive ice sheets in order for it to be a possible trigger.   A drop in sea level allows more land to become available for ice sheet growth.  There is wide debate on the timing of sea level change, but there is some evidence that a sea level drop started before the [[Ashgillian]], which would have made it a contributing factor to glaciation.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

===Poleward ocean heat transport===
Ocean heat transport is a major driver in the warming of the poles, taking warm water from the equator and distributing it to higher latitudes.   A weakening of this heat transport may have allowed the poles to cool enough to form ice under high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

Unfortunately due to the paleogeographic configuration of the continents, global ocean heat transport is thought to have been stronger in the Late Ordovician,&lt;ref name="glaciation under high CO2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poussart|first=P.F|author2=Weaver, A.J. |author3=Bames, C.R. |title=Late Ordovician glaciation under high atmospheric CO2; a coupled model analysis|journal=Palaeoceanography|year=1999|volume=14|issue=4|pages=542–558|doi=10.1029/1999pa900021|bibcode=1999PalOc..14..542P}}&lt;/ref&gt; but research shows that in order for glaciation to occur, poleward heat transport had to be lower, which creates a discrepancy in what is known.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

===Paleogeography===
The possible setup of the paleogeography during the period from 460 Ma to 440 Ma falls in a range between the Caradocian and the Ashgillian. The choice of setup is important, because the Caradocian setup is more likely to produce glacial ice at high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and the Ashgillian is more likely to produce glacial ice at low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

The height of the land mass above sea level also plays an important role, especially after ice sheets have been established.  A higher elevation allows ice sheets to remain with more stability, but a lower elevation allows ice sheets to develop more readily.  The Caradocian is considered to have a lower surface elevation, and though it would be better for initiation during high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it would have a harder time maintaining glacial coverage.&lt;ref name="revised world maps"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scotese|first=C.R.|author2=McKerrow, W.S. |title=Revised world maps and introduction. In: Scotese, C.R., McKerrow, W.S. (Eds.), Palaeozoic Palaeogeography and Biogeography|journal=Geological Society of London Memoir|year=1990|volume=12|pages=1–21|doi=10.1144/gsl.mem.1990.012.01.01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbital parameters===
Orbital parameters may have acted in conjunction with some of the above parameters to help start glaciation.   The variation of the earth’s precession, and eccentricity, could have set the off the tipping point for initiation of glaciation.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;  The Orbit at this time is thought to have been in a cold summer orbit for the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt; This type of orbital configuration is a change in the [[Apsidal precession|orbital precession]] such that during the summer when the hemisphere is tilted toward the sun (in this case the earth) the earth is furthest away from the sun, and [[orbital eccentricity]] such that the orbit of the earth is more elongated which would enhance the effect of precession.

Coupled models have shown that in order to maintain ice at the pole in the southern hemisphere, the earth would have to be in a cold summer configuration.&lt;ref name="glaciation under high CO2" /&gt;  The glaciation was most likely to start during a cold summer period because this configuration enhances the chance of snow and ice surviving throughout the summer.&lt;ref name=impacts /&gt;

== End of the event ==

=== Causes ===
The cause for the end of the Late Ordovician Glaciation is a matter of intense research, but evidence shows that it may have occurred abruptly, as Silurian strata marks a significant change from the glacial deposits left during the Late Ordovician.  Most evidence points to an abrupt change rather than a gradual change.&lt;ref name="deglaciation sequence" /&gt;

==== Ice collapse ====
One of the possible causes for the end of this glacial event is during the glacial maximum, the ice reached out too far and began collapsing on itself. The ice sheet initially stabilized once it reached as far north as  [[Ghat, Libya]] and developed a large proglacial fan-delta system. A glaciotectonic fold and thrust belt began to form from repeated small-scale fluctuations in the ice. The glaciotectonic fold and thrust belt eventually led to ice sheet collapse and retreat of the ice to south of Ghat. Once stabilized south of Ghat, the ice sheet began advancing north again. This cycle slowly shrank more south each time which lead to further retreat and further collapse of glacial conditions. This recursion allowed the melting of the ice sheet, and rising sea level. This hypothesis is supported by glacial deposits and large land formations found in Ghat, Libya which is part of the [[Murzuq Basin]].&lt;ref name="deglaciation sequence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreau|first=J.|title=The Late Ordovician deglaciation sequence of the SW|journal=Basin Research|year=2011|pages=449–477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;====
{{Expand Section|date=November 2012}}
As the Ice sheets began to increase the weathering of the basaltic and silicate rocks decreased, which caused CO2 levels to rise again, this in turned helped push deglaciation.  This deglaciation cause the basaltic weathering to start back up which caused glaciation to occur again.&lt;ref name="CO2 exit glaciation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seth A Young|first=M. R.|title=Did Changes in atmospheric CO2 coincide with latest Ordovician glacial-interglacial cycles?|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|year=2012|pages=376–388|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.02.033|volume=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Late Ordovician Glaciation coincided with the second largest of the 5 major [[extinction events]], known as the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event]].  This period is the only known glaciation to occur alongside of a mass extinction event.  The extinction event consisted of two discrete pulses.   The first pulse of extinctions is thought to have taken place because of the rapid cooling, and increased oxygenation of the water column.  This first pulse was the larger of the two and caused the extinction of most of the marine animal species that existed in the shallow and deep oceans.   The second phase of extinction was associated with strong sea level rise, and due to the atmospheric conditions, namely oxygen levels being at or below 50% of present-day levels, high levels of anoxic waters would have been common.  This anoxia would have killed off many of the survivors of the first extinction pulse.  In all the extinction event of the Late Ordovician saw a loss of 85% of marine animal species and 26% of animal families.&lt;ref name="Sulfidic driver"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammarlund|first=E.

The [[DuPont Experimental Station]] is the main research and development site of [[DuPont]] and [[Chemours]]. It is a major component of the [[DuPont Historic Corridor]], a section of [[Delaware Route 141]] that traces the history of both the [[Du Pont family]] and the DuPont company. The site map is shown in the Figure and the buildings are numbered. The map is not fixed in time in that not all of the building shown existed in the same time frame. Some were demolished before other were built.

The site was initiated along the banks of the [[Brandywine River]] so the lowest numbers are in the lower left of the map. Expansion has taken place toward the upper right, slowly displacing the DuPont Country Club, so those are the more modern buildings and the more recent history of the site. Each of the business units of the company have had research facilities at the Experimental Station, so the inventions listed below reflect the nature of the research carried out in each building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.dupont.com/Career_Center/en_US/assets/downloads/duPont_r_d_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysers ===

The &lt;u&gt;Microtox Model 500&lt;/u&gt; is a laboratory-based [[photometer]] that measures [[acute toxicity]]. This analyser is a temperature-controlled, self-calibrating [[biosensor]] measuring system that uses the bioluminescence of ''Allivibrio fischeri'' to determine the toxicity of contaminated water, or elutriates of contaminated soils and sediments.&lt;ref name = M500&gt;[http://www.modernwater.com/assets/downloads/Brochures/MW_Factsheet_MicroM500_LOWRES.pdf “Modern Water Microtox M500 Factsheet”], Modern Water. N.D. Retrieved on 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Microtox Continuous Toxicity Monitor (CTM)&lt;/u&gt; is a site-specific Microtox analyser that continuously measures the toxicity of a water source and provides results instantly. This fully automatic analyser has a broad detection range that can identify several thousand contaminants simultaneously whether or not there is knowledge of the source of contamination. This device has the ability to run continuously for up to 4 weeks, and is easy to operate and maintain.&lt;ref name = "CTM Fact sheet"&gt;[http://www.modernwater.com/assets/downloads/Brochures/MW_Factsheet_Microtox%20CTM_LOWRES.pdf “Modern Water Microtox CTM Factsheet”], Modern Water. N.D. Retrieved on 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;u&gt;DeltaTox II&lt;/u&gt; is a portable instrument that can be used to conduct [[acute toxicity]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) testing. Also known as the portable version of the Microtox Model 500, this device provides simple testing, uses small sample sizes, and is a cost effective approach to analyzing water samples. This sensitive and rapid testing analyser has the ability to detect [[microbial]] contamination, as well as more than 2,700 different chemicals.&lt;ref name = Delta&gt;[http://www.modernwater.com/assets/downloads/Brochures/MW_Factsheet_DeltaTox%20II_LOWRES.pdf “Modern Water DeltaTox II Fact Sheet”], Modern Water. N.D. Retrieved on 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reagent and Solutions ===

==== Microtox Model 500 and Microtox FX ====
The shelf life for the Acute Reagent is two years and for the solutions is three years when stored properly.&lt;ref name = MWO&gt;[http://www.coastalbio.com/images/Acute_Overview.pdf “Modern Water Microtox Acute Toxicity Overview”], Modern Water. N.D. Retrieved on 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Microtox Acute Reagent&lt;/u&gt; is a [[freeze-dried]] culture of ''Allivibrio fischeri'' that is reconstituted prior to testing. It is recommended that the reagent be used within three hours of reconstitution. The sensitivity of the [[reagent]] may become altered after the recommended time period.&lt;ref name = MWO/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Microtox Osmotic Adjustment Solution (MOAS)&lt;/u&gt; is a nontoxic solution that is made up of 22% [[Sodium Chloride]] ([[NaCl]]) and Ultra Pure Water. This solution is added to a sample to adjust the [[osmotic pressure]] to approximately 2% [[NaCl]].&lt;ref name = MWO/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Reconstitution Solution&lt;/u&gt; consists of specially prepared, nontoxic Ultra Pure Water.&lt;ref name = MWO/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Diluent&lt;/u&gt; is a nontoxic solution that is made up of 2% [[NaCl]] in Ultra Pure Water. This solution is used for diluting the sample and the [[reagent]], and also provides osmotic protection that is required by ''Allivibrio fischeri''.&lt;ref name = MWO/&gt;&lt;ref name = WAECY&gt;[https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/92e04.pdf “Review and Evaluation of Microtox Test for Freshwater Sediment”] Washington State Department of Ecology. November 1992. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Preparation of Samples ===

Microtox can be applied to a variety of matrices including [[drinking water]], [[stormwater runoff]], [[effluent]], industrial discharges, soils and sediments.&lt;ref name ="sediment"/&gt; Most samples do not require special preparation before testing besides adjusting the salinity to 2%.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; However, samples that have certain characteristics, such as high [[turbidity]] levels, may require special preparation.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; If samples require a [[salinity]] adjustment to lower the [[salinity]], this can be accomplished by adding an appropriate amount of Microtox Osmotic Adjusting Solution to dilute the sample. For example, adding 0.1 mL of MOAS to 1 mL of sample would result in a dilution of 90.9% of the original concentration.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; If a greater [[salinity]] is required, this can be accomplished by dissolving solid [[sodium chloride]] in the sample to achieve a final [[salinity]] of 2% for the protection of ''Allivibrio fischeri''.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; Highly turbid samples that contain [[particulates|particulate matter]] will be required to settle before the test can be conducted.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; Particulate matter in the sample can interfere with bioluminescence by absorbing light and give misleading test results. Interference of luminescence can also occur with samples which are highly colored (particularly red, brown or black).&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; It may be necessary to [[centrifuge]] samples to obtain an acceptable clarity for the test.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; If samples contain [[chlorine]], this may alter the toxicity to ''Allivibrio fischeri'' and also give misleading results. The samples can be de-chlorinated using a [[sodium thiosulphate]] and [[deionized water]] solution that does not affect test results.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt; Ideally, the [[pH]] of samples should not be modified since it is preferable to test each sample at the original [[pH]] level. However, if it is necessary to adjust the [[pH]] this should be done by adding either [[sodium hydroxide]] solution or [[hydrochloric acid]] to the sample.&lt;ref name = sdix/&gt;

Unlike water samples, soil and sediment samples are not homogenous.&lt;ref name = SPT&gt;[http://www.microlan.nl/uploads/files/applicaties/Microtox_solid_phase_method.pdf “Solid-Phase Test (SPT)”] Azur Environmental. 1998. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is difficult to obtain representative samples from such matrices. Toxic substances are likely to bind to particulate matter, and the extent to which toxic materials bind depends on the composition of the particles. For example, smaller particles such as clay tend to tightly bind to chemicals, acting like [[ion exchange resins]].&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;&lt;ref name = SPT/&gt; Microtox tests for sediment and soil differ in the way the matrix is prepared for contact with ''Allivibrio fischeri''. To obtain a representative soil or sediment sample, it is necessary to conduct an elutriate test. Sediment elutriates can be prepared through extraction with either distilled water, saline water, or an organic solvent such as [[methylene chloride]], or [[hexane]].&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt; To run an elutriate test a soil sample is mixed with an extractant for a period of time, then allowed to settle and a sample is taken from the extract. If particulate matter is in the sample that was collected, it may be necessary to [[centrifuge]] the sample for optimal clarity. Additionally, the pore water of sediments can be collected by centrifugation and tested without extraction.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

=== Procedures ===

There are five major Microtox tests including the Basic Test, the 100% Test, the Solid Phase Test, the Comparison Test, and the Inhibition Test. Of these five tests, three are used for sediment and soil testing including the Basic Test, the 100% Test and the Solid-Phase Test.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt; All of these versions follow the same general method of reconstituting the ''Allivibrio fischeri'' [[reagent]] in the Reconstitution Solution. Corrections are made for [[salinity]] and particulate matter, then the bacteria are exposed to the sample solution depending on the methods of the particular test. The light output of the bacteria is measured using a [[photometer]] after five and 15 minutes from exposing the bacteria to the samples.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt; The light measured directly correlates to the toxicity of the sample, producing data that allows for the calculation of [[EC50]] or IC50s, or other ECxx and ICxx values.&lt;ref name = basic&gt;Microtox Acute Toxicity Basic Test Procedures Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Acute Toxicity Basic Test&lt;/u&gt; is a procedure that measures the relative [[acute toxicity]] of a sample. This test is the best protocol for testing samples of unknown toxicity, a high level of toxicity, or when the test results are required to provide the highest confidence and precision. This test consists of two controls and eight sample dilutions in duplicate.&lt;ref name = basic/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Acute Toxicity 100% Test&lt;/u&gt; is a procedure that tests the sample at 100% sample concentration and as a result includes adding [[reagent]] solution directly to the sample.&lt;ref name = hundred&gt;Microtox Acute Toxicity 100% Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This test is used for samples that are expected to have a low level of toxicity and is generally used as an environmental screening tool. Compared to the Basic Test it is more sensitive to operator technique, and as a result may be less precise.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Acute Toxicity Solid-Phase Test&lt;/u&gt; is a procedure that allows the test organism to come in direct contact with the solid sample as particulate in an aqueous suspension. Normally, this test provides results indicating equal or higher toxicity when compared to eluate or pore water tests of the same sample.&lt;ref name = SP&gt;Microtox Acute Toxicity Solid-Phase Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to either equal or increased [[bioavailability]] resulting from direct contact. This test is subject to several sources of interference of luminescence including loss of bacteria from effects other than toxicity such as filtration of the sample; absorption of light due to color; and scattering of light due to [[turbidity]].&lt;ref name = SP/&gt; Corrections can be made by testing a sample of similar particle composition that is known to not be toxic. This test consists of two controls and 13 sample dilutions in duplicate.&lt;ref name = SP/&gt; The Solid-Phase Test exposes the bacteria in such a way that is not always possible with pore water and elutriate.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Acute Toxicity Comparison &amp; Inhibition Tests&lt;/u&gt; are the best procedures for testing samples with a low level of toxicity when an ECxx can not be determined using the Basic Test.&lt;ref name = CIT&gt;Microtox Acute Toxicity Comparison &amp; Inhibition Test. Azur Environmental. 1995. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; These protocols are recommended for testing [[waste water treatment plant]] effluent, [[stormwater runoff]], [[drinking water]], pore water, and eluate.&lt;ref name = CIT/&gt; These tests use multiple replicates of a sample at a single concentration. Similar to the Basic Test, the Comparison Test protocol uses zero time light readings used for correcting the timed light level readings. The Inhibition Test procedure does not use zero time light readings and therefore, can not use a correction factor for the timed light level readings. Both of these tests consists of five controls and five replicates of the sample at a single concentration.&lt;ref name = CIT/&gt;

=== Microtox Omni Software ===
The Microtox Omni Software was developed by Azur Environmental and allows users of the Microtox Model 500 Analyser to run tests, visualize data, calculate statistics and generate reports.&lt;ref name = omni&gt;[http://www.sdix.com/uploadedFiles/Content/Products/Water_Quality_Tests/MicrotoxOmni-Software-forWindows.pdf “Azur Environmental MicrotoxOmni Software for Windows 95/98/NT”] Azur Environmental. 1999. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This program contains a set of templates for all of the commonly used toxicity tests and allows you to modify or add to the provided templates. The modification of these templates allows for the production of new test formats not originally included with the software.&lt;ref name = omni/&gt; The test templates that are included in this software define all of the parameters for a particular test method. This program calculates the most efficient way of setting up the desired test on the Model 500 Analyser. A test tutor is also included with Microsoft Omni that gives listed instructions on how to set up and run the test of interest.&lt;ref name = omni/&gt; This software allows users to load files from previous versions of the Microtox DOS Software and also gives users the ability to save new data in that original format. A [[database]] is included in this software that grants users to access data from a number of other users and test sites, allowing for a comparison of data and trend changes over time. Microtox Omni can be used with any number of [[databases]].&lt;ref name = omni/&gt;

== Application ==

Microtox has a variety of environmental and industrial applications. Common applications are for testing the toxicity of both marine and freshwater, as well as sediments for pesticides and other inorganic and organic chemicals.

&lt;u&gt;Drinking Water:&lt;/u&gt; Microtox is used to test drinking water sources in many areas where either accidental or deliberate contamination is possible. Toxic contaminants in drinking water are indicated by a change in the color or intensity of light, or by a change in the rate of oxygen use.&lt;ref name = M500/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Lakes and Rivers:&lt;/u&gt; Microtox is used to test the toxicity of lake and river sediments contaminated by metals or nonspecific contaminants. The Solid-Phase test is used for sediments, while either the Basic test or the 100% test is used for pore water.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Sediment testing:&lt;/u&gt; Microtox is used to test and evaluate the toxicity of various marine and freshwater sediments contaminated by metals and organics. Aqueous extracts of contaminated soils, drilling muds, and sludge. Microtox data may be used to establish apparent effects threshold (AET), sediment quality standards and used for [[NPDES]] permits, as well as [[Superfund]] cleanup levels.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Industrial:&lt;/u&gt; This bioassay is used in the assessment of the toxicity of complex industrial effluent sources. It is a cost effective way for monitoring and testing large numbers of samples.
Microtox can also be applied as an [[early warning system]] (EWS) and aid in detecting the presence of toxic materials, as well as predict the outcomes of other bioassays and tests.&lt;ref name = ch&gt;Qureshi AA, Bulich AA, Isenberg DL. 1998. “Microtox Toxicity Test Systems - Where They Stand Today”. Microscale Testing in Aquatic Toxicology: Advances, Techniques, and Practices. Chapter 13: 185-195. Retrieved 28 May 2014. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WUx9ZDHsYoAC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=interpretation+of+microtox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vfi-FK5OOu&amp;sig=6SOHfjOczGLEmqhyY23UcKejJBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lf5iU6vWOYaAogTBh4DoBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=interpretation%20of%20microtox&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microtox has also been applied to animal testing as an [[in vitro]] alternative.

== Ecological Relevance ==
Numerous studies and published data comparing Microtox results with toxicity values for fish, crustaceans and algae have found a positive correlation.&lt;ref name=leeder&gt;[http://www.leederconsulting.com/toxicology_services_microtox.html “Microtox Toxicity Testing”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819082200/http://www.leederconsulting.com/toxicology_services_microtox.html |date=2006-08-19 }} Leeder Consulting. N.D. Retrieved 28 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, others have pointed out that the effect of luminosity on the survival of organisms is unknown. Concerns have also been expressed regarding the use of sediment extracts and not the sediment itself. It is possible that only water-soluble contaminants will be tested for, and therefore may not be representative of the full range of contaminants present in the sediment. Extracts may also remove contaminants that are not bioavailable. This could lead to an over or under estimation of contaminants and their biological effects.&lt;ref name = WAECY/&gt;

A '''naked butler '''is a popular type of entertainment used at [[Bachelorette party|hen parties]] and for corporate entertainment. It was introduced into the UK in the early 2000s and is now popular across the USA, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

==Attire==

===Naked butler===
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Naked butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
The standard attire for a naked butler is only an [[apron]] or [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]], [[cuff]]s, [[detachable collar]] and [[bow tie]]. It is seen as a more conservative entertainment option to hiring a [[male stripper]] for a [[Bachelorette party]] as it can be suitable for a broader range of guests.

===Topless waiter===

In this case the apron will be replaced with smart black trousers. This option may be more commonly used during corporate entertainment where the attire needs to be smarter and the exposing of a butlers naked bottom is not appropriate.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A naked butler on X factor, July 2011.jpg|thumb|223x223px]] --&gt;
Naked butlers have become a popular [[gimmick]] on television shows in the UK and this is demonstrated by appearances on TV shows including ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|the X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1806642/x-factor-half-naked-butlers-endless-booze-and-hot-tub-romps-what-really-happened-at-the-x-factor-contestants-party/|title=Boozy wannabes have X-rated romp in boot camp hot tub as  Simon warns some have blown their chances|date=2016-09-18|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the role and job of a naked butler was discussed in the documentary ''Going to work Naked'' on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;Star 7th February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, naked butlers were part of an international news feature after being hired by a retirement home as part of the resident's wish program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/16988603.milton-lodges-hunks-in-trunks-visit-goes-international/|title=Care home's Hunks in Trunks visit goes international|website=Gazette|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Donald Neil MacCormick''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|QC|FBA|FRSE}} (27 May 1941 – 5 April 2009) was a Scottish [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] and politician.  He was [[Regius Professor]] of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1972 until 2008.  He was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] 1999–2004, member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]], and officer of the [[Scottish National Party]].

== Life and Academic Career ==
MacCormick was born in [[Glasgow]] on 27 May 1941, the son of one of the SNP's founders, [[John MacCormick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/professor-sir-neil-maccormick-legal-academic-and-politician-1-1033072 |title=Professor Sir Neil MacCormick, Legal academic and politician |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]]. He graduated [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in Philosophy and English Literature at the [[University of Glasgow]], before benefiting from a [[Snell exhibition|Snell Exhibition]] and taking the BA in Jurisprudence at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7GJAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mqMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4426%2C2497348 |title=Glasgow style and Oxford Manners |first=Neil |last=MacCormick |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=10 |date=15 February 1965 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, MacCormick came under the influence of Professor [[H. L. A. Hart]], and developed an interest in legal philosophy. In 1982 he was awarded the research degree of LLD by the [[University of Edinburgh]].

MacCormick was a lecturer in Jurisprudence at the School of Law, University of Dundee [which was attached to University of St Andrews at that time] from 1965-67. Following this, he was a Fellow and Tutor in Jurisprudence, Balliol College, Oxford 1968-1972, and thereafter held the Regius Chair of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He was also Leverhulme Research Professor at Edinburgh from 1997–1999, and from 2004-2008. In addition, he held the position of Dean of Law Faculty between 1973–76 and was sometime Provost of the Faculty Group of Law and Social Science, and Vice-Principal for International Affairs.

Professor MacCormick retired from the Regius Chair on 1 February 2008 after completing 36 years as Professor (and later Senior Professor) at the University of Edinburgh. He was accorded with the honour of a series of lectures in his name by the University's [[University of Edinburgh School of Law|School of Law]], and delivered the School of Law's opening Tercentenary Lecture, introduced by former Lord President [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]], on 18 January 2007. He gave his final lecture as Regius Professor, entitled 'Just Law', on Monday 28 January 2008. He continued thereafter in his role as President of the International Association for [[Philosophy of Law]] and Social Philosophy.

He was president of the [[International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12454642.Law_professor_still_doing_his_job_justice/|title=Law professor still doing his job justice |last=Dorsey|first=Kristy |date=10 December 2007 |work=The Herald |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacCormick was a member of the [[Broadcasting Council for Scotland]], of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], of the Research Council of the [[European University Institute]], and of the [[European Science Foundation]], as well as of various government departmental committees inquiring into matters of public concern.

== Political career ==
MacCormick stood for the SNP in the [[Edinburgh Pentlands (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], coming in fourth place both times. He stood for [[Argyll and Bute (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll and Bute]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] and came second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/016.stm |title=Vote 2001: Results &amp; Constituencies: Argyll &amp; Bute |work=BBC News |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP's conference as a candidate for the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/179343.stm |title=SNP chooses Euro candidates |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 September 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament]], taking a leave of absence from the University of Edinburgh. Professor MacCormick was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] from 2002–3, drafting the proposed [[Constitutional Treaty for the European Union]]. He was voted Scottish Euro MP of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] Awards, and retired from elected office in 2004 to complete his Leverhulme Research Professorship at Edinburgh.

He was elected vice president of the SNP in 1999 and remained in the position until 2004.&lt;ref name="BBC 6 Apr2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7985544.stm |title=Prominent SNP figure dies aged 67 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|newly elected SNP-led]] [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6704673.stm |title=Advocate becomes Salmond adviser |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic works ==
MacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on Law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as ''Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy'' (1984), ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' (1978), ''Rhetoric and The Rule of Law'' (2005) and ''Institutions of Law'' (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. ''Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory'' answers many of the [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]]ian critiques of the [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]]ian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two. His final book was ''Practical Reason in Law and Morality'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Natural Law, Practical Reason and Autonomous Persons — A Critical Review of Neil MacCormick: Practical Reason in Law and Morality. |first=Jes |last=Bjarup |journal=[[Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie]] (ARSP) (Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy) |volume=95 |number=3 |date=2009 |pages=428–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
In 1999, MacCormick was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] 'honoris causa', and was knighted in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] in 2001 in recognition of services to scholarship in Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2001/birthday_honours_2001/1391003.stm |title=Birthday honours 2001: Honours in Scotland |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2001|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he was a recipient of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Royal Society of Edinburgh's]] Royal Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/royal-medal-awards-1-551717|title=Royal Medal awards |work=The Scotsman |date=3 September 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the recipient of honorary degrees from [[Queen’s University]] (Canada), [[Uppsala University]] (Sweden), [[University of Macerata]] (Italy) and [[Saarland University]] (Germany), as well as from Glasgow University, [[Queen Margaret University]] and the University of Edinburgh.

==Illness and death==
Just after retiring from his chair at the University of Edinburgh in 2008, MacCormick was diagnosed with inoperable cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pendreigh |first=Brian |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/premiere-brings-stone-of-destiny-home-to-dying-son-of-king-john-1-1438189 |title=Premiere brings Stone of Destiny home to dying son of 'King John' |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Organized religion''' (or '''organised religion'''—see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|spelling differences]]), also known as '''institutional religion''', is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]]. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].  

==Definition==
Organized religion, or institutional religion, is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Molnar, Darin R., PhD|title= Three Worldviews|date= 9 December 2010|url= http://www.middlewaymanagement.com/three-worldviews/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].

Organized religion is distinguished from the broader idea of [[religion]] especially in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]]. American philosopher [[William James]] states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion... shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude... in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, William|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 31|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; James further comments that the essential elements of "institutional religion" are "[[worship]] and [[sacrifice]], procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity [i.e.] [[theology]], and [[ceremony]] and [[Clergy|ecclesiastical organization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, Williams|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 30|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized religion seems to have gained prevalence since the [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]] with the rise of wide-scale [[civilization]] and [[History of agriculture|agriculture]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} Organized religions may include a [[state religion|state's official religion]], or [[state church]]. However, most political states have any number of organized religions practiced within their jurisdiction. Due to their structured, standardized, and easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's [[major religious groups]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} The [[Abrahamic religion]]s are all largely considered organized (including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]), as well as some schools of thought within [[Indian religion]]s (for example, some schools of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Religions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many [[indigenous religion|indigenous]] and [[folk religion]]s, such as [[traditional African religion]]s, [[Native American religion]]s and [[prehistoric religion]]s, as well as personal religions including some strands of [[Hinduism]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Modern views==
In the modern era, the definition of the term 'religion' is becoming increasingly opaque, making the task of defining 'organised religion' difficult. Anthropologists, theologians and scholars have thus attempt to embed the idea of an 'organisation' into the definition of religion itself. Some examples of this are found in the definition provided by Clifford Geertz, who defines religion as a "Cultural system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=V86CXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=geertz+religion+as+a+cultural+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn7Y_ukYXdAhUVdt4KHb6_AHQQ6AEIKTAA|title=Religion as a Cultural System|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|date=1966|publisher=Tavistock|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Max Weber's prominent definition of a religion includes the idea of a 'Church,' not necessarily in the Christian formulation, but insisting on the notion of an organised hierarchy constituting a palpable religious body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=abS61el-VEMC&amp;dq=Weber+definition+of+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQvKSJkoXdAhUXfd4KHecABDsQ6AEILDAA|title=The Sociology of Religion|last=Weber|first=Max|date=1993|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807042052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it becomes apparent that 'organised religion' has also been considered as part of the definition of religion itself, which in the modern era has caused a degree of controversy with the prominence of aforementioned personalized faith systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Paul Wernle''' (1 May 1872 &amp;ndash; 11 April 1939) was a Swiss [[theologian]], born in [[Hottingen (Zürich)|Hottingen]], today part of the city of [[Zürich]].

He studied at the Universities of [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. At [[Basel]] he was a student of [[Bernhard Duhm]] (1847-1928), and in [[Göttingen]] was influenced by [[Wilhelm Bousset]] (1865-1920). In 1900 he became an associate professor at Basel, where in 1905 he was appointed a full professor of [[New Testament Studies]]. During the course of his career he also taught classes in [[Dogmatic theology|dogmatics]] and [[church history]].

Wernle was a representative of the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' ([[history of religions school]]). His expertise was in the field of [[New Testament]] analysis, and he is largely remembered for his work involving [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptic]] and [[Saint Paul|Pauline]] research.

He died in Basel.

''' Peter W. Heller''' (born 5 September 1957) ) is a former Deputy Mayor of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Germany, environmental scientist, and venture philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Peter W. Heller was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the son of Wolfgang Heller, entrepreneur in the printing industry, and Ingeborg Heller. He studied economics and philosophy at the [[university of St. Gallen]], [[university of Lausanne]] (Switzerland) and [[university of Freiburg]] (Germany) where he obtained his PhD (Dr. rer.pol.) in 1988 with a thesis on "The Problem of Environmental Degradation in Economic Theory".  In 1988, he married Micaela Heller. They have two children, Julia (born 1989) and Jakob (born 1991).

== Professional career ==
1984 Heller was elected to the City Council of Freiburg and served on the Council’s committees for the municipal budget, environment, and culture. He left the Council in 1990 after his election as Deputy Mayor.

1990 the Council of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] elected him as Deputy Mayor to head the local administration's environmental protection department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1995/34/Alles_Oeko_oder_was_ DIE ZEIT, 34 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; the first of its kind in Southern Germany (until 1996). It comprised the offices of municipal environmental law  and regulations, waste management, urban park and forestry services, local energy  management and climate policy.

1993 the Executive Committee of [[ICLEI]] – Local Governments for Sustainability elected him as Chairman (until 1997). ICLEI is a major global network and agency of local governments committed to environmental protection and local sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner Zeitung: [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/staedte-wollen-regierungen-unter-druck-setzen-linz-baut-eine--solar-city--fuer-25-000-menschen,10810590,8930110.html], abgerufen am 12. März 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 Heller founded the investment company forseo GmbH which holds equity stakes in companies of the solar PV, windpower, and energy efficiency industry. He serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Boards of Streb AG (since 2012) and of Fahrenheit GmbH (since 2018). He co-founded solar PV and windpower development companies in Chile, Brazil and France, and provided seed capital for technology developers in the US and Germany.

Heller is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the [[Canopus Foundation]], a private non-profit organisation which became one of the pioneers of Venture Philanthropy in Germany. Since 2000 the foundation has been providing grants and business development assistance to social enterprises active in the field of rural energy access for low income communities in developing countries. In 2008 the Canopus Foundation and Ashoka International, Arlington Va. (US) jointly founded the Solar for All initiative,.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A.: „Der Frühphasenstifter“. In: wir - Das Magazin für Unternehmerfamilien, 2 (2012), S. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mersch, T. &amp; Merx, S.: „Die Business-Wohltäter“. In: enorm - Wirtschaft für den Menschen, 3 (2010), S. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the foundation has been promoting initiatives of new economic thinking towards more plurality in economic science, and encourages deliberation on the preconditions of a sustainable economy and society.

2001 he co-founded the „Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy (BASE)“, a „Collaborating Center“ of [[UNEP]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenkranz, E.: Netzwerk für erneuerbare Energien, in: Basler Zeitung (2002), Nr. 163, Teil II&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 Heller serves on the Board of Trustees of the European Environment Foundation, Basel, which holds an annual international convention of Environmental Laureates. In 2018 the Supervisory Board of HUMBOLDT-VIADRINA Governance Platform (HVGP) gGmbH elected him as Chairman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">In [[sociology]] and especially the [[sociology of religion|sociological study of religion]], '''plausibility structures''' are the sociocultural contexts for systems of meaning within which these meanings make sense, or are made plausible. Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.

==Origins==

The term was coined by [[Peter L. Berger]], who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[G. H. Mead]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967) p. 45 and p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social "world" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.

==Decline of religious plausibility==

Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.change.freeuk.com/learning/socthink/berger.html Peter Berger's ''the Homeless Mind'' thesis]&lt;/ref&gt; Berger considered that history "constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was "an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1971) p. 121 and p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wuthnow, ''Rediscovering the Sacred'' (1992) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected [[reference group]]s in maintaining one's plausibility structures,&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology (2007) p. 319-20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Phillips/D. L. Okholm, ''Christian Apologetics in the Postmodern World'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E. Crow |date=May 2018 |website=www.pacermonitor.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-self-portrait-1966 |title=Self-Portrai |author=Andy Warhol |date=1966 |website=MoMALearning |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

'''Psychology’s Feminist Voices''' (PFV) is an [[online]], [[multimedia]] [[digital archive]] containing the stories of women of psychology’s past and contemporary feminist psychologists who have shaped and continue to transform the discipline of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacArthur|first1=H.J.|last2=Shields|first2=S.A.|title=Psychology’s Feminist Voices: A critical pedagogical tool|journal=Sex Roles|date=2014|volume=70|pages=431–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses a wide range of materials, including  original biographical profiles, [[oral history]] interview [[transcript (law)|transcript]]s, video content, [[timelines]], [[bibliographies]], teaching resources, and an original 40-minute documentary on the emergence and current status of [[feminist psychology]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=liebert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebert|first1=R.|title=The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology|journal=Signs: Films for the Feminist Classroom|date=Fall 2009|issue=1.2|url=http://www.signs.rutgers.edu/rev_rl_film_1-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is continually expanding and currently has a database containing the profiles of over 250  psychologists from around the world.

PFV is also an online teaching resource, with sample [[syllabi]] for teaching [[history of psychology]] from a [[feminist]] perspective,  teaching guides for incorporating PFV material into history and psychology of gender courses, assignments, handouts, and teaching videos.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=L.C.|last2=Bazar|first2=J.|last3=Mackay|first3=J.|last4=Rodkey|first4=E.|last5=Rutherford|first5=A.|last6=Young|first6=J.L.|title=Using Psychology’s Feminist Voices in the classroom, Psychology of Women Quarterly|journal=Psychology of  Women Quarterly|date=2013|volume=37|pages=261–266|doi=10.1177/0361684313480484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leong|first1=Frederick T.L.

== History ==

The Psychology’s Feminist Voices project was founded by Alexandra Rutherford in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandra Rutherford|url=http://health.info.yorku.ca/health-profiles/index.php?mid=78979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It  began as a collection of [[oral histories]] with contemporary feminist psychologists, many of whom  established the field of [[feminist psychology]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the early 1970s. It quickly expanded, however, to encompass a larger goal: the documentation of women throughout psychology’s history, as well as a large and diverse sample of feminist psychologists in order to create a comprehensive picture of the impact of [[gender]], women’s participation, and [[feminism]], on the development of [[psychology]] as a science and profession.&lt;ref name=macarthur&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacArthur|first1=H.J.|last2=Shields|first2=S.A&gt;|title=Psychology’s Feminist Voices: A critical pedagogical tool|journal=Sex Roles|date=2013|volume=70|issue=431-433|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0349-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radtke|first1=H.L.|title=Canadian perspectives on feminism and psychology|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|location=New York, NY|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/905214823|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online resource, www.feministvoices.com, was launched in 2010 and now has a corresponding [[Facebook]] site, [[YouTube]] channel, and [[Twitter]] feed.&lt;br /&gt;
 
This project is based at [[York University]], [[Toronto]], Canada. It has received funding from the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]], and has been endorsed by the Society for the Psychology of Women, Division 35 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), the Society for the History of Psychology, Division 26 of the APA, the Section on Women and Psychology of the Canadian Psychological Association, and the [[Association for Women in Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/about|website=PFV: About Us|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The Psychology’s Feminist Voices [[digital archive]] has two main sections: 
Women Past (1848-1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Past|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/past|website=Women Past|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Feminist Presence(1950-).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Presence|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/presence|website=Feminist Presence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women Past section contains [[Demographic profile|profiles]] of women who received their [[doctoral degrees]] in psychology before 1950. The Feminist Presence section features profiles of and interviews with self-identified feminist psychologists who received their doctorates after 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voieces|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/|website=Feminist Voices|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sections contain the following subsections:

'''Profiles:''' Each psychologist  has a profile page containing their training, affiliations, biographies, media links, photographs, and a list of selected works. The Feminist Presence profiles also usually include transcripts and video clips of interviews conducted by the PFV team.&lt;br /&gt;
 
'''Timeline:'''  Provides a [[chronology]] of major events in feminist history and psychology, beginning with the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] up to recent breakthroughs such as the publication of the report on the trafficking of women and girls by The Society for the Psychology of Women Special Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the trafficking of women and girls|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-35/leadership/task-forces/trafficking/women-girls-report.aspx|website=Division 35|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resources:''' Includes bibliographies, teaching materials, websites, and archives with relevant collections. All of these resources are meant to serve as starting points for teaching and research on the history of women in psychology and science, as well as the history of feminism. An original teaching video series, "Feminist Psychologists Talk About..." is also featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Psychologists Talk About|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/psychology-s-feminist-voices-teaching-resources/ “Feminist Psychologists Talk About…”|website=Teaching Videos|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first video in the series is on women’s mental health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Mental Health Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czc2_uidOm8|website=Women's Mental Health video|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminist therapy]].

'''Search Page:''' The content of the site is searchable by keyword, name, birth and death dates, training location, and affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clink|first1=Kellian|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|journal=Reference Reviews|date=December 2014|volume=29|issue=3|pages=16–17|doi=10.1108/RR-12-2014-0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; This page also includes a rotating banner of “Featured Psychologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Page|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/search|website=Search Page|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional Content ===

'''Video Resources:''' The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Resource|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Ezm5XfaXA|website=The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an original [[documentary]] that uses archival material and interviews to explore the context in which feminist psychology emerged and how it has shaped the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=liebert /&gt; Original interview clips from individual psychologists can also be found on PFV’s YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original interview clips|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/psychsfeministvoices/|website=Feminist Voices YouTube Channel|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1931 Act ed.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Architects Act 1997]] imposes restrictions on the use of the name, style or title "architect" in connection with a business or a professional practice, and for that purpose requires a statutory [[Register of Architects]] to be maintained. The [[Architects Registration Board]] constituted under the Act is responsible for '''Architects Registration in the United Kingdom''' and is required to publish the current version of the Register annually. Every person who is entitled to be registered under the Act has the right to be entered in the Register. The Act consolidated previous enactments originating with the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 as amended by the Architects Registration Act 1938]]. It applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Section 2 of the Act prescribes that the Board shall appoint and regulate the functions ascribed to the '''Registrar'''. The Act refers to the Registrar by the masculine [[pronoun]] in the singular, but by the usual rules of [[statutory interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; this is not limited to an individual male person.

An [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment]] under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] came into force on 20 June 2008.

The recurring controversy about whether statutory protection of title serves useful purposes has been intensified by the legislative impact of the [[EU Directive]] on [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Unfair Commercial Practices]] implemented in May 2008 by two [[Statutory Instrument]]s under the European Communities Act 1972, namely No 1276 ([[Trade Descriptions Act 1968|Trade Descriptions]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081276_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1276]&lt;/ref&gt; and No 1277 ([[Consumer Protection]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081277_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1277]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006], "regulatory function" is defined in subsection 32(2).

==Use of the title "architect"==

Under subsection 20(1) of the [[Architects Act 1997]], a person in the [[United Kingdom]] may only practise or carry on business under any name, style or title containing the word "[[architect]]" if registered. There is no restriction on its use in any other circumstance. The words in the current Act follow those of the 1938 Architects Registration Act under which it was decided that the use of the suffix "FRIBA" in business notepaper constituted an infringement.

By subsection 20(3) corporate bodies, firms or partnerships can carry on business under a name, style or title containing the word "architect" provided that (in broad terms) the architectural business is run by a registered person. However the statutory registration Board may (by rules made under subsection 20(4) – see General Rules, Rule 25) effectively limit the application of subsection 20(3) to those corporate bodies firms or partnerships who have supplied information necessary for determining whether the architectural business is run by a registered person.

The rule-making power under subsection 20(4) appears to be limited to prescribing particular information to be provided to the Board viz. "such information necessary for statutory registration determining whether [subsection 20(3)] applies". The subsection makes no provision for levying any fee.

==Background to legislation==

===Up to the 1990s===

Opinions had been divided for well over a century about the merits of statutory registration of architects in the United Kingdom. The result was that Parliament, as the legislator and guided by the government of the day, has had to maintain a state of benevolent neutrality among the holders of these contending views, consistent with more general public policies for business competition, employment, professional education and so on. In relation to statutory protection of title, three aspects of the field in which architects practise invite examination. In summary:

* ''The design quality of the built environment'': this is essentially a cultural concern which was and remains one of the principal reasons for the formation and continuance of the Royal Institute of British Architects as a chartered body. It has connotations not only for the United Kingdom but world wide. It is beyond the ambit of statutory protection of title.
* ''The technical sufficiency of buildings'': the public interest is secured in the United Kingdom under Building Regulations and other enactments. This too is beyond the statutory protection of the title "architect".
* ''The business of architectural practice'': contracts of engagement for professional services are always between a business entity (whether individual, firm, partnership, or company) and the client, and are governed by the general law, including consumer protection legislation where applicable. Protection of the title ‘architect’ for business entities is of no practical relevance for securing the performance of architectural services.

In the light of experience since the inception of the Register under the 1931 Act, and more particularly under the Architects Registration Board’s regime from 1997, the recurring question has been whether protection of title serves useful purposes in respect of the three aspects mentioned above. The question of obsolescence has been further intensified by the [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], effective from 2007.

Statutory registration had its origin within the architectural profession in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was then (as now) a matter of controversy. However, by 1905 the [[RIBA]] had established a policy to secure satisfactory training of architects by statutory means.

The basis of the policy (on registration) had always been that the profession was governed by voluntary associations of practising architects and that the profession would retain control of registration. This was reflected in the composition of the registration body (the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] - [[ARCUK]]) established by the 1931 Act. Shortly after, in the book published on occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''The Growth and Work of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' edited by J. A. Gotch PPRIBA [[John Alfred Gotch]]

.&lt;/ref&gt; in the concluding paragraphs of the chapter on statutory registration.,&lt;ref&gt;In this chapter the author includes an informative account of the history of registration quoting extensively an article published in the ''RIBA Journal'' of 8 August 1931 by Charles MacArthur Butler, Secretary of the RIBA Registration Committee and first Registrar to ARCUK.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Barnes FRIBA., Chairman of the Registration Committee, wrote -

:''" ... I do not conceive the purpose of the Registration Act to be that of protecting the Architectural profession. The interests of the Profession are of course legitimate but are best served by the Architectural Associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture are to be found.''

:''"The object of the Registration Act is to ensure to the public that the architects they employ possess capacity and character.''

:''"Under the purview of the [[Board of Architectural Education]] no one will enjoy the title of '[[Registered Architect]]' without giving evidence of his capacity, and under that of the Discipline Committee no one will retain the title whose character has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.''

:''"The [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] can never, therefore, on this view be a rival of any Architectural Association and least of all of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].''

:''"The Architects' Registration Council stands at the gateway of the realm of Architectural practice, but within that realm the affairs of the Architect are best administered by those voluntary Associations to which he has allied himself and over the actions of which he has complete control."''

After more than half a century times have changed and a regime of quite another kind has been installed under the 1997 Act.

===From the 1990s===

By the 1990s it was almost universally accepted that the time had come to bring the statutory Architects' Registration Council as it then was to an end. Opinion within the profession was divided among those who held that statutory registration should be discontinued altogether and those who held that the registration body should be reconstituted.

In the event the body was reconstituted as the Architects Registration Board (1996/1997 Acts). But it was only after the event that many in the profession came to appreciate the effect of the new requirement that the majority of the Board should be non-architects and appointed by the government, as the following quotation shows:

:"''Crucially, professional control of the Register was taken away by the government's decision which was realised in the 1996/97 Act. This had not been generally expected by those of the membership who before then had been in favour of continuing protection of the title '[[architect]]'. The significance and effect of the change is now becoming more widely understood.''" (Report of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Council's Task Group on the [[Architects Registration Board]], September 2004.)

===Statutory Registration – chronology of key events===

'''''1834''''' - The body which was to become the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (originally known as the Institute of British Architects in London) was formed by [[Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey]] and several prominent architects. (After the grant of the charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.)&lt;ref&gt;about the RIBA Charter and Byelaws {{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426122320/http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} |Text of the Charter and Byelaws

'''''1837''''' - It was granted its [[Royal Charter]] under [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

'''''1884''''' - [[Society of Architects]] formed, after a campaign by a group of ARIBA to be allowed to vote on RIBA affairs had been resisted by FRIBA.

'''''1887''''' - Architects and Engineers Registration Act Committee formed as an independent committee to promote a bill for registration of architects, engineers and surveyors. The bill was withdrawn after chief bodies representing engineers petitioned against it.

'''''1889 &amp; 1891''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee put forward bills for registration of architects, which were strongly supported by the [[Society of Architects]] but opposed by an independent group of prominent architects and artists.

'''''1892''''' - Papers published, defining the profession of architecture:
:[[Norman Shaw]] and [[T. G. Jackson|T G Jackson]] (eds.) "Architecture, A Profession or an Art".
:[[William H. White (architect)|William H White]] "''The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art''".

'''''1902''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee amalgamated with the Society of Architects as a joint Registration Committee.

'''''1905''''' - RIBA Education Policy was adopted for statutory powers to secure satisfactory training for architects by way of registration of title, by and through the RIBA.

'''''1908''''' - RIBA Licentiate Class formed, for architects who could show evidence of competence, without exams. On closure in 1913, over 2000 had been accepted.

'''1924-1959''' - RIBA Standing Registration Committee.

'''''1925''''' - Amalgamation of [[RIBA]] and [[Society of Architects]]: most of the [[Society of Architects]] members transferred to Licentiate class, which was reopened.

'''''1927''''' - RIBA Registration Committee has draft bill introduced in Parliament, but opposed by the [[Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors]] and the [[Faculty of Architects and Surveyors]].

'''''1931''''' - Bill recast and enacted as the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, enabling the [[Register of Architects]] to be established under a statutory body called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK). The Council was to be made up of representatives of all architectural bodies in the [[United Kingdom]] in proportion to the numbers of their memberships on the Register, and representatives from government departments and related professional bodies. Under ARCUK, the RIBA system of exams etc. was accepted for registration. (The provisions of the Act constituting the [[Board of Architectural Education]] were repealed when ARCUK was reconstituted as ARB in 1996/7.)

'''''1937''''' - A letter is sent by "the president of the council" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognizing the fact that there was nothing in the Bill which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938) to interfere with the activities of registered architects. The letter is mentioned by
[[Lord Goddard]],Lord Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court in 1957 allowing the appeal of an architect (Hughes) against a professional miscondct decision of the Discipline Committee of ARCUK (later renamed [[Architects Registration Board]]), a case which becomes cited in later cases and in legal text-books as a judicial precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1938''''' - The Architects Registration Act, 1938 changed the protected title from "Registered Architect" to "Architect".

'''''1957''''' - Resulting from the 1938 legislation, an appeal by an architect against ARCUK is allowed by the High Court in a case which becomes a judicial precedent, ''Hughes v. Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom'': "It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful."—Devlin J. ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]])&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1992''''' - Government, in response to a request from ARCUK, commissioned review of the Architects Registration Acts by an independent assessor (John Warne).

'''''1993''''' - [[Warne Report]] published - principal recommendation: abolition of protection of title "architect" and disbanding of ARCUK. RIBA Council initially supported this recommendation, but this was resisted by the RIBA membership. As a result RIBA campaigned for the retention of protection of title with a "stream-lined" registration board.

'''''1996''''' - Part III of [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]], among other things, reconstituted the registration body as the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

'''''1997''''' - Architects Act 1997, a consolidating act, brought together the provisions of Part III of the 1996 Act and previous registration legislation. The Architects Registration Board then established with a majority of appointed lay members and a minority of elected Architect members.

'''''2008''''' - [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==The present legislation==

===Summary of legislative history===

The following analysis of the operative and other parts of the Architects Act 1997 as it was before the [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment of June 2008]] pays attention to details which sometimes go unnoticed.

The Act is fairly short. That is partly due to its conciseness, but this quality makes it all the more necessary to remember that the Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the meaning and effect of its various parts. Care is needed not to read into it what is not there (whatever conventional wisdom may have supposed or desired), and not to fail to notice what actually is there. In particular, like many such Acts, it can be better understood by looking at its beginning (Arrangement of Sections and long title) and its end (derivations), as well as the operative part in between.

Its long title is "An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects". The Table of Derivations printed at the end lists the enactments which it consolidated; and Schedule 3 lists the originating and two amending Acts which it repealed, namely: the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Architects Registration Act 1938 and parts of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.

The unbroken continuity of these enactments is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2:

:''"the Council" means the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''

The changes made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act as amended can be deduced from the Table of Derivations. This also shows that, for the purpose of the consolidation, certain definitions were inserted in the "Interpretation" section. These included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not vice versa). In subsection 14(1) the phrase is expanded as: "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

===The "burdens" and "choices"===

The scheme of the consolidation Act of 1997 is identical with that of the originating Act of 1931, as amended. It is as follows:

:It operates by imposing (under Part IV) one kind of burden, backed by threat of penal sanction, on persons carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]] generally, but at the same time giving to one particular group of persons a statutory right to choose instead to submit to another kind of burden, and to another group of persons the statutory right to choose to submit to a third kind of burden.&lt;ref&gt;For the statutory meaning of "burden" see: s.1(5)(b) of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940040_en_1.htm Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994]; s.2 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010006.htm Regulatory Reform Act 2001], and s.1 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the first is described as the "general burden"; the other two as the "voluntary burdens"; and the freedom to choose the "statutory choices".

The general burden is a prohibition imposed on all persons, firms, partnerships and bodies corporate carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]], including architects and [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architects]]. The prohibition is against practising or carrying on business under the title of "[[architect]]", with two exceptions, viz.:

:*In the case of an individual, s/he has opted for one of the voluntary burdens and is registered or enrolled under the Act.

:*In the case of a business entity (body corporate, firm or partnership) it has opted for the other of the voluntary burdens, in that its business so far as it relates to architecture satisfies the statutory requirement to be under the control, management and supervision of a registered person.

Here, the first of these is described as a "practice volunteer", and the second as a "business volunteer".

The statutory choice is exercisable:

:*In the case of a practice volunteer, by applying for registration in the [[Register of Architects]] and paying the annual retention fee (under sections 4 to 11), or by enrolling in the statutory list of visiting EEA architects (under section 12).

:*In the case of a business volunteer, by complying with the control, management and supervision requirements (of subsection 20(3)).

The voluntary burdens which result from the exercise of the statutory choice are as follows:

:*In the case of a registered person, to submit to the regime imposed on registered persons under sections 4 to 11 of Part II (payment of fees and satisfying requirements about qualifications and competence) and Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a person enrolled in the list of visiting EEA architects, to submit to the regime of section 12 and of Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a business volunteer, to submit to the regime for control, management and supervision imposed by subsection 20(3) and be liable to supply the Board with information showing compliance.

In consequence:

:*any person or business entity is free to supply services of the same kind as a registered person, but may only use the title "[[architect]]" in this connection subject to one of the voluntary burdens; and

:*a [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architect]] may only use this title in the course of professional practice if s/he has opted to submit to one of the voluntary burdens, normally as a registered person.

===Side effects===

A side effect of the Act is the imposition of burdens on third parties under Part II, namely, [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]], but the effect of the changes made by the 1996 Act is that Schools of Architecture have disappeared from the legislation without trace. The result has been a certain amount of wrangling between the Schools, the ARB and the RIBA which is the principal professional body, whose concerns inevitably include architectural education.

Another side effect has been a claim by the ARB to be able to impose on registered persons certain requirements about Professional Indemnity Insurance.

===The Board and its duties===

The membership of the Board is the result of one of the changes made by the 1996 Act to the registration body's previous constitution when its name had been the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The Act abolished the [[Board of Architectural Education]], renamed the Council as the Board, and made this Board consist predominantly of persons appointed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

Subsection 3(4) states "The Board shall publish the current version of the Register annually...". Provisions of Part II of the Act prescribe how the Register shall be kept up to date, and who shall be entitled to be registered; other provisions of Parts II and III prescribe for the Board the circumstances, events or conditions when a person's name shall be removed from the Register; and other provisions prescribe for the Board certain ancillary, or derivative and secondary, duties in connection with the Board's primary responsibility for the maintenance and regular publication of the [[Register of Architects]].

Apart from officers, employees and agents of the Board, the Act creates no duties or obligations towards the Board which fall on any one else at all; and nothing in the Act itself creates any obligation which an architect owes to the Board.

===Not delegated===

Section 20 of the Architects Act 1997 mentions "architecture" (subsection (3)(b)) and the "services" of a person enrolled under the Act (subsection (5)). These are not defined by the Act, and it is quite obvious that [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] has not delegated to the Board the power to define them. In practice, as technology and the building process continue to evolve new specialisms, the concept of architecture can be seen as becoming ever more fluid, extensive and comprehensive, and at the same time becoming narrower while ever more ancillary specialities are identified.

==The Board's Professional Conduct Committee==

Sanctions are available to the Board under Part III of the Act against any person on the register who is found guilty under section 15 of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence, or else has been convicted with a criminal offence which has relevance to fitness to practise.

Although a criminal conviction is an objective criterion, no statutory definition is given that defines the level of professional conduct or incompetence that will attract a sanction, judgment in the matter being given to the Board's Professional Conduct Committee, subject to commonsense, reason and judicial review.

The PCC is constituted under the Act, Schedule 1 Part II, as amended. The Committee includes members of the Board, both elected and appointed, as well as persons appointed by the Board and nominees of the President of the Law Society. A bare quorum of the Committee meets for a disciplinary hearing, comprising a nominee of the President of the Law Society (invariably a [[solicitor]]), a person from the Register and another not on the Register. PCC members are paid for their service.

==Categorisation==
The [[Architects Registration Board]] is admittedly not a professional body or society in the sense explained in Wikipedia article "[[British Professional Bodies]]". The question whether or not it is a "[[regulatory agency]]" was publicly considered in 2003. The June 2003 issue of the ''[[RIBA Journal]]'' included the following:

:''"The words 'regulator' and 'regulation' are not used in the Act and that status is not conferred upon the Board. It could be argued that the Board's assumption of this role is adverse to the public interest... A contrary proposition to the Board's claim is that an essential characteristic of a regulatory body in this context is to have jurisdiction or control over particular functions or activities in the supply of goods or services... whether or not the regulatory method is in conjunction with a system of certificating or licensing (such as applies to solicitors or places of entertainment)... The Board's claim to regulatory status appears to be the result of want of understanding how it can usefully go about fulfilling the services that have been assigned to it by statute for the public benefit..."''&lt;ref&gt;''RIBA Journal'', June 2003, referred to on page 1 of ''The Status of the Architects Registration Board.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003 the [[Architects Registration Board]] published a summary of a barrister's opinion which included the following:

:''"The Board as 'Regulator'. It has been suggested that the Board is not a 'regulator' of the architects’ profession... The precise generic description that any individual chooses to give to the collection of statutory duties imposed upon, and the powers available to, the Board under the 1997 Act is in any event irrelevant for the purposes of the questions asked,"'' [by the Board when obtaining this information for its own use] ''"for they largely involve issues of statutory interpretation which require the legislation to be construed and not given epithets."''&lt;ref&gt;For curbs on regulatory functions, see the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative &amp; Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and its Explanatory Note].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of "Chartered Practice"==

The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], which is a professional body (see Wikipedia category list [[British Professional Bodies]]), operates a voluntary "Chartered Practice" scheme. The use of the title "Chartered Practice" is authorised under Article 4.7 of the RIBA Charter (see reference below). The Institute's website explains that the scheme requires all architectural work of a Chartered Practice to be under the supervision of a Chartered Architect. A directory listing Chartered Practices has been published annually by the Institute from 2007.

==Qualification for registration==

The standard of qualification is not equal for all persons applying to be included in the [[Register of Architects]].

The Registrar is bound, under section 4 of the Architects Act, to register any person who applies for registration if that person has "such qualifications and has gained such practical experience as may be prescribed".

An alternative route to registration is to satisfy the Board that an equivalent standard of competence has been achieved. A matrix can be applied as follows:

{| border="1"
! Qualifications !! Practical experience !! RIBA Part III
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in UK
| ''Required''
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in UK
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|}

The disparity arises from the [[European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Qualifications in Architecture 85/384/EC. (Go to Article 4 of the main text for the required duration of training. The original Directive has been updated.) It is clearly stated in that Directive that "the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time".

As this is a minimum requirement there is nothing to stop a country applying higher standards to those obtaining qualifications and experience within its own jurisdiction. However it is widely held (and expressed in the report of Michael Highton to the RIBA Council) that any challenge to this disparity is likely to succeed on the grounds of irrationality. The report stated:

:''"In our view it is only a matter of time before a UK student, who has been denied registration on the grounds that he or she has not passed the Part 3 examination, yet who has been educated in the UK and achieved two years practical experience in the UK, successfully challenges such a decision on the basis that it is irrational to require a UK based student to possess a higher level of qualification and experience than is required of a non-UK based student or architect."''

If the Architects Registration Board reduced the registration requirement to four years full-time study, there is no reason why the RIBA should lower its entry standard.

==Break in annually produced copies of the Register==
At a time when there had occurred a hiatus in production under the legislation of printed copies of the Register in the annual series from 1933, the [[Architects Registration Board]] made a new departure and in 2012 announced an online version of the Register which registered persons were invited to use for demonstrating their professionalism to members of the public and to non-registered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architects-register.org.uk/ The Register of Architects] and as explained in ARB ebulletin of May 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www2.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120604184515/http%3A//www.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">{{short description|Using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs}}
'''Resource recovery''' is using [[waste]]s as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for [[landfill]] space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use [[raw material]]s in the manufacturing process. Materials found in [[municipal solid waste]] can be used to make new products. [[Plastic]], [[paper]], [[aluminium]], [[glass]] and [[metal]] are examples of where value can be found in waste.

Resource recovery goes further than just the [[Waste management|management of waste]]. [[life cycle analysis|Life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration, [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] and collection, [[reuse]] and [[recycling]] are important. For example, organic materials can be treated with [[anaerobic digestion]] and turned into energy, [[compost]] or [[fertilizer]].

Resource recovery can also be an aim in the context of [[sanitation]]. Here, the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in [[wastewater]] and [[human excreta]] (urine and feces). The term "toilet resources" has come into use recently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toiletboard.org/sanitation-economy|title="The Sanitation Economy"|last=|first=|date=26 March 2018|website=Toilet Board Coalition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those resources include: nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]), organic matter, energy and water. This concept is also referred to as [[ecological sanitation]]. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces (as in [[urine diversion]] toilets) and keeping [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separate in municipal wastewater systems.

== Materials used as a source ==

===Solid waste===
{{main|Recycling}}
[[Image:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|right|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, or sorted directly from mixed waste streams.

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[cartons]], [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.

===Wastewater and excreta===
{{main|Reuse of excreta|Wastewater reuse|Ecological sanitation}}
Valuable resources can be recovered from [[wastewater]], [[sewage sludge]], [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] and [[Human waste|human excreta]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include water, energy, and fertilizing nutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], as well as micro-nutrients such as [[sulphur]] and [[organic matter]]. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater, such as [[bioplastic]]s and metals such as silver.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Association of Regional Water Authorities. 2013. [https://www.uvw.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/362awk-VisionBrochure-AWK_def.pdf Vision brochure: Wastewater management roadmap towards 2030].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste, often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the 1970s, there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment, and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since around the year 2003, the concepts of [[ecological sanitation]] and [[sustainable sanitation]] have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As of 2016, the term "toilet resources" came into use, and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following resources can be recovered: 
*Water: In many water-scarce areas there are increasing pressures to recover water from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006, the [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP), developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many national governments have their own regulations regarding the use of recovered water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Singapore for example aims to recover enough water from its wastewater systems to meet the water needs of half the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/singapores-toilet-to-tap-concept/a-16904636|title=Singapore's 'toilet to tap' concept|last=|first=|date=2013-06-25|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They call this [[NEWater]]. Another related concept for wastewater reuse is [[sewer mining]].
*Energy: The production of [[biogas]] from [[Sewage sludge|wastewater sludge]] is now common practice at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]]. In addition, a number for methods have been researched regarding use of wastewater sludge and excreta as fuel sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/EWM/Treatment_Objectives/Production_Pellets_and_Electricity_from_FS.pdf|title=Production of Pellets and Electricity from Faecal Sludge|last=|first=|date=2015|work=SANDEC NEWS|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fertilizing nutrients: Human excreta contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients that are needed for agricultural production. These can be recovered through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] or stripping processes, or simply by use of the wastewater or [[sewage sludge]]. However, reuse of sewage sludge poses risks due to high concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as [[heavy metals]], [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s and other chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the majority of fertilizing nutrients are found in excreta, it can be useful to separate the excreta fractions of wastewater (e.g. toilet waste) from the rest of the wastewater flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Source Separation and Decentralization for Wastewater Management|last=Larsen|first=Tove A.|last2=Udert|first2=Kai M.|last3=Lienert|first3=Judit|date=2013-02-01|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393481|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the risk for undesirable compounds and reduces the volume that needs to be treated before applying recovered nutrients in agricultural production.

Other methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing [[Hermetia illucens|Black Soldier Flies]] in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalander|first=Cecilia|last2=Diener|first2=Stefan|last3=Magri|first3=Maria Elisa|last4=Zurbrügg|first4=Christian|last5=Lindström|first5=Anders|last6=Vinnerås|first6=Björn|title=Faecal sludge management with the larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) — From a hygiene aspect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969713004555|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=458-460|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are harvesting [[fatty acid]]s from wastewater to make bioplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wateronline.com/doc/revolutionary-tech-makes-plastic-from-wastewater-0001|title='Revolutionary' Tech Makes Plastic From Wastewater|last=|first=|date=2015-04-07|work=Water Online|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic matter===
{{main|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[Image:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|right|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Disposed materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as [[methane]]) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/[[cogeneration]]) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter.

There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) has been found to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Municipal Solid Waste Management in the State of Kuwait]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle analysis]] (LCA) was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale, enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

==Recovery methods==
In many countries, source-separated [[curbside collection]] is one method of resource recovery.

=== Australia ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In Australia, every urban domestic household is provided with three bins: one for [[recycling]]; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin is provided by the municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have [[dual-stream recycling]], with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a [[materials recovery facility]] for further processing.

Municipal, commercial and industrial, construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated: recyclables sorted and made into new products, and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS), the recycling rate is high and is "increasing, with 99% of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year (2003 survey), up from 85% in 1992". In 2002–03 "30% of materials from municipalities, 45% from commercial and industrial generators and 57% from construction and demolition debris" was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well: some [[landfill gas]] is captured for fuel or electricity generation, although this is considered the last resort, as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether.

==Sustainability==
Resource recovery is a key component in a business' ability to maintaining [[ISO14001]] accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system (such as recycling: glass, food waste, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles etc.)

[[Education]] and [[awareness]] in the area of  resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of [[resource management]]. The [[Talloires Declaration]] is a declaration for [[sustainability]] concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental [[pollution]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]], and the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resources]]. Local, regional, and global [[air]] pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, [[soil]], and [[water]]; depletion of the [[ozone layer]] and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its [[biodiversity]], the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing [[environmental management]] and resource recovery programs. [[University]] and [[vocational]] education are promoted by various organizations, e.g., [[WAMITAB]] and [[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their [[reverse vending machines]] to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include [[Tomra]] and [[Envipco]].

In 2010, CNBC aired the documentary ''[[Trash Inc: The Secret Life of Garbage]]'' about waste, what happens to it when it's "thrown away", and its impact on the world.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secret-garbage-20100929,0,2134032.story Television review: 'Trash Inc.'], [[Susan Carpenter]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended producer responsibility===
[[Extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) is a  pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the "end-of-life disposal costs" encourages more accuracy in pricing. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products, from production, to packaging, to transport and disposal or reuse. EPR requires firms that manufacture, import and/or sell products to be responsible for those products throughout the life and disposal or reuse of products.

The '''Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science''' ('''RSMAS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|z|.|m|ə|s}}) is a academic and research institution for the study of [[oceanography]] and the [[atmospheric sciences]] within the [[University of Miami]] (UM). It is located on a 16 [[acre]] (65,000 m²) campus on [[Virginia Key]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is the only subtropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/ref/ref.php|title=The Reference Desk|accessdate=February 18, 2010|publisher=UnderwaterTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinesciencetoday.com/2009/07/17/university-roundup-rosentstiel-school-of-marine-and-atmospheric-science-at-the-university-of-miami/|publisher=Marine Science Today|title=University Roundup: Rosentstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2008, RSMAS was solely a [[graduate school]] within the University of Miami, while it jointly administrated an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate program]] with UM's College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the Rosenstiel School has taken over administrative responsibilities for the undergraduate program, granting Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) [[baccalaureate degree]]. [[master's degree|Master's]], including a Master of [[First professional degree|Professional]] Science degree, and  [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorates]] are also awarded to RSMAS students by the UM Graduate School.&lt;ref name=mps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mps.rsmas.miami.edu/|title=Master of Professional Science - Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science - University of Miami|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|title=Message from the Dean {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} University of Miami|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000147/http://www.miami.edu/gs/index.php/graduate_school/about_us/message_from_the_dean/|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosenstiel School's research includes the [[marine biology|study of marine life]], particularly ''[[Aplysia]]'' and [[coral]]; [[climate change]]; air-sea interactions; [[coastal ecology]]; and [[admiralty law]]. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland [[sinkhole]]. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite downlink facility.

==History==
[[Image:Rosenstiel Entrance Plate.jpg|thumb|left|The sign near the entrance to RSMAS.]]

In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe recruited [[F.G. Walton Smith]], a young British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|publisher=University of Miami|accessdate=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] near the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|title=The History of the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science|first=Jean|last=Yehle|work=www.rsmas.miami.edu|accessdate=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183106/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/about-rsmas/history/|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, a delegation from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] prompted the [[Florida State Legislature]] to support the development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|State Board of Conservation]], which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AGQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3195,6215129&amp;dq=florida+marine+laboratory&amp;hl=en|title=State Adds $25,000 in Tide Fight|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=January 27, 1954|page=5|quote=The Legislature appropriated $80,000 per year for research work and specified that it be paid from shell revenues.|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961,&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy H. and Lewis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|url=http://www6.miami.edu/umbulletin/und/marine/index.htm|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiannual Status Report NASA GRANT NGR-10-007-010|date=October 31, 1966|url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670082520_1967082520.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor [[Lewis Rosenstiel|Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel]] after a major contribution from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name=msc/&gt; The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]], and in 2008, the program relocated to [[SUNY at Stony Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafcseafood.org/Documents/conquest_of_the_ocean.pdf|title=Conquest of the Ocean|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stony Brook Southampton Broadens Scope With Ocean Conservation Institute|url=http://www.hamptons.com/detail.php?articleID=4646|first=Kelly |last=Carroll|work=hamptons.com|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Science &amp; Spirit''''' is a discontinued American bimonthly magazine that covered scientific stories with an eye toward their spiritual implications. 

==History and profile==
It was launched by the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1989 as a newsletter, converted to a glossy magazine in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=George|title=Science and Religion: Bridging the Great Divide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/30/science/essay-science-and-religion-bridging-the-great-divide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=18 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; then repositioned for a general readership in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Templeton Foundation Publications|url=http://capabilities.templeton.org/2004/press03.html|work=John Templeton Foundation|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding editor was Kevin Sharper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michelle Roth|title=Dr. Kevin Sharpe, Union Institute &amp; University Professor, was Founding Editor of Science and Spirit Magazine|url=http://myunion.edu/2008/11/dr-kevin-sharpe-union-institute-university-professor-was-founding-editor-of-science-and-spirit-magazine/|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=Union Institute|date=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was published by Science &amp; Spirit Resources, Inc. five times a year during the initial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science &amp; Spirit Magazine to Hit Bookstores Nationwide|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/science--spirit-magazine-to-hit-bookstores-nationwide-ingram-periodicals-to-distribute-magazine-on-science-and-religion-74160377.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=21 April 1999|location=Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it was purchased by [[Heldref Publications]], though the John Templeton Foundation continued to provide editorial support. The publication was renamed ''Search'' in 2008 before being discontinued in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Search|title=Search|date=September 2008|volume=19|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science and religion scholar [[Karl Giberson]] took over as editor-in-chief of the magazine in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giberson new Editor-in-Chief of Science &amp; Spirit Magazine|url=http://www.metanexus.net/Magazine/Default.aspx?TabId=68&amp;id=8389&amp;SkinSrc=%5BG%5DSkins%2F_default%2FNo+Skin&amp;ContainerSrc=%5BG%5DContainers%2F_default%2FNo+Container|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to raise the publication's profile and increase its subscriber base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slajda|first=Rachel|title=Where Science, Religion Meet|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=4G89-XB70-TWJ8-K3BF&amp;csi=152787&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=18 October 2011|newspaper=South Shore Insider|date=25 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, ''Science &amp; Spirit'' was nominated for Utne Independent Press Awards in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utne Independent Press Awards Nominees -- 2003|url=http://www.utne.com/2003-11-01/Utne-Independent-Press-Awards-Nominees-2003.aspx?page=4|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utne Independent Press Awards Nominees -- 2006|url=http://www.utne.com/2006-11-01/utne-independent-press-awards-nominees-2006.aspx?page=5|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees for the 19th Annual Utne Independent Press Awards 2007|url=http://www.utne.com/uipa.aspx|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its contributors featured notable scholars such as [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horgan|first=John|title=War or Peace|journal=Science &amp; Spirit|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Larson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Edward|title=Evolutionary Dissent|journal=Science &amp; Spirit|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=48–52|doi=10.3200/sspt.16.2.48-52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Lightman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lightman|first=Alan|title=Wheels of Fortune|journal=Science &amp; Spirit|date=May–Jun 2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=28–33|doi=10.3200/sspt.17.3.28-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruse|first=Michael|title=America's Evolving Problem|journal=Science &amp; Spirit|date=Sep–Oct 2005|volume=16|issue=5|pages=38–41|doi=10.3200/sspt.16.5.38-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.

[[File:SomersetSpaceWalk-The Sun (open side).jpg|thumb|right|The walk begins here: the Sun model at Higher Maunsel Lock]]
The '''Somerset Space Walk''' is a [[sculpture trail]] model of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Somerset]], England. The model uses the [[towpath]] of the {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=off|sing=on}} [[Bridgwater and Taunton Canal]] to display a model of the [[Sun]] and its planets in their proportionally correct sizes and distances apart. Unusually for a [[Solar System model]], there are two sets of planets.

Aware of the inadequacies of printed pictures of the Solar System, the Space Walk was designed by [[inventor]] Pip Youngman as a way of challenging our perceptions of space and experiencing the vastness of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=SCC_2&gt;{{cite web| title = Services Directory – Canal Walks | publisher = [[Somerset County Council]] | date = | url = http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/services/directory/service?rid=/wpccontent/Sites/SCC/Web%20Pages/Services/Services/Environment/Canal%20walks | accessdate = 20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The model is built to a scale of 1:530,000,000,&lt;ref name=PlutoPic&gt;From the inscription on the Pluto model ([http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/2334/4420/1600/320221/BL_Space.jpg photo of Pluto sculpture at Taunton end])&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that one millimetre on the model equates to 530 kilometres. The Sun is sited at Higher Maunsel Lock, and one set of planets is installed in each direction along the canal towards [[Taunton]] and [[Bridgwater]]; the distance between the Sun and each model of [[Pluto]] being {{Convert|11|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=SCC_2 /&gt; For less hardy walkers, the inner planets are within {{Convert|67|m|ft}} of the Sun, and near to the Maunsel Canal Centre (and tea shop) at Lower Maunsel Lock, where a more detailed leaflet about the model is available.&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt;

The Space Walk was opened on 9&amp;nbsp;August 1997 by British [[astronomer]] [[Heather Couper]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngman |first=Pip |title=Somerset Space Walk leaflet |url=http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Taunton Solar Model Group |accessdate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165218/http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a project team from Somerset County Council refurbished some of the models.

==Background==
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Sun 2.jpg|thumb|right|Maunsel Lock, showing the model of the Sun at the centre of the two sets of planets]]
The Walk is a joint venture between the Taunton Solar Model Group &lt;!--no web presence, don't wikilink--&gt; and [[British Waterways]], with support from [[Somerset County Council]], [[Taunton Deane]] Borough Council and the [[Somerset Waterways Development Trust]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt; The Taunton Solar Model Group comprised Pip Youngman, Trevor Hill – a local physics teacher who had been awarded the title of "[[Institute of Physics]] (IOP) Physics Teacher of the Year"&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; – and David Applegate who, during his time as Mayor of Taunton, had expressed a wish to see some kind of science initiative in the area. Pip came up with the idea for the Space Walk, and Trevor assisted by calculating the respective positions and sizes of the planets.

Funding for the project came from the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), the initial advertising leaflet was paid for by the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC) and there was also a small grant from [[Sustrans]], who fund art installations along cyclepaths, to deal with maintenance requirements in the years before Somerset County Council took on that responsibility. In order to apply for the COPUS funding Youngman needed two 'sponsors', so he wrote to [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (a local boy himself, then living in Sri Lanka) and [[Patrick Moore]], who both wrote warm letters in support. Arthur C Clarke's brother Fred read out his letter at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="SCGazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Space Walk launched|newspaper=Somerset County Gazette|date=15 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RMC Group|ReadyMix Concrete]] supplied the concrete for the plinths, and [[Avimo]] (now part of [[Thales Group]]), a local defence contractor, supplied the steel for the models.&lt;!--Note for EdJogg: Refs for PPARC and COPUS are on the Space Walk leaflets!--&gt;

==Individual models==
[[File:Bathpool - Canal and Neptune.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Uranus]] in its setting beside the canal at Bathpool.]]
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Jupiter]]]]
The model of the [[Sun]] is a {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}-wide 14-ton concrete sphere,&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; with a vertical segment removed to give two vertical faces upon which explanatory plates are mounted. The solid sphere was cast by Pip Youngman and Trevor Hill in the grounds of what was the [[SWEB]] storage yard adjacent to the Obridge Viaduct in [[Taunton]]. Originally 'natural' in colour (matching the other models) it was painted yellow as part of the refurbishment, making it much more visible.

Each of the smallest planet models is contained within a round-topped concrete plinth about {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. The stainless steel model is held inside a circular hole through the side of the plinth; hence the model of the planet may be viewed by looking through the hole. The plinths were created by Youngman using fibreglass moulds which he had also made.

The models of the largest [[gas giant]]s, [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], are moulded as part of the top face of the concrete pillars. Originally concrete-coloured, they have been painted as part of the refurbishment.

Each pillar doubles-up as a [[milepost]]: the distance to [[Bridgwater]] and [[Taunton]] is cast in the concrete at ground level – below a depiction of the [[British Waterways]] 'bridge' logo – although the sculptures are sited according to the spacings needed for the model, and not at kilometre increments for the convenience of boaters.

On each pillar is a plaque containing a short inscription describing the planet. The Earth inscription reads:

{{cquote|"Earth orbits far enough from the heat of the Sun for water to be liquid, near enough not to freeze, for air to be a gas and earth a solid. With gravity strong enough to hold our atmosphere, gentle enough to allow delicate life forms. Rotating to give our day and night, tilted to give the four seasons. Enormous to us, tiny on the cosmic scale. Our home, unique, beautiful, fragile." – ''Pip Youngman'' &lt;ref&gt;Caption may be read on [[:File:Somerset Space Walk Earth.jpg|photograph of model]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Nearest star==
The installation does not include a model of the [[nearest star]] for comparison, as this would be impossible. On the same scale as the other models, the nearest star ([[Proxima Centauri]], which is about one-seventh the size of the Sun) would need to be a red ball {{convert|37.5|cm|in}} in diameter&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as one-seventh the size of the Sun: 2.63 ÷ 7 = 0.375]&lt;/ref&gt; sited {{convert|76,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as 270,000 x distance from Earth to Sun (270,000 x 1.496x10^8 km) ÷ 530,000,000 = 76,000km &lt;br /&gt;{{pad|2em}}(where 1:530,000,000 is the scale of the model)]&lt;/ref&gt; away (roughly twice the circumference of [[Earth]]).&lt;!--
[Assumption]: An information panel on the Sun model indicates the size and distance of the nearest star.
''[The pdf leaflet implies that this distance is stated somewhere, and this is the logical place for it!]'' - EdJogg--&gt;

==Pip Youngman==
The Space Walk's designer, Philip Robert Vassar Youngman&lt;!--insufficient web presence to wikilink yet--&gt; (born: 26 August 1924, Hunstanton, Norfolk – died: 23 May 2007, Taunton, Somerset), known as 'Pip', was a designer and inventor of mechanical apparatus. Around 1969, Youngman was approached by the [[Open University]] to adapt a mechanical calculator he had designed, originally prototyped in [[Lego]], into a product suitable for school use. The result was the "Ball Operated Binary Calculator And Tutor" (BOBCAT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BOBCAT | work =  | publisher = Allard's Computer Museum, Groningen | date =  | url = http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | accessdate = 2009-03-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090228065606/http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | archivedate = 28 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical model for teaching binary arithmetic and the inner workings of the computer, using ball bearings for binary data bits and plastic levers for the calculating logic.&lt;!--and manufactured by E J Arnold--&gt;

==Location==
The trail can be walked either from Taunton's [[Brewhouse Theatre]] to Maunsel Lock ([[Pluto]] to the Sun) or from Bridgwater's Morrison's Supermarket to Maunsel Lock (also Pluto to the Sun) or of course, vice versa.

The locations of the end and middle point (with [[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|postcodes]] and coordinates) are:

Compositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including [[Public Radio Exchange]], [[WDAV]], New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) and [[Northwest Public Radio]]. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death. The Classical Music Sentinel published a positive review of the album, comparing it to a three-movement symphony.

==Composition==
''Tragic Lovers'', released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008, contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'', [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''. The album contains three tracks, each one comprising a single composition and running more than fifteen minutes in length.&lt;ref name=Liner&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Tragic Lovers|others=[[Oregon Symphony]]|year=2008|type=booklet|publisher=[[Delos Productions|Delos]]|first1=Harry J.|last1=Pack|first2=Jim|last2=Svejda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine for the Wagner and Berlioz works and Adam Stern for the Tchaikovsky composition. The album was [[Audio engineer|engineered]] by John Eargle, with Andrés Villalta serving as associate engineer for the Wagner and Berlioz recordings. [[Digital audio editor|Editing]] was completed by Fine (Wagner, Berlioz) and Stern (Tchaikovsky).&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt; The album marked the orchestra's final recording with DePreist as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.&lt;ref name=Delos&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://browse.delosmusic.com/Tragic-Lovers-James-DePreist-p/de%203369.htm|title=Tragic Lovers|accessdate=March 28, 2013|publisher=Delos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasts==
All three compositions were featured on the [[Public Radio Exchange]] program "Compact Discoveries"; the Berlioz and Tchaikovsky recordings aired on an episode titled "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet", and the Wagner recording was part of the following episode, titled "More Famous Lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32486/transcripts/86770|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 151: Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet|accessdate=April 18, 2013|publisher=[[Public Radio Exchange]]|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 151: "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32686/transcripts/87170|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 152: More Famous Lovers|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=Public Radio Exchange|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 152: "More Famous Lovers".&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Joe Brant featured the album on his [[WDAV]] program "New Classics", which highlights newly released classical music recordings.&lt;ref name=WDAV/&gt; New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) aired two tracks from the album: the Tchaikovsky recording was broadcast in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=726746&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 21, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Berlioz track aired in November 2010 and again on February 11, 2013, following DePreist's death on February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624057&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 02, 2010|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624331&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 03, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=847754&amp;eventID=209404|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Feb 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlioz recording also aired on the [[Northwest Public Radio]] program "Classical Music with Robin Rilette" on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.publicbroadcasting.net/nwpr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=845309&amp;eventID=229836|title=NWPR Playlists: Classical Music with Robin Rilette: Robin Rilette: Feb 01, 2013|publisher=[[Northwest Public Radio]] ([[Washington State University]])|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony.&lt;ref name=Duperron&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicalmusicsentinel.com/collections/collection-lovers.html|title=Collection – Tragic Lovers – James DePreist (Conductor) – Oregon Symphony Orchestra – Delos DE3369|accessdate=March 28, 2013|first=Jean-Yves|last=Duperron|publisher=Classical Music Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition "works perfectly" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a "central movement" for its more "pleasant" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and "tumultuous" qualities.&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt; Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions "loud and clear", and specifically highlighted the "massive walls of sound" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances "with clean and powerful dynamics throughout" and concluded the review by quipping: "This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!"&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt;

==Track listing==
#"Prelude and 'Liebestod' from ''Tristan and Isolde''" ([[Richard Wagner]]) – 17:14

'''Variation''' is a characteristic of language: there is more than one way of saying the same thing. Speakers may vary pronunciation ([[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), word choice ([[lexicon]]), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called "[[grammar]]").&lt;ref name="Meecham2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=Meecham|first1=Marjory|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=0-312-24738-9|editor1-last=O'Grady|editor1-first=William|edition=Fourth|chapter=Language in social contexts|editor2-last=Archibald|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Aronoff|editor3-first=Mark|editor4-last=Rees-Miller|editor4-first=Janie}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation – speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-3559-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native tongue.

Variationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs.  Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preston|first=Dennis R.|date=1993-06-01|title=Variation linguistics and SLA|journal=Second Language Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=153–172|doi=10.1177/026765839300900205|issn=0267-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Language variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the ''social'' characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding ''linguistic'' context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures.

Studies of language variation and its correlation with [[Sociology|sociological]] categories, such as [[William Labov]]'s 1963 paper "The social motivation of a sound change," led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labov |first=William |title=The social motivation of a sound change |doi=10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799|journal=Word |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=273–309 |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chambers |first=J.K. |title=Sociolinguistic Theory: Linguistic Variation and its Social Significance |publisher=Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-631-22882-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.

== Sociolinguistic variables ==
Studies in the field of [[sociolinguistics]] typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to
* be high in frequency,
* have a certain immunity from conscious suppression,
* be an integral part of larger structures, and
* be easily quantified on a linear scale.&lt;ref name="Labov662"&gt;Labov, William (1966), ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City'', Diss. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phonetics|Phonetic]] variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, [[morphophonological]] variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the [[glottal stop]], the height or backness of a [[vowel]] or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a [[double negative]]). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in "I kep' walking" (Wolfram 1969;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt. 1969. ''A Sociolinguistic Description of Detroit Negro Speech''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov et al. 1968&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William, Cohen, Paul, Robins, Clarence, &amp; Lewis, John. 1968. ''A Study of the Non-standard English of Negro and Puerto Rican Speakers in New York City''. Co-operative Research Report 3288, Vol. 1. Philadelphia: U.S. Regional Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;); and the [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#G-dropping|ING variable]], the optional pronunciation of ''-ing'' at the end of a word as ''-in''', as in "I kept walkin'" (e.g. Fisher 1958;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00437956.1958.11659655|pages=47–56|title=Social Influences on the Choice of a Linguistic Variant|journal=''word''|volume=14|year=2015|last1=Fischer|first1=John L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labov 1966/1982;&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966 [1982]. ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill 1974&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter. 1974. ''The social differentiation of English in Norwich''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Analysis and methodology ==
Analyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant ''could have'' occurred. This is called the "Principle of Accountability" in [[Sali Tagliamonte|Tagliamonte]] (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results.&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012&gt;Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). ''Variationist Sociolinguistics: Change, observation, interpretation''. UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–21}} This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns ''that'', ''who'', and zero).&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012 /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

== Association with age ==
There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.

One example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth.  Just as street youth dress differently from the "norm", they also often have their own "language".  The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. [[Age-graded variation]] is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies.&lt;ref name="Chambers2"&gt;Chambers, J.K. (1995). ''Sociolinguistic Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt; to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'.&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt;

People tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. [[William Bright]] provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'.&lt;ref name="Bright19972"&gt;Bright, William (1997). "Social Factors in Language Change." In Coulmas, Florian (ed) ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania. circa 2005. ''Phonological atlas of North America'', [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1.html Map 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the [[apparent-time hypothesis]] where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.

== Association with geography ==
{{Main|Dialectology}}
A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. [[Dialectology]] studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

== Association with gender ==
{{Main|Language and gender}}
Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).

The initial identification of a ''women's register'' was by [[Robin Lakoff]] in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society ("female deficit approach").&lt;ref name="Lakoff2"&gt;Lakoff, R.  (1975).  ''Language and Women’s Place''.  New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference ("dominance theory").&lt;ref name="OBarr2"&gt;O’Barr, William and Bowman Atkins. (1980) "'Women’s Language' or 'powerless language'?" In McConnell-Ginet et al. (eds) ''Women and languages in Literature and Society.'' pp. 93-110. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior.

More recently, [[Deborah Tannen]] has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences ("cultural difference approach"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a ''[[report]]'' style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a ''[[rapport]]'' style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen912"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. (1991). ''You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.'' London: Virago.&lt;/ref&gt;

People tend to [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00329|pages=171–175|title=Where is the Gender in Gendered Language?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=2|year=2016|last1=Thomson|first1=Rob|last2=Murachver|first2=Tamar|last3=Green|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''African American English (AAE)'''''

Communities of African Americans and Whites have been popular{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fix|first1=Sonya|date=2014|title=AAE as a bounded ethnolinguistic resource for white women with African American ties|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=35|pages=55–74|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2013.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=how does it help inform?|date=December 2017}} Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} step in understanding the origins of AAE.&lt;ref name=":1222"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of African American Language|last=Lanehart|first=Sonja|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-979539-0|location=New York|pages=1–895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American English]] and [[Southern American English|Southern White American English]] both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776).&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including [[Robbins Burling]], [[Ralph Fasold]], [[Joey Dillard]], [[William Labov]], Williams Stewart, [[Geneva Smitherman]], and [[Walt Wolfram]] to name a few.&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. There have been many different perspectives{{Vague|date=December 2017}} to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shollenbarger|first=Amy|date=2017|title=How African American English-Speaking First Graders Segment and Rhyme Words and Nonwords With Final Consonant Clusters|doi=10.1044/2017_LSHSS-16-0062|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|volume=48|issue=4|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asian English'''''

Very little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Wolfram, W., &amp; Schilling-Estes, N. (2005). American English: Dialects and variation. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Fought, Carmen. (2006). Language and Ethnicity. Cambridge,. UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the “[[model minority]]”,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kim, P. S., &amp; Lewis, G.B. 1994. “Asian-Americans in the Public-Service: Success, Diversity, and Discrimination.” Public Administration Review 54 (3): 285–90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term “Asian Americans” cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which “the dominant ideology treats as a single entity".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization. Research on Asian Americans in particular have noted the variation of Asian American speech.

== Safety of women journalists ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related [[sexual violence]] aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats on women journalists ===
[[Women in journalism|Women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], rape and even murder. Women journalists are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017.

Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online harassment of women journalists data ===

== Media freedom ==
'''Media freedom''' is the freedom to participate in media, the rights of expression, and access to and production of media content. These are all issues that can be fully understood only by considering their [[gender equality]] dimensions as they often overlap, and they have been compounded by the growing complexity of the digital sphere. Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men. In many [[newsroom]]s around the world, there continues to be a culture that makes it difficult for women to progress. In such workplaces, [[harassment]] is common, and a lack of monitoring means that even with gender equality [[Policy|policies]] in place, they are often ineffective in challenging [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Under-representation of women ===
A related challenge has been the absence of women's voices as an issue in media freedom, including in [[internet governance]] policy-making more generally. This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Dynamic Coalition and APC. 2016. Internet Governance Forum 2015: Learnings from the Gender Report Cards. GenderIT. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/resources/internetgovernance-forum-2015-learnings-genderreport-cards&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]), senior [[leadership]] positions remain largely dominated by men. In 2017, ICANN's board of directors consisted of four women and 16 men. Minimizing the divide between the number of women and men in senior decision-making roles in relation to internet governance is an important step to ensuring that gender-based issues relating to [[Access to information|access]], [[privacy]] and security are prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja, Avri Doria, Bruno Zilli, Margarita Salas, and Women's Legal and Human Rights Bureau. 2012. Critically Absent: Women’s Rights in Internet Governance. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; resources/critically-absent-womeninternet-governance-policy-advocacytoolkit&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of prevailing inequality, [[civil society]] continues to be a force for progress. Other organizations are working to push for greater representation and key standard-setting bodies, such as the Gender and Internet Governance eXchange, initiated by the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], which aims to redress the gap in participation by women's and [[Sexual rights|sexual rights’ activists]] in internet governance policy processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja. 2017. ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India. Internet Democracy Project. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://genderingsurveillance&lt;/nowiki&gt;. internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;York, Jillian C. 2016. The State of Free Expression Online in Southeast Asia. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Available at &lt;https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia&gt;. Accessed 4 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017. LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible. The Guardian.

=== Online activity ===
Gendered aspects of [[media freedom]] intersect heavily with [[Safety of Journalists|journalists’ safety]]. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] face unique concerns, such as personal safety when dealing with confidential [[Journalism source protection|sources]], which can restrict their freedom of expression and add challenges that can hamper their ability to carry. Another dimension is the manifestation of physical violence as virtual violence through the increased incidence of [[Online hate speech|hate speech]] and abuse directed towards women and the LGBTQI community. Such abuse has had a chilling effect and disrupted the [[online participation]] of these communities. Countering the proliferation of such abuse has proved a serious challenge for policy-makers wanting to minimize the harm directed towards vulnerable groups. To mark [[International Women's Day]] in 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted the challenges for [[government]]s, corporate bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] to address such abuses while remaining attentive to [[international human rights law]]. He counseled against censorship and undue restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] as a means of curbing [[Cyberbullying|online abuse]], warning that such restrictions could ‘end up undermining the rights of the very women for whom governments and corporate actors may seek to provide redress’.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR. 2017. UN experts urge States and companies to address online genderbased abuse but warn against censorship&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media pluralism ==
Media pluralism is evaluated in terms of [[Access to information|access]], plurality of economic models and diversity of content. [[Gender equality]] in decision-making roles, the media workforce and representation in the media has not yet been reached in any of these areas according to [[UNESCO]]'s World Trends Report.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Background ===
In the mid-1970s, pioneering academics made the first systematic analysis of women's relationship to and visibility in the mass media and in their ground-breaking study, they used the term ‘[[symbolic annihilation]]’ (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe what they found.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Available at &lt;Tuchman, G., Daniels, A.K., and Benoit, J. (1978) Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media: Oxford: Oxford University Press.&gt;. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost 40 years later, most gender and media scholars would suggest that progress has stalled, and there is significant work left to be done, including in relation to [[mainstream media]]. Women still feature less frequently than men in news discourse; women journalists and media professionals are often locked out of the more prestigious beats, and their occupation of senior positions within media organizations is still minimal. According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring]] Report in 2015 women made up only one in four media decision-makers, one in three reporters and one in five experts interviewed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women's visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015. London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://cdn.agilitycms&lt;/nowiki&gt;. com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/ reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_ report_en.pdf&gt;. Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opportunities afforded to ‘ordinary’ citizens by the creation of [[Alternative media|alternative online news]] platforms has meant, however, that women's voices and perspectives are finding expression via these informal media channels.

=== International recognition ===
The existence of problems regarding gender and media pluralism has also been recognized by regional and [[international organization]]s and agencies over several decades. In 2010, UNESCO developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media-framework-of-indicators-to-gauge-gender-sensitivity-in-media-operations-and-content/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Council of the European Parliament adopted the recommendation made by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]], that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0074+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 60th session of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 2016, United Nations (UN) Women launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 agenda for sustainable development]], which aims to eradicate all forms of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[UN Women]] launched ‘Step it Up for Gender Equality’, which had the tagline of ‘Planet 50:50 by 2030’. At the launch of that initiative, 70 nations committed to the gender equality agenda, and two years later, that number had increased to 93. In 2016, a review by UN Women of actions taken by these pledging nations reported a large number of initiatives, although none of them explicitly mentioned the media. Yet despite these initiatives, women remain excluded or marginalized in the media on the one hand, or else stereotyped and [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivialized]] on the other. Longitudinal studies of women and news predict that this is unlikely to change soon. At the current pace of change, parity of visibility between women and men is unlikely to occur for another 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News?

The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe and from diverse sectors who have committed themselves to focusing on gender equality in three main ways: in their reporting routines, by disrupting [[stereotype]]s and biases; by increasing the number of women in their organizations, including in leadership and decision-making roles; and in developing gender-sensitive corporate practices. At its launch, 39 media houses had already signed up as founding members of the Compact and although each will devise their own internal agenda, being a member of the Compact requires a minimum set of actions to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/media-compact&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender equality in the media workforce ===
In many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. iwmf.org/our-research/global-report/&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of women media professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media [[workforce]].&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are encouraged not to go into ‘hard’ news beats and instead are channeled into areas of news that are allegedly of more ‘interest’ to women and are also commonly held as being less prestigious. A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Monitoring Project]] (Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories about politics and crime see the least number of women reporters across all regions with the exception of Asia and Latin America. Unlike men, even when women do work on ‘hard’ news stories, they often struggle to achieve visibility for their copy: just over a third (37 per cent) of stories in newspapers, television and radio [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] had a female by-line or were visibly or audibly reported by women, the same as in GMMP's 2005 study. More focused individual country analyses show exactly the same trends; for example, research from the United States shows that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of [[columnist]]s at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Closer analysis from the [[World Trends report]] shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent) and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the United States shows a picture that has little changed from the GMMP's latest findings or indeed, from findings of its own previous studies. At 20 of the nation's top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Women's Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.womensmediacenter.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.media-2017&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016. The WMC study found that these gender-based disparities existed across all news media as much in newspapers, online news, wire services as broadcast, but were especially stark in television news.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The digital world is as likely to perpetuate the same gender divisions that exist in the off-line world as the opposite. There is little evidence to suggest that [[digital media]] are employing or promoting more women than other parts of the [[media ecology]]. The [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]]’s latest findings suggest that women's visibility as both citizens and media professionals in [[Online newspaper|online news sites]] and Twitter feeds was 26 per cent, only two percentage points higher than for television, radio and print. The situation behind the scenes at large internet companies, which hold influence over which news content is presented most visibly and are responsible for moderation of discussion and comments, has been equally dire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Women and decision-making ===
The challenge for many women is much more than just breaking into the industry, but also being able to advance to the highest levels in their careers. The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top management (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly 2011. The largest recent study of women media professionals, this report, which was researched for the International Women's Media Foundation and supported by UNESCO, looked at 59 countries and 522 news outlets.&lt;/ref&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and Eastern Europe (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in Asia and the Pacific region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings. Men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]]. Public sector organizations were more likely to recruit and promote women into senior positions than private sector media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017.

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Southern Africa, a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whosenews-whose-views/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that sexual harassment remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

For Mary Kosut, women remain vastly underrepresented as media owners, a trend that has continued unabated as media concentration has increased through media consolidation and convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Kosut, Mary, ed. 2012. Encyclopedia of Gender in Media. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and representation ===
Many feminist media scholars have argued that what we see in front of the camera is determined to some extent by who is behind the camera and there is some reason to believe that more women in the newsroom would produce news that is more diverse. Several studies, including the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP), show that women journalists are more likely to source women in their stories than men, leading to more balanced reporting which is better able to reflect the views of more and diverse communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The 2015 GMMP was able to make comparisons across the 20 years in which it has been operating. Despite women's considerable advancement over the past two decades in the public and [[private sector]]s, female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent). Where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[spokesperson]]s and 19 per cent of experts featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The underepresentation of women in media content extends across regions. Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in North America, followed by the Caribbean (29 per cent) and Latin America (27 per cent). In the southern African region, Gender Links’ latest Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women's views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Sarah Macharia, even if more women appear in media, there may be limited impact on the entrenched biases and stereotypes present in media content. This can promote narrow gender roles that limit the choices and options available to everyone. This is why many actors continue to encourage all media workers to become more gender-sensitive through training and internal [[Policy|policies]] that monitor coverage and promote greater awareness of gender issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The picture for women in media ===
Women's accomplishments in the media sector have long remained under-recognized by traditional professional and news organizations, a trend that remains unchanged. Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Christina. 2016.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations, mostly gender focused, have launched dedicated prizes to recognize achievements of women in media. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]] continues to recognize the courageous work of women journalists. In 2007, the [[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]’ began giving out the EDA Awards annually to recognize women filmmakers and [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]]. More recently, in 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank. 2015.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the way in which women’s contribution to the news environment is made visible, the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poynter Institute]] since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.poynter.org/training-events/leadership-academy-women-digital-media&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives have begun to appear in other regions. UNESCO has also led workshops media professionals and community media in Gabon and Burundi, as part of its global efforts to enhance gender equality in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kenmoe, Elvis Michel. 2016.

== Media independence ==
'''Media independence''' is the capacity of a news outlet to provide accurate and [[Bias|unbiased]] information to the public. In a 2016 study of board members’ views in North America and Western Europe on the introduction of quotas, for example, individuals whose organizations (and countries) were committed to actions to increase women's representation were enthusiastic about the effects; but in contrast, individuals working in contexts without such commitments were rarely keen to embrace such strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersema and Mors, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing issues around gender and media independence, a number of advocacy and media monitoring initiatives have developed over the past few years that provide data on persistent gender inequalities. Media unions at local, national, regional and global levels have been prominent in working to protect the interests of women media workers, initiating women's [[caucus]]es, appointing women's officers, establishing women's conferences and developing handbooks of good practice. [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ), for example, has a Gender Council (GC) which co-ordinates its gender-focused work. Since its inception, the GC has been IFJ's main vehicle to guide projects; formulate policy concerning gender and good practice; and advocate for and mainstream gender-based issues throughout IFJ, its projects and its member unions.  During its 2016 Congress, the work of the GC was officially enshrined and protected through inclusion in the IFJ Constitution. Women media professionals themselves have also been active in forming their own networks to support and encourage each other, organizing events, developing mentoring schemes and initiating awards that recognize women's accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Journalists. 2017.

=== Gender equality in the media workplace ===
Research over the past two decades on the working conditions of women media professionals has mostly shown that women sometimes face hostility in the [[newsroom]], which can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to gender equality and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of women in the news media, cited in the previous chapter, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries. The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place. Media houses with such policies in place typically lacked mechanisms to monitor their effectiveness, thereby limiting their potential to effect change. The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations.

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===
In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms.

The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote ‘gender equality in and through the media’ in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa.

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.

The [[FEMNET|African Women's Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled ‘Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia’. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].

In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its [[Arabic]] acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and [[Civic engagement|civic participation]].

=== Formal and informal professional associations ===
A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.&lt;ref&gt;https://allwomeninmedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women’s issues. A more regionally focused example is the [[Marie Colvin]] Journalists’ Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the [[Arab world]] that aims to assist vulnerable local [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or [[Psychology|psychological]] care.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/weiter/category/reports/&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Working in the Coal Mine'''" is a song with music and lyrics by the American musician and [[record producer]] [[Allen Toussaint]].  It was an international hit for [[Lee Dorsey]] in 1966, and has been recorded by other musicians including [[Devo]] in 1981.

==Lee Dorsey==
After Toussaint returned to New Orleans from the [[US Army]], in which he served from 1963 to 1965, he formed a production company, Sansu (also known as "Tou-Sea Productions"), with partner [[Marshall Sehorn]].  He produced a number of singles performed by [[Lee Dorsey]] in 1965 and 1966, including "Ride Your Pony" and "Working in the Coal Mine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=200 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123092505/http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=200 |date=November 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written, arranged and produced by Toussaint, the song concerns the suffering of a man who rises before 5 o'clock each morning in order to work in a [[coal mine]], five days a week, where the conditions are very harsh and dangerous, but which offers the only prospect of paid employment. The singer repeatedly asks the Lord, "How long can this go on?" and complains that when the weekend arrives, he's too exhausted to have any fun. In the instrumental section, as in the song's fade, he says: "Lord, I'm so tired / How long can this go on?"   The song features the sound of a [[pickaxe]] clinking, as if the musicians were working in a mine.  Says producer Allen Toussaint "There wasn’t as much percussion as you might think on there. It was a certain drummer and we had my brother hit the mic' stand with a drum stick for the pick sound. Those were the two percussion instruments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.offbeat.com/articles/masters-of-louisiana-music-allen-toussaint/|title=Masters of Louisiana Music: Allen Toussaint  - OffBeat Magazine|newspaper=OffBeat Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recording took place at [[Cosimo Matassa]] Governor Nichols Street studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Musicians included guitarist [[Roy Montrell]], drummer [[June Gardner|Albert "June" Gardner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/songs.php?sid=3945&amp;perfid=12047 |title=The Penguin Discography: Working In The Coal Mine |publisher=Discog.fleetwoodmac.net |date=2006-08-10 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drummerszone.com/news/article/artist-news-1-8502/in-memoriam:-albert-'june'-gardner |title=Drummerszone news - In memoriam: Albert \"June\" Gardner |publisher=Drummerszone.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bassist [[Walter Payton (musician)|Walter Payton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rosebudus.com/2009/toussaint/BrightMississippi.html|title=Allen Toussaint|website=rosebudus.com|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a hit for Lee Dorsey, released on [[Amy Records]] (catalogue number 958), and entered the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on July 23, 1966, eventually peaking at #8, while reaching #5 on the [[Billboard R&amp;B chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reached #8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="betts"&gt;{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toussaint said that neither he nor Dorsey had ever been down a coal mine: "We didn’t know anything about a coal mine".  He said of Dorsey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He was very good to work with. Very inspiring because he had such a happiness about him. He loved what he was doing when he was singing. He was a body and fender man when he wasn’t singing and even at his peak, when he would come off the road at the end of a successful tour, he would go and get into his grease clothes, his dirty work gear and go and work on cars. Straightening out fenders and painting bodywork. But really it was his finest hour when he was singing. He was a very good person for me to work with and he totally trusted me every step of the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15059-allen-toussaint-interview |title=Features &amp;#124; A Quietus Interview &amp;#124; Born To Do This: Allen Toussaint Interviewed |publisher=The Quietus |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a [[Devo]] cover version was included as a bonus 7" single packaged with their album ''[[New Traditionalists]]''. This version was later included in the soundtracks for the films ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082509/soundtrack|publisher=IMDb.com |title=Soundtrack for Heavy Metal|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Employee of the Month (2006 film)|Employee of the Month]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424993/soundtrack|publisher=IMDb.com |title=Soundtrack for Employee of the Month|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It entered Billboard Sept 5, 1981, reaching No.43 on the Hot 100, and was also a Top 10 single in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Devo&amp;titel=Working+In+The+Coal+Mine&amp;cat=s |title=Devo - Working In The Coal Mine |publisher=charts.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as the theme for the show ''[[Working (TV series)|Working]]''.
