'''Agarose gel electrophoresis''' is a method of [[gel electrophoresis]] used in [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], and [[clinical chemistry]] to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of [[agarose]], one of the two main components of [[agar]]. The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size ([[isoelectric focusing]] agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] fragments by length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kryndushkin DS, Alexandrov IM, Ter-Avanesyan MD, Kushnirov VV | title = Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 49 | pages = 49636–43 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14507919 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M307996200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomolecules are separated by applying an [[electric field]] to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories, which accounts for the popularity of its use. The separated DNA may be viewed with stain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease. Most agarose gels used are between 0.7–2% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer.

==Properties of agarose gel==
[[File:Two percent Agarose Gel in Borate Buffer cast in a Gel Tray (Front, angled).jpg|right|thumb|An agarose gel cast in tray used for gel electrophoresis]]

[[Agarose]] gel is a three-dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three-dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1  |page=5.4 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3-D structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state. The melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature, depending on the sources, agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35–42&amp;nbsp;°C and a melting temperature of 85–95&amp;nbsp;°C. Low-melting and low-gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available.

Agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength, making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of DNA and large protein molecules. The pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 200–500&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name="zimm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=viovy&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume= 72 |pages= 813–872 |year=2000 |title=Electrophoresis of DNA and other polyelectrolytes: Physical mechanisms|author =Jean-Louis Viovy  |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.72.813 |bibcode=2000RvMP...72..813V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 0.15% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="serwer"/&gt; Low-concentration gels (0.1–0.2%) however are fragile and therefore hard to handle. Agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for DNA but has a greater range of separation, and is therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50–20,000 bp in size. The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.2–5.3  |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to separate large proteins, and it is the preferred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5–10&amp;nbsp;nm. A 0.9% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name="serwer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agarose gels: Properties and use for electrophoresis |author =Philip Serwer |journal=Electrophoresis |volume = 4 |issue =6 |pages =375–382 |year= 1983 |doi=10.1002/elps.1150040602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agarose polymer contains charged groups, in particular [[pyruvate]] and [[sulphate]].&lt;ref name="lonza"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bio.lonza.com/uploads/tx_mwaxmarketingmaterial/Lonza_BenchGuides_SourceBook_Appendix_B_-_Agarose_Physical_Chemistry.pdf |title=Appendix B: Agarose Physical Chemistry |work=Lonza Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of DNA in a process called [[electroendosmosis]] (EEO), and can therefore retard the movement of DNA and cause blurring of bands. Higher concentration gels would have higher electroosmotic flow. Low EEO agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose [[gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids]], but high EEO agarose may be used for other purposes. The lower sulphate content of low EEO agarose, particularly low-melting point (LMP) agarose, is also beneficial in cases where the DNA extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures, such as [[ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].  Zero EEO agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged groups and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.7 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Electroendosmosis is a reason agarose is used in preference to [[agar]] as the [[agaropectin]] component in agar contains a significant amount of negatively charged sulphate and carboxyl groups. The removal of agaropectin in agarose substantially reduces the EEO, as well as reducing the non-specific adsorption of biomolecules to the gel matrix.  However, for some applications such as the electrophoresis of serum proteins, a high EEO may be desirable, and agaropectin may be added in the gel used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-bZ_FZHqRcC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Protein Electrophoresis in Clinical Diagnosis|first= David |last=Keren |pages=7–8 |publisher=CRC Press |date=26 September 2003|isbn=978-0340812136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration of nucleic acids in agarose gel==
{{main article|Gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids}}

===Factors affecting migration of nucleic acid in gel===
[[File:Plasmid miniprep.jpg|thumb|280px|Gels of plasmid preparations usually show a major band of supercoiled DNA with other fainter bands in the same lane. Note that by convention DNA gel is displayed with smaller DNA fragments nearer to the bottom of the gel. This is because historically DNA gels were run vertically and the smaller DNA fragments move downwards faster.]]

A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores (gel concentration), size of DNA being electrophoresed, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. Lucotte |author2=F. Baneyx |title= Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques |page=32 | year=1993 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0471188490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel, and double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of base pairs. This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments, and separation of very large DNA fragments requires the use of [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE), which applies alternating current from two different directions and the large DNA fragments are separated as they reorient themselves with the changing current.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee PY, Costumbrado J, Hsu CY, Kim YH | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 62 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22546956 | pmc = 4846332 | doi = 10.3791/3923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For standard agarose gel electrophoresis, larger molecules are resolved better using a low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel. High concentrations gel however requires longer run times (sometimes days).

The movement of the DNA may be affected by the [[Chemical structure|conformation]] of the DNA molecule, for example, [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled DNA]] usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6Yd-qYvx9UC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DNA Structure and Function |author = Richard R. Sinden |page= 97 |publisher=Academic Press Inc. |isbn=978-0126457506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band, while nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands. The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions,&lt;ref name=sambrook1&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.5-5.6 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aaij C, Borst P | title = The gel electrophoresis of DNA | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 269 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–200 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 5063906 | doi = 10.1016/0005-2787(72)90426-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence in gel during electrophoresis can affect its movement. For example, the positive charge of ethidium bromide can reduce the DNA movement by 15%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |author1=Donald Voet |author2=Judith G. Voet |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=877–878 |year=1995 |isbn=978-0471586517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA damage due to increased [[cross-link]]ing will also reduce electrophoretic DNA migration in a dose-dependent way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blasiak J, Trzeciak A, Malecka-Panas E, Drzewoski J, Wojewódzka M | title = In vitro genotoxicity of ethanol and acetaldehyde in human lymphocytes and the gastrointestinal tract mucosa cells | journal = Toxicology in Vitro | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 287–95 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10906435 | doi = 10.1016/S0887-2333(00)00022-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu Y, Morimoto K | title = Is habitual alcohol drinking associated with reduced electrophoretic DNA migration in peripheral blood leukocytes from ALDH2-deficient male Japanese? | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–8 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19286920 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/gep008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of migration of the DNA is proportional to the voltage applied, i.e. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. The resolution of large DNA fragments however is lower at high voltage. The mobility of DNA may also change in an unsteady field – in a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency.&lt;ref name="zimm"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimm BH, Levene SD | title = Problems and prospects in the theory of gel electrophoresis of DNA | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–204 | date = May 1992 | pmid = 1518924 | doi = 10.1017/s0033583500004662 | url = http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/ufk_papers/electrokinetics/zimm.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon can result in band inversion in field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE), whereby larger DNA fragments move faster than smaller ones.

===Migration anomalies===
* "Smiley" gels - this edge effect is caused when the voltage applied is too high for the gel concentration used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. Lucotte |author2=F. Baneyx |title= Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques |page=41 | year=1993 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0471188490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Overloading of DNA - overloading of DNA slows down the migration of DNA fragments.
* Contamination - presence of impurities, such as salts or proteins can affect the movement of the DNA.

===Mechanism of migration and separation===

The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis.&lt;ref name="zimm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old &amp; primrose"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principle of Gene Manipulation - An Introduction to Genetic Engineering |author1=Robert W. Old |author2=Sandy B. Primrose |page=9 |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |edition=5th |isbn=9780632037124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix. A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a [[random coil]] DNA moves through the interconnected pores, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.&lt;ref name="zimm" /&gt;

The Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a [[reptation]] model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a "snake-like" fashion (hence "reptation") through the pores as an elongated molecule. A biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along.&lt;ref name="microfluidics"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wyBp-vKbdcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Microfluidics for Biological Applications |editor1=Tian, Wei-Cheng |editor2=Finehout, Erin |chapter=Chapter 4 - Genetic Analysis in Miniaturized Electrophoresis Systems |author1=Li Zhu |author2=Hong Wang |page=125 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09480-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules, however, showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SB, Aldridge PK, Callis JB | title = Observation of individual DNA molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4888 | pages = 203–6 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2911733 | doi = 10.1126/science.2911733 | bibcode = 1989Sci...243..203S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz DC, Koval M | title = Conformational dynamics of individual DNA molecules during gel electrophoresis | journal = Nature | volume = 338 | issue = 6215 | pages = 520–2 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2927511 | doi = 10.1038/338520a0 | bibcode = 1989Natur.338..520S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General procedure==

The details of an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment may vary depending on methods, but most follow a general procedure.
[[File:Agarose Gel Electrophoresis - Assembling the Rig and Loading-Running the Gel.webm|thumb|none|Video showing assembly of the rig and loading/running of the gel.]]

===Casting of gel===
[[File:Loading DNA samples into an agarose gel for electrophoresis - CPHST - USDA photo.jpg|thumb|180px|Loading DNA samples into the wells of an agarose gel using a multi-channel pipette.]]

The gel is prepared by dissolving the agarose powder in an appropriate buffer, such as TAE or TBE, to be used in electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agarose Gel Electrophoresis for the Separation of DNA Fragments |url=http://www.jove.com/video/3923/agarose-gel-electrophoresis-for-the-separation-of-dna-fragments |author1=Pei Yun Lee |author2=John Costumbrado |author3=Chih-Yuan Hsu |author4=Yong Hoon Kim |publisher=The Journal of Visualized Experiments |pmid= 22546956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agarose is dispersed in the buffer before heating it to near-boiling point, but avoid boiling. The melted agarose is allowed to cool sufficiently before pouring the solution into a cast as the cast may warp or crack if the agarose solution is too hot. A comb is placed in the cast to create wells for loading sample, and the gel should be completely set before use.

The concentration of gel affects the resolution of DNA separation. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.8% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments. 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agarose gel electrophoresis (basic method) |url=http://www.methodbook.net/dna/agarogel.html|work=Biological Protocols|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used (g/ml). High percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly, while low percentage gels (0.1-0.2%) are fragile and not easy to handle. Low-melting-point (LMP) agarose gels are also more fragile than normal agarose gel.  Low-melting point agarose may be used on its own or simultaneously with standard agarose for the separation and isolation of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fotadar U, Shapiro LE, Surks MI | title = Simultaneous use of standard and low-melting agarose for the separation and isolation of DNA by electrophoresis | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–2 | date = February 1991 | pmid = 2059440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PFGE and FIGE are often done with high percentage agarose gels.

===Loading of samples===
Once the gel has set, the comb is removed, leaving wells where DNA samples can be loaded. Loading buffer is mixed with the DNA sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells. The loading buffer contains a dense compound, which may be glycerol, sucrose, or [[Ficoll]], that raises the density of the sample so that the DNA sample may sink to the bottom of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee PY, Costumbrado J, Hsu CY, Kim YH | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | volume = 62 | issue = 62 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22546956 | pmc = 4846332 | doi = 10.3791/3923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation, it may float out of the well. The loading buffer also includes colored dyes such as [[xylene cyanol]] and [[bromophenol blue]] used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA samples are loaded using a [[pipette]].

===Electrophoresis===
[[File:Electrophoresis - Moving along gel.jpg|thumb|Agarose gel slab in electrophoresis tank with bands of dyes indicating progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA moves towards anode.]]
Agarose gel electrophoresis is most commonly done horizontally in a submarine mode whereby the slab gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis. It is also possible, but less common, to perform the electrophoresis vertically, as well as horizontally with the gel raised on agarose legs using an appropriate apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |author =David Freifelder |edition=2nd |year=1982 |publisher=WH Freeman |pages= 292–293 |isbn= 978-0716714446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buffer used in the gel is the same as the running buffer in the electrophoresis tank, which is why electrophoresis in the submarine mode is possible with agarose gel.

For optimal resolution of DNA greater than 2{{Spaces}}kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis, 5 to 8 V/cm is recommended (the distance in cm refers to the distance between electrodes, therefore this recommended voltage would be 5 to 8 multiplied by the distance between the electrodes in cm).&lt;ref name=sambrook1/&gt;   Voltage may also be limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if it is run at high voltage for a prolonged period, especially if the gel used is LMP agarose gel. Too high a voltage may also reduce resolution, as well as causing band streaking for large DNA molecules. Too low a voltage may lead to broadening of band for small DNA fragments due to dispersion and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bio.lonza.com/uploads/tx_mwaxmarketingmaterial/Lonza_BenchGuides_SourceBook_Section_III_-_Loading_and_Running_DNA_in_Agarose_Gels.pdf |title=Section III: Loading and Running DNA in Agarose Gels |work=Lonza Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since DNA is not visible in natural light, the progress of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes. Xylene cyanol (light blue color) comigrates large DNA fragments, while Bromophenol blue (dark blue) comigrates with the smaller fragments. Less commonly used dyes include [[Cresol Red]] and [[Orange G]] which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue. A [[Molecular weight size marker|DNA marker]] is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. Note however that the size of a circular DNA like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by [[restriction digest]], alternatively a supercoiled DNA marker may be used.

===Staining and visualization===
[[Image:AgarosegelUV.jpg|thumb| The gel with UV illumination: DNA stained with [[ethidium bromide]] appears as glowing orange bands.]]

DNA as well as RNA are normally visualized by staining with [[ethidium bromide]], which intercalates into the major grooves of the DNA and fluoresces under UV light. The intercalation depends on the concentration of DNA and thus, a band with high intensity will indicate a higher amount of DNA compared to a band of less intensity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels, or the DNA gel may be stained later after electrophoresis. Destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images. Other methods of staining are available; examples are [[SYBR Green I|SYBR Green]], [[GelRed]], [[methylene blue]], [[brilliant cresyl blue]], [[Nile blue]] sulphate, and [[crystal violet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/protocols/DNA/PDF/DNA14.pdf |title=DNA revealed |work=National Centre for Biotechnology education |publisher=University of Reading |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304065032/http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/PROTOCOLS/DNA/PDF/DNA14.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SYBR Green, GelRed and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it has been shown to be [[mutagenic]] in [[Ames test]], although the [[carcinogenicity]] of ethidium bromide has not actually been established. SYBR Green requires the use of a blue-light transilluminator. DNA stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a UV transilluminator which is an advantage, however it may not produce a strong band.

When stained with ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an [[ultraviolet]] (UV) transilluminator. The UV light excites the electrons within the aromatic ring of ethidium bromide, and once they return to the ground state, light is released, making the DNA and ethidium bromide complex fluoresce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of [[Transformation efficiency|transformation]], ''in vitro'' [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gründemann D, Schömig E | title = Protection of DNA during preparative agarose gel electrophoresis against damage induced by ultraviolet light | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 898–903 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8922632 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00009/96215rr02_9961a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365&amp;nbsp;nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.

The transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices, such as a digital or polaroid camera, that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed.

For gel electrophoresis of protein, the bands may be visualised with [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie]] or [[Silver stain|silver stains]].

===Downstream procedures===
The separated DNA bands are often used for further procedures, and a DNA band may be cut out of the gel as a slice, dissolved and purified. Contaminants however may affect some downstream procedures such as PCR, and low melting point agarose may be preferred in some cases as it contains fewer of the sulphates that can affect some enzymatic reactions. The gels may also be used for blotting techniques.

==Buffers==
In general, the ideal buffer should have good conductivity, produce less heat and have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gel electrophoresis – Principles and Basics |editor=Sameh Magdeldin |year=2012 |publisher=InTech |isbn=978-953-51-0458-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis; common ones for nucleic acids include [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE) and [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE).   The buffers used contain EDTA to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function. The borate in TBE buffer can be problematic as borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity, but it provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product.

Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]] (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Tris-phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if DNA extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM lithium borate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody JR, Kern SE | title = History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 333 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15351274 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121224121719/http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | deadurl = yes | archivedate = 24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other buffering system may be used in specific applications, for example, barbituric acid-sodium barbiturate or Tris-[[Barbital|barbiturate]] buffers may be used for in agarose gel electrophoresis of proteins, for example in the detection of abnormal distribution of proteins.&lt;ref name="jeppson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeppsson JO, Laurell CB, Franzén B | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–38 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 313856 | url = http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/25/4/629.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following digestion with [[restriction enzyme]]s, e.g. in [[Restriction map|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.
*Analysis of products of a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]
*Separation of DNA fragments for extraction and purification.
*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].
*Separation of proteins, for example, screening of protein abnormalities in [[clinical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dmbj.org.rs/jmb/pdf/2010-1/2.pdf |title=Agarose gel electrophoresis: Application in Clinial Chemistry |work=Journal of Medical Biochemistry |doi=10.2478/v10011-009-0033-8 |volume=29|pages= 9–14|date= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides biological [[evolution]] were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

==History of usage==
{{Life timeline}}
The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooper (physician)|Robert Hooper]], M.D. (1839) ''A New Medical Dictionary Containing the Explanation of the Terms in Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacy, Practice of Physic, Surgery, Materia Medica, Midwifery, and the Various Branches of Natural Philosophy Connected with Medicine''. Philadelphia: M. Carey &amp; Son, Benjamin Warner, and Edward Parker. Griggs &amp; Company Printers.&lt;/ref&gt; and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|authorlink=Otis T. Mason|year=1880|title=Sketch of North American Anthropology in 1879|url=|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|volume=14|issue=5|pages=348–356|doi=10.1086/272557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].&lt;ref name="gregory" /&gt; There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 2008. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|authorlink=Ajit Varki|authorlink2=Daniel Geschwind|authorlink3=Evan Eichler|last2=Geschwind|first2=Daniel|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|year=2008|title = Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture|url=|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=9|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1038/nrg2428|pmc=2756412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now back in academic use at the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">The '''Art dans Tout''' movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Felix Aubert, Art dans Tout, and Art Nouveau Lace|jstor = 40662780|journal = Studies in the Decorative Arts|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 37–76|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = ROSSELLA|last = FROISSART-PEZONE|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wittman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer [[Félix Aubert]], sculptor and craftsman [[Alexandre Charpentier]], sculptor and medalist [[Jean Dampt]], sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect [[Charles Plumet]], it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter [[Étienne Moreau-Nélaton]] and architect and decorator [[Tony Selmersheim]]. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: A Research Guide for Design Reform in France, Belgium, England, and the United States|last = Weisberg|first = Gabriel P.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 184, 238|last2 = Menon|first2 = Elizabeth K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Desbois, a sculptor, [[Paul Follot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ketterer Kunst,  Art auctions, Book auctions Munich, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|url = http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/paul-follot-1877.php|website = www.kettererkunst.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, [[Henri Sauvage]], an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.&lt;ref name="Arwas"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: The French Aesthetic|last = Arwas|first = Victor|publisher = Papadakis Publisher|year = 2002|isbn = 9781901092370|location = |pages = 321, 616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

With the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc]]. Followers of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'ART DANS TOUT - Les arts décoratifs en France et l'utopie d'un Art nouveau|last=Froissart Pezone|first=Rossella|publisher=CNRS Éditions|year=2005|isbn=9782271062819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Décoration &amp; Le Rationalisme Architecturaux a L'Exposition Universelle|last = Clausen|first = M.

== Les Cinq ==
Les Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Les Six ==
In December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.

== Art dans Tout ==
The group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-group activities ==

Although the group disbanded in 1901 due to financial issues, and an inability to convince major furniture manufacturers to use their designs, several group members continued to collaborate, notably Plumet and Selmersheim.&lt;ref name="Arwas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'utopie de l'art pour tous {{!}} L'Histoire|url = http://www.histoire.presse.fr/actualite/infos/l-utopie-de-l-art-pour-tous-01-06-2005-6471|website = www.histoire.presse.fr|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1925">A "'''cerebral rubicon'''" in paleontology is the minimum [[cranial capacity]] required for a specimen to be classified as a certain [[paleospecies]] or genus.  The term is mostly used in reference to human evolution.&lt;ref name=dirt&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Andrew |url=http://livelikedirt.blogspot.com/2015/01/homo-files-cerebral-rubicon.html |title=Live Like Dirt: Homo files: the cerebral rubicon |publisher=Livelikedirt.blogspot.com |date=2015-01-02 |accessdate=2016-04-11 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Scottish anthropologist Sir [[Arthur Keith]] set the limit at 750 cc for the genus ''Homo''.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt; The minimum cranial capacity for the species [[Homo sapiens]] is generally set at 900cc.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt;

One of the reasons for the proposal to exclude ''[[Homo habilis]]'' from the genus ''Homo'', and renaming it as "''Australopithecus habilis''", is the small capacity of their cranium (363cc -600 cc).

==Origin==
The term is most likely a reference to the [[Rubicon]] river, which in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] marked the border between [[Gaul|Cisapline Gaul]] and Italy proper.  Crossing the river with an army, as [[Julius Caesar]] did in 49 B.C., was illegal by Roman law and is commonly seen as the "point-of-no-return" for Caesar's revolution.  As such, a "rubicon" can  be used [[idiom]]atically as any strict dividing line or point-of-no-return.

== Use in conservation ==
Charismatic species are often used as [[flagship species]] in conservation programs, as they are supposed to attract people's feelings more.&lt;ref name="Charisma"/&gt; However, being charismatic does not protect species against [[extinction]]: all of the 10 most charismatic species are currently [[endangered]], and only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population.&lt;ref name=Courchamp2018/&gt;

Beginning early in the 20th century, efforts to reintroduce extirpated charismatic megafauna to ecosystems have been an interest of a number of private and non-government conservation organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miller |first=C.

A. |author3=Jędrzejewska, B. |author4=Krasiński, Z. A. |author5=Niedziałkowska, M. |author6=Kamler, J. F. |author7=Yoccoz, N. G. |author8=Stenseth, N.

These and other reintroductions of charismatic megafauna, such as [[Przewalski's horse]] to [[Mongolia]], have been to areas of limited, and often patchy range compared to the historic ranges of the respective species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rugenstein | first =Dustin R. |author2=Rubenstein, Daniel I. |author3=Sherman, Paul W. |author4=Gavin, Thomas A.  |title=Pleistocene Park: Does re-wilding North America represent sound conservation for the 21st century? |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=232–238 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental activists and proponents of [[ecotourism]] seek to use the leverage provided by charismatic and well-known species to achieve more subtle and far-reaching goals in species and biodiversity conservation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} By directing public attention to the diminishing numbers of giant panda due to [[habitat loss]], for example, conservation groups can raise support for the protection of the panda and for the entire [[ecosystem]] of which it is a part.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} (The giant panda is portrayed in the logo of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].)

== Taxonomic bias ==
Charismatic megafauna may be subject to [[taxonomic inflation]], in that taxonomists will declare a [[subspecies]] to be a [[species]] because of the advocacy benefits of a unique species, rather than because of new scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9191545 "Species inflation: Hail Linnaeus"], ''[[The Economist]]'', May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The public's preference to identify with species sold through the [[ecotourism]] industry may be a factor for creating taxonomic inflation.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; In the public perception, ecotourism may be about seeing species, and the number of unique species increases the perceived [[biodiversity]] and tourism [[Value (economics)|value]] of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Higham | first =James | title = Critical Issues in Ecotourism: understanding a complex tourism phenomenon | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year =2007 |location = |pages =76–77 | isbn =0-7506-6878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Weaver | first=D. | title=Ecotourism | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia Ltd |year=2002 |isbn =0-471-42230-4 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation may exist between the taxonomic bias in biodiversity datasets and the charisma of terrestrial megafauna, with the more charismatic species being largely over-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Monsarrat |last2 =Kerley| first1=S. | first2=G.I.H | title=Charismatic species of the past: Biases in reporting of large mammals in historical written sources| journal= Biological Conservation |year=2018| volume=223 | DOI= 10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.036 | page=68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venenivibrio.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Venenivibrio stagnispumantis]]'' gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen gas.]]

In biochemistry, '''chemosynthesis''' is the biological conversion of one or more carbon-containing molecules (usually [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]]) and nutrients into organic matter using the [[oxidation]] of inorganic compounds (e.g., [[hydrogen]] gas, [[hydrogen sulfide]]) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in [[photosynthesis]]. [[Chemotroph|Chemoautotrophs]], [[organism]]s that obtain carbon through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but also groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon [[proteobacteria]], the [[Aquificae]], the [[methanogen]]ic archaea and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.

Many microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans use chemosynthesis to produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be distinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are available, the energy available from the reaction between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (leading to production of methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which substances such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[ammonia]] are oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.

Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic [[secondary production]] at [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[methane clathrate]]s, [[cold seep]]s, [[whale fall]]s, and [[Movile Cave|isolated cave water]].

It has been hypothesized that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of [[Mars]], [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Chela-Flores]] (2000): "Terrestrial microbes as candidates for survival on Mars and Europa", in: Seckbach, Joseph (ed.) ''Journey to Diverse Microbial Worlds: Adaptation to Exotic Environments'', Springer, pp. 387–398. {{ISBN|0-7923-6020-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

&lt;!--I am commenting this out because the reaction is wrong (it is unbalanced in oxygen) and since there's no reference. Thermodynamically it shouldn't be possible to make glucose and sulfur from CO2, H2S, and water. Eric Kvaalen Chemosynthesis may have also been the first type of metabolism that evolved on Earth, leading the way for cellular respiration and photosynthesis to develop later.

==Process==
An example of a chemosynthesis reaction using hydrogen sulfide proceeds as follows:
::6CO₂ + 6H₂S → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6S
This reaction is used by bacteria inhabiting [[hydrothermal vent]]s to generate C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[carbohydrate]].

End of commented out section.--&gt;

==Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis process==
[[Giant tube worm]]s use bacteria in their [[trophosome]] to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]] (using [[hydrogen sulfide]] as an energy source) and produce sugars and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biotechnology for Environmental Management and Resource Recovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYJEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179 |publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9788132208761|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some reactions produce sulfur:

::12'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt; + 6C&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbohydrate]]) + 6'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt; + 12S
Instead of releasing [[oxygen]] gas while fixing carbon dioxide as in [[photosynthesis]], hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis produces solid globules of [[sulfur]] in the process. In bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy (a form a chemosynthesis), such as [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/304494953|title=The purple phototrophic bacteria|date=2009|publisher=Springer|others=Hunter, C. Neil, 1954-|isbn=9781402088148|location=Dordrecht|oclc=304494953}}&lt;/ref&gt;, yellow globules of sulfur are present and visible in the cytoplasm.

==Discovery==
[[File:Gollner Riftia pachyptila.png|right|thumb| Giant tube worms (''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'') have an organ containing chemosynthetic bacteria instead of a gut.]]
In 1890, [[Sergei Winogradsky|Sergei Nikolaevich Vinogradskii]] (or Winogradsky) proposed a novel type of life process called "anorgoxydant". His discovery suggested that some microbes could live solely on inorganic matter and emerged during his physiological research in the 1880s in Strassburg and Zurich on sulfur, iron, and nitrogen bacteria.

In 1897, [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]] coined the term "chemosynthesis" for the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances, in association with [[autotrophy|autotrophic]] carbon dioxide assimilation - what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would be expanded to include also chemoorganoautotrophs, which are organisms that use organic energy substrates in order to assimilate carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Kellerman, M.Y., G. Wegener, M. Elvert, M.Y. Yoshinaga, Y-S. Lin, T. Holler, X.P. Millar, K. Knittel, and K-U. Hinrichs (2012). Autotrophy as a predominant mode of carbon fixation in anaerobic methane-oxidizing microbial communities. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109(47):19321-19326&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, chemosynthesis can be seen as a synonym of [[chemoautotrophy]].

The term "[[chemotroph]]y", less restrictive, would be introduced in the 1940s by [[André Lwoff]] for the production of energy by the oxidation of electron donors, organic or not, associated with auto- or heterotrophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. P., &amp; Wood, A. P. (2006). The chemolithotrophic prokaryotes. In: ''The prokaryotes'' (pp. 441-456). Springer New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kyAZ47ZrazkC&amp;pg].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, H.G. (1975). Mechanisms of
chemo-autotrophy. In: ''Marine ecology'', Vol. 2, Part I (O. Kinne, ed.), pp. 9-60, [http://www.int-res.com/archive/me_books/me_vol2_(physiological_mechanisms)_pt1.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrothermal vents===
The suggestion of Vinogradskii was confirmed nearly 90 years later, when hydrothermal [[ocean]] vents were predicted to exist in the 1970s. The hot springs and strange creatures were discovered by ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the world's first deep-sea submersible, in 1977 at the [[Galapagos Rift]]. At about the same time, Harvard graduate student [[Colleen Cavanaugh]] proposed chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize sulfides or elemental sulfur as a mechanism by which [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]] could survive near hydrothermal vents. Cavanaugh later managed to confirm that this was indeed the method by which the worms could thrive, and is generally credited with the discovery of chemosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cavenaugh, Colleen M., et al, "Prokaryotic Cells in the Hydrothermal Vent Tube Worms ''Rifttia'' Jones:Possible Chemoautotrophic Symbionts," ''Science,'' Vol 213, Issue 4505, 17 July 1981, pp. 340-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 [[television]] series hosted by [[Bill Nye]] named chemosynthesis as one of the 100 greatest scientific discoveries of all time.&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442715/ "100 Greatest Discoveries (2004-2005)"] ''IMDb''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm "Greatest Discoveries."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319001453/http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/greatest-discoveries/videos/evolution.htm |date=March 19, 2013 }}  ''Science''.  Watch the "Greatest Discoveries in Evolution" online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanic crust===
In 2013, researchers reported their discovery of bacteria living in the rock of the [[oceanic crust]] below the thick layers of sediment, and apart from the hydrothermal vents that form along the edges of the [[tectonic plate]]s.  Preliminary findings are that these bacteria subsist on the hydrogen produced by chemical reduction of [[olivine]] by seawater circulating in the small veins that permeate the [[basalt]] that comprises oceanic crust.  The bacteria synthesize methane by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314144340.htm  "Life deep within oceanic crust sustained by energy from interior of Earth", ''ScienceDaily'', retrieved March 16, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commenting this out since the reaction is dubious as I mentioned above.
The chemosynthetic reaction 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6S also helped to determine that it was water, rather than carbon dioxide, that generated oxygen in photosynthesis. This was because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was seen as analogous to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and sulfur bacteria produced sulfur rather than oxygen as a [[Metabolism|metabolic]] byproduct.

[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|lright|400px|A chord chart. {{audio|Chord chart.mid|Play}}]]
A '''chord chart''' (or '''chart''') is a form of [[musical notation]] that describes the basic [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[rhythmic]] information for a song or tune. It is the most common form of notation used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or [[popular music]]. It is intended primarily for a [[rhythm section]] (usually consisting of [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Bass guitar|bass]]). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to [[music improvisation|improvise]] the individual notes used for the [[chord (music)|chords]] (the "[[voicing (music)|voicing]]") and the appropriate [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], [[counter melody]] or [[bassline]].

In some chord charts, the harmony is given as a series of [[chord symbol]]s above a traditional [[musical staff]]. The rhythmic information can be very specific and written using a form of traditional notation, sometimes called '''rhythmic notation''', or it can be completely unspecified using '''slash notation''', allowing the musician to fill the bar with chords or fills any way he or she sees fit (called "[[comping]]"). In '''Nashville notation''' the [[key (music)|key]] is left unspecified on the chart by substituting numbers for chord names. This facilitates on-the-spot key changes to songs. Chord charts may also include explicit parts written in [[music notation|modern music notation]] (such as a musical riff that the song is dependent on for character), lyrics or lyric fragments, and various other information to help the musician compose and play their part.

==Rhythmic notation==

'''Rhythmic notation''' specifies the exact [[rhythm]] in which to play or [[comping|comp]] the indicated [[chord (music)|chords]]. The chords are written above the [[staff (music)|staff]] and the rhythm is indicated in the traditional manner, though [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is unspecified through the use of slashes placed on the center line instead of [[Musical note|note]]s. This is contrasted with the less specific '''slash notation'''.&lt;ref name="konowitz"&gt;Konowitz, Bert (1998). ''Teach Yourself Chords and Progressions at the Keyboard'', p.68-69. {{ISBN|0-7390-0017-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slash notation==&lt;!--[[Slash notation]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
{{redirect|Slash notation|chord inversions|Slash chord|the physics notation|Feynman slash notation}}

[[File:Slash notation 4-4.png|thumb|right|350px|Slash notation in 4/4 with a slash on each beat under a i7 iv7-V7 chord progression in B{{flat}} minor]]

'''Slash notation''' is a form of purposefully vague [[musical notation]] which indicates or requires that an [[accompaniment]] player or players improvise their own [[rhythm]] pattern or [[comping|comp]] according to the [[chord symbol]] given above the [[Staff (music)|staff]]. On the staff a [[slash notation|slash]] is placed on each beat (so that there are four slashes per measure in 4/4 time).&lt;ref name="konowitz" /&gt;

Slash notation and rhythmic notation may both be used in the same piece, for example, with the more specific rhythmic notation used in a section where the horn section is playing a specific melody or rhythmic figure that the pianist must support, and with slash notation written for the pianist for use underneath improvised soli.

==Nashville notation==
{{main|Nashville number system}}
Nashville notation or Nashville number system&lt;ref&gt;Gorow, Ron (2002). ''Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today's Musician'', p.251. 2nd Edition. {{ISBN|0-9629496-7-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of writing, or sketching out, musical ideas, using numbers in place of [[chord (music)|chord]] names.  For example, in the key of C major, the chord D minor 7 can be written as "2-&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;", "2m7", or "ii7". "The musicians in Nashville use the Nashville Number System almost exclusively for conveying a song's structure and arrangement in the recording studio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writethismusic.com/charts.htm |title="Nashville Number Charts", ''WriteThisMusic.com'' |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505105125/http://writethismusic.com/Charts.htm |archivedate=5 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the key of C, C=1, D=2, E=3, and so on for all seven notes in the key. Similarly, in the key of G, G=1, A=2, B=3, and so on up to F{{sharp}}=7.  So, the chord progression &lt;code&gt;C///F///G///C///&lt;/code&gt; in the key of C would correspond to &lt;code&gt;1///4///5///1///&lt;/code&gt; in Nashville notation, while &lt;code&gt;G///C///D///G///&lt;/code&gt; in the key of G would also become &lt;code&gt;1///4///5///1///&lt;/code&gt;.

This method of notation allows musicians who are familiar with basic [[music theory]] to play the same song in any key.

==Chord charts in computer files==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=October 2017}}
Chord charts can be represented in a schematic way as [[ASCII]] files, where bar lines are given as pipe symbols "|", chord symbols are approximated as text and beats may be indicated with a forward slash "/".

In this context, the term "chord chart" is also used to describe a [[lyrics|lyric]] sheet where [[chord symbol]]s are placed above the appropriate syllables of the lyrics to associate the relative timing of the chord changes to the words of a song, or it may refer to the handwritten lyrics with chords handwritten above them.

A '''comedian''' or '''comic''' is a person who seeks to [[entertainment|entertain]] an audience by making them [[Laughter|laugh]]. This might take many forms including [[Joke|jokes]], satirical observations, [[Amusement|amusing]] situations, acting foolish (as in [[Slapstick|slapstick]]) or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. Other practises include the [[sitcom]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[improvisational theatre|improv]].

A popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],&lt;ref name=Bartleby&gt;{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|accessdate=2008-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316092036/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny", which draws a distinction between how much of the [[comedy]] can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

A lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Monty Python]]. Current examples include [[Vic and Bob]], [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]]. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).

Since the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by [[punk subculture|punk culture]] and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. [[Ben Elton]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Malcolm Hardee]] and [[Alexi Sayle]] were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with [[Stewart Lee]] promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including [[The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society]] and [[Weirdos Comedy Club|the Weirdos Collective]].

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.

==History==
===Ancient Greeks===
{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}
Comedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespearean comedy===
{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}
The English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.

===Modern era===
[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]

[[Charlie Chaplin]] was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were protégés of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin wrote comedic [[silent films]] such as ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''. His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/msiegler.htm | title=Charlie Chaplin Biography | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=2 December 2013 | author=Sigler, Michael S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is [[stand-up comedy]]. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bob Hope]] was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span.  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Louis CK]] and [[Chris Rock]].

[[Radio]] has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] career began at a London radio station called [[XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)]] began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. [[The League of Gentlemen]], [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam &amp; Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, [[The Goon Show]] and [[Hancock's Half Hour]] being among the most popular early shows.

On television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Daniel Tosh]], [[Chris Hardwick]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].

Comedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].

==Jokes==
There are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12068221 BBC News - Ronnie Corbett Christmas Return]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw Russel Howard's Good News Extra]&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).

==Personality traits==
In a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored "significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs." Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, "the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."&lt;ref name=Kelland-Psychotic&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, labeling comedians' personality traits as "psychotic" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,&lt;ref name=Seubsaeng-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits—Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper-White&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.

{{distinguish|Computability logic}}
'''Computational logic''' is the use of [[logic]] to perform or reason about [[computation]]. It bears a similar relationship to [[computer science]] and engineering as [[mathematical logic]] bears to [[mathematics]] and as [[philosophical logic]] bears to [[philosophy]]. It is synonymous with "[[logic in computer science]]".

The term “Computational Logic” came to prominence with the founding of the [[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tocl.acm.org official website of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was apparently introduced by J.A. Robinson in a 1970 paper in the Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Machine Intelligence Workshop, Edinburgh, 1970, entitled "Computational Logic: The Unification Computation" (Machine Intelligence 6:63-72, Edinburgh University Press, 1971). The expression is used in the second paragraph with a footnote claiming that *computational logic* (the emphasis is in the paper) is "surely a better phrase than 'theorem proving', for the branch of artificial intelligence which deals with how to make machines do deduction efficiently". This sounds like coining the term; no reference to a previous use is mentioned. In 1972 the Metamathematics Unit at the University of Edinburgh was renamed “The Department of Computational Logic” in the School of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy/ Professor [[Alan Bundy]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; The term was then used by [[Robert S. Boyer]] and [[J Strother Moore]], who worked in the Department in the early 1970s, to describe their work on program verification and automated reasoning. They also founded a company [http://www.computationallogic.com/ Computational Logic Inc.] of the same name.

The term “Computational Logic” has also come to be associated with [[logic programming]], because much of the early work in logic programming in the early 1970s also took place in the Department of Computational Logic in Edinburgh. It was reused in the early 1990s to describe work on extensions of logic programming in the EU Basic Research Project “Compulog” and in the associated Network of Excellence. Krzysztof Apt, who was the co-ordinator of the Basic Research Project Compulog-II, reused and generalized the term when he founded the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic in 2000 and became its first Editor-in-Chief.

A '''digital conversation''' is a scripted dialogue (in other words it is dialogue written by a human, just like the script of a movie) which takes place between a person and a computer via any digital medium from [[web browsers]] and [[PDAs]] to [[mobile phones]] and [[Interactive television]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:MobileDigitalConvo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An example of a digital conversation being run on a mobile device]]
A digital conversation is scripted by a human, uploaded to a [[Server (computing)|server]] where it can be accessed as a [[web service]] by other humans (consumers, employees etc.) and used to impart information to them, whether that information is advising them on the best [[camera]] to buy, helping them tailor make a [[credit card]] or engaging them in an interactive book.

A digital conversation can be undertaken simultaneously from multiple digital channels. In other words, no matter what means you are using to access a digital conversation by, whether it's a browser or a mobile phone, you are calling the same digital conversation. This means that any changes made to a digital conversation are reflected across all channels immediately. This allows digital conversations to evolve.

Rather than throwing content at consumers, digital conversations are designed to engage them in a scripted conversation, to find out what they want and guide them to the outcome they desire. It is this Dialogue Marketing that many perceive as being the way forward, and digital conversations provide a solution to delivering this at scale.&lt;ref name= dialogue&gt;{{cite web |last= McDowall |first= Bob |title= Dialogue Marketing: Part 2 - a solution |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=7991 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves away from a traditional one way stream of information with a consumers (offering every consumer the same choices) and moves towards a dialogue, finding out what it is they want and giving it to them. This movement is seen as essential by many:

{{quote|"''The past two years have witnessed the first examples of true two-way marketing conversations between customers and some of the world’s leading consumer brands. Driven by a confluence of innovation, competition and big shifts in consumer behaviour, the dialogue between brands and their customers is replacing the traditional marketing monologue''"|''The Future of Marketing: From Monologue to Dialogue
The Economist, September 2006&lt;ref name= economist&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = An Economist Intelligence Unit white paper |title = The future of marketing From monologue to dialogue | year = 2006 | pages = 2 | publisher = The Economist | url = http://graphics.eiu.com/files/ad_pdfs/Google_Future_of_Marketing_060907.pdf|format=PDF | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"''I think things are going to get infinitely more complex and the challenge is about taking things that are infinitely more complex and making them simpler and more understandable''."|Robert M. Greenberg, Head of [[R/GA]]&lt;ref name= madison&gt;{{Cite news |last= O'Brien |first= Timothy L. |title= Madison Avenue's 30-Second Spot Remover |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= February 12, 2006 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/business/yourmoney/12adman.html?ex=1180670400&amp;en=6aa79cfc9a70f3ec&amp;ei=5070 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same New York Times article Robert M. Greenberg then states that he wants to "engage (consumers) in digital conversations that are so entertaining, involving and valuable that they won't want to ignore them."&lt;ref name= madison/&gt; The key word here is "engage". digital conversations are created to be, in essence, human interactions and dialogue with one human removed. Unlike [[Chatterbot|Bots]] and [[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s, digital conversations are scripted, and this may well lead to more human like interactions.

==The digital conversation Bio-System==
Digital conversations consist of a four-stage "bio-system":

'''Create''' - Consisting of the preliminary creation and refining of the digital conversation including its [[front and back ends|front end]]

'''Interact''' - Whereby consumers engage with the digital conversation

'''Understand''' - The usage data of every consumer engaged with a Conversation is automatically stored and aggregated and can be viewed quickly and easily

'''Adapt''' - This usage data may lead to changes to the digital conversation which are reflected in real time across all channels (as the Conversation is called from one source no matter what the medium accessing it).

==Creation: Scripting a digital conversation==
[[Image:DigitalConvoScript.png|thumb|300px|left|A standard scripting canvas for a digital conversation, each symbol represents a question, note, link or outcome]]

Each digital conversation is made up of a [[dialogue]] based script consisting of a narrative and choices with pathways that lead to Outcomes. It is the user, through their choices, who decides which pathway to follow. The script takes the form of a [[Decision tree|Decision-Tree]] and is the backbone of the digital conversation. Each Decision-Tree defines two or more Pathways. The end point of a Pathway is an Outcome or a loosely coupled Link to another digital conversation enabling longer digital conversation flows.

By embracing the concepts of [[Web 2.0]] and allowing infinite numbers of digital conversations to be linked, this can allow hugely complex subjects to be tackled. One digital conversation written by an expert in Europe can be linked to an existing digital conversation written by an expert in Africa. This allows in theory, vast knowledge landscapes made up of components.&lt;ref name= terry&gt;{{cite web|last= Schurter |first= Terry |title= There really are new ways to approach old problems |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=8499 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital conversation can contain good dialogue or bad dialogue. Good dialogue typically means the aggregated interaction of each Dialogue-Step is undertaken in less than 5 seconds. This means a person can read and understand a Dialogue-Step after one read through and wants to continue to the next Dialogue-Step.

Bad dialogue has the opposite effect. Unclear language, for example, can cause confusion and have an adverse effect on a user, worst-case scenario is when a user leaves a digital conversation in despair. Luckily thanks to the available Metrics, such problems can be spotted quickly (numerous users exiting on one particular step indicates an issue with that step) and acted upon, with the dialogue changed as and when needed.

So, the development of a good digital conversation which will engage users requires a combination of skills in particular:

&gt;&gt; Two-way communication

&gt;&gt; [[Decision tree|Decision-tree logic]]

&gt;&gt; [[Behavioural economics]]

A digital conversation can be created for any scripted dialogue, thus it is suited for marketing, sales, support, practices, guides, policies, procedures and much more.

==Interaction==
Thanks to the nature of digital conversations (that they can be accessed across multiple channels from the same source) there are numerous ways to interact with them, whether by browser (see image to the left), mobile phone (see image above) or even through voice.

Due to the Web Service nature of digital conversations, the [[front end processor (program)|front ends]] designed to access them can be extremely diverse (see Links section for a number of examples) and thus are able to reflect [[brand]]ing needs or the needs of the user (for example large type for partially sighted users).

One of the exciting recent developments has been the use of digital conversations to drive Avatars.

===''Web 4.0 Avatar''===
One of the trends of recent years has been the humanising of digital channels, giving a face to things which are not human. This has led to the creation of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] (also known as [[Internet bot|bot]]s or [[Internet bot|chatter-bots]]) artificial intelligences with which users can “converse”. The success of such bots varies greatly, there are few which respond in a convincingly human way, it is no great mystery why they are commonly referred to as “Bots” often resulting in a stilted, mechanical interaction where straying off a recognized path can lead to poor responses . However, this has not stopped their spread across the commercial world with several high-profile companies adopting them as part of their customer services.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DCAvatar.png|thumb|300px|right|A Web 2.0 Avatar in action]] --&gt;
Avatars such as [[IKEA]]'s Anna&lt;!--- this link no longer exists --[http://193.108.42.79/cgi-bin/IKEA_UK.cgi/]--&gt; have generated interest both in the business community and among the public. The idea of an artificial intelligence able to respond in an intelligent manner to your questions is indeed an exciting one. However, do these bots really manage it? Or are they just human faced Avatars disguising a search engine beneath?

Web 2.0 Avatars, powered by digital conversations, provide a level of immersion not found in these bots. Why? Because digital conversations are scripted just like any good book or film. And like books and films they are designed to guide a user, through high quality dialogue and interactions, to an outcome. Along with this, the ability to understand user interactions through DecisionMetrics means that these Web 2.0 Avatars can be adapted to emergent demands as they appear. The dialogue can be improved and built up as and when needed.

High quality dialogue, clear concise options for a user to choose and a humanized avatar all combine to create an immersive experience, with the psychological appeal of interacting with a character or object .

The key to immersion and believability is high quality dialogue, and it is high quality dialogue that digital conversations has been created for.

===''Business in the Virtual World''===
The digitlisation of business has been underway for years now, but the desire to do something more, to truly engage customers is growing stronger and stronger...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn from GE’s Digital Marketing Strategies |publisher=Kissmetrics |url=https://blog.kissmetrics.com/learn-from-ge-digital-marketing/ |accessdate=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]] have recently taken the initiative with this by creating a Virtual Business Centre in the Virtual World of [[Second Life]] which allows clients, partners and sales assistants to interact. It is areas like this that digital conversations might be put to use allowing users to interact with Avatars 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

==Understanding: Measurement and Metrics==
The automated recording of a digital conversation establishes the analytical science of interaction at scale. As a person interacts with a digital conversation Service each Dialogue-Step is recorded verbatim with a date and time step. Anonymous recording of consumers usage provides aggregated emergent patterns without infringing [[information privacy|data privacy]].

This measurement, providing the aggregated performance of each Dialogue-Step, Pathway and Outcome provides the scientific basis for Demand-Sensing allowing behavioral data to become quantifiable.

==Adaptation: Evolving Dialogue==
Once the usage data has been viewed and understood it may well be necessary to react by changing or amending the digital conversation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''ekpyrotic universe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|p|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɒ|t|ɪ|k}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=ekpyrotic| title = "ekpyrotic" | work = American Heritage Dictionary | accessdate = October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]] of the early [[universe]] that explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the [[cosmos]]. The model has also been incorporated in the '''cyclic universe''' theory (or '''ekpyrotic cyclic universe''' theory), which proposes a complete cosmological history, both the past and future.

== Origins ==

The original ekpyrotic model was introduced by [https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/justin-khoury Justin Khoury], [[Burt Ovrut]], [[Paul Steinhardt]] and [[Neil Turok]] in 2001. Steinhardt created the name based on the early word [[ekpyrosis]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἐκπύρωσις, ''ekpyrōsis'', "conflagration"); it refers to an ancient [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmological model in which the universe is caught in an eternal cycle of fiery birth, cooling and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;'The dissolution of the universe into fire'. In Stoic philosophy, ''ekpyrosis'', all-engulfing cosmic fire, represents the contractive phase of eternally-recurring destruction and re-creation. On "ekpyrosis" see generally [[Michael Lapidge]], 'Stoic Cosmology,' in John M. Rist, ''The Stoics,'' Cambridge University Press, 1978, pp. 161–186, pp. 180–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory addresses the fundamental question that remains unanswered by the [[big bang]] inflationary model: what happened before the big bang? The explanation, according to the ekpyrotic theory, is that the big bang was actually a big bounce, a transition from a previous epoch of contraction to the present epoch of expansion. The key events that shaped our universe occurred before the bounce, and, in a cyclic version, the universe bounces at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steinhardt | first1 = P. J. | last2=Turok | first2=N.| title = A Cyclic Model of the Universe | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 296 | issue = 5572 | pages = 1436–1439 | date = 2002-04-25 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5572/1436 | doi = 10.1126/science.1070462 | bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1436S | arxiv = hep-th/0111030 | pmid=11976408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of the theory ==

The original ekpyrotic models relied on [[string theory]], [[branes]] and [[extra dimension]]s, but most contemporary ekpyrotic and cyclic models use the same physical ingredients as inflationary models (quantum fields evolving in ordinary space-time). The theory has accurately described what is known so far about our universe. It predicts a uniform, flat universe with patterns of hot spots and cold spots now visible in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and has been confirmed by the [[WMAP]] and [[Planck satellite]] experiments. Discovery of the CMB was originally considered{{By whom|date=November 2017}} a landmark test{{Peacock term|date=March 2018}} of the big bang, but proponents of the ekpyrotic and cyclic theories have shown that the CMB is also consistent with a big bounce, as posited by the ekpyrotic and cyclic theories. The search for [[Cosmic microwave background#Primordial gravitational waves|primordial gravitational waves]] in the CMB may eventually help scientists distinguish between the rival theories, since the ekpyrotic and cyclic models predict that no primordial gravitational waves should be observed.

== Implications for cosmology ==

An advantage of ekpyrotic and cyclic models is that they do not produce a [[multiverse]]. This is important, because, when the effects of [[quantum fluctuations]] are properly included in the big bang inflationary model, they prevent the universe from achieving the uniformity and flatness that the cosmologists are trying to explain. Instead, inflated quantum fluctuations cause the universe to break up into patches with every conceivable combination of physical properties. Instead of making clear predictions, the big bang inflationary theory allows any outcome, so that the properties we observe may be viewed as random chance, resulting from the particular patch of the multiverse in which the Earth resides. Most regions of the multiverse would have very different properties.

Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg has suggested that if the multiverse is true, “the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our big bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/|title= Physics: What we do and don't know |last1= Weinberg |first1= Steven |date= November 20, 2007 |journal= The New York Review of Books |publisher= |location= |issn= |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the properties of our universe are an accident and come from a theory that allows a multiverse of other possibilities is hard to reconcile{{according to whom|date=March 2018}} with the fact that the universe is extraordinarily simple (uniform and flat) on large scales and that elementary [[particles]] appear to be described by simple symmetries and interactions. Also, the accidental concept cannot be falsified by an experiment since any future experiments can be viewed as yet other accidental aspects.

In ekpyrotic and cyclic models, smoothing and flattening occurs during a period of slow contraction, so quantum fluctuations are not inflated and cannot produce a multiverse. As a result, the ekpyrotic and cyclic models predict simple physical properties that are consistent with current experimental evidence without producing a multiverse. This makes these models valuable{{Peacock term|date=November 2017}} and, at the same time, vulnerable since they can be falsified by experiments.

'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding [[culture]] and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; p&amp;nbsp;547.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

Enculturation is related to [[socialization]]. In some academic fields, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

[[Conrad Phillip Kottak]] (in ''Window on Humanity'') writes:

{{quote|Enculturation is the process where the culture that is currently established teaches an individual the accepted norms and values of the culture or society where the individual lives. The individual can become an accepted member and fulfill the needed functions and roles of the group. Most importantly the individual knows and establishes a context of boundaries and accepted behavior that dictates what is acceptable and not acceptable within the framework of that society. It teaches the individual their role within society as well as what is accepted behavior within that society and lifestyle.}}

''Enculturation'' is sometimes referred to as ''[[acculturation]]'', a word recently used to more distinctively refer only to exchanges of cultural features with foreign cultures. Note that this is a recent development, as ''acculturation'' in some literatures has the same meaning as ''enculturation''.

== Environmental issues ==
The coral reefs are under threat due to environmental issues such as [[overfishing]], pollution, hurricanes, and disease. Since the 1970s, Jamaica's coral reef cover has declined more than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/02/caribbean-coral-reef-lost-fishing-pollution-report|title=Caribbean coral reefs ‘will be lost within 20 years’ without protection|last=Aldred|first=Jessica|date=2014-07-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, up to 95 percent of the coral was bleached in some locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Overfishing ===
Jamaica's coral reefs house 135 different species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klomp|first=Kristi|date=2003|title=Condition of Reef Fish on Jamaica's North Coast Signals Late Stages of Over Exploitation|url=http://aquaticcommons.org/13590/1/gcfi_54-49.pdf|journal=54th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute|pages=592–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1998, fishing licenses increased by 68 percent for the Montego Bay Marine Park where 69 percent of fishers rely on fishing as their full-time income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunce|first=L.|last2=Gustavson|first2=K.|last3=Williams|first3=J.|last4=Miller|first4=M.|date=1999-12-01|title=The human side of reef management: a case study analysis of the socioeconomic framework of Montego Bay Marine Park|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380050215|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–380|doi=10.1007/s003380050215|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 on Jamaica's north coast, trap fishermen set 1800 traps which was at least two times above sustainability levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish density dwindled to 9.8 fish per 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Status of Caribbean Coral Reefs after Bleaching and Hurricanes in 2005|last=Jones|first=Loureene|publisher=Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network|year=2008|location=Townsville, Australia|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing has reduced the herbivorous fish that keep algae populations in check and it has caused a phase shift from coral reefs to algae reefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, algae covers 24 percent of the reefs where corals once stood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1960, fish biomass was reduced by 80 percent due to overfishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish that are vital to coral reef survival, such as the Parrot fish, have been driven to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/content/despair-repair-dramatic-decline-caribbean-corals-can-be-reversed|title=From despair to repair: Dramatic decline of Caribbean corals can be reversed|date=2014-06-30|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, overfishing has also been linked to the disappearance of the black sea urchin, ''[[Diadema antillarum]],'' which also helped to reduce microalgal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2009|title=Disaster and Recovery of the Fringing Reefs of North Jamaica|url=|journal=CO2 Science|volume=12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Sewage pollution has led to [[eutrophication]] which results in an abundance of nutrients for microalgal populations to bloom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=B. E.|last2=Thacker|first2=K.|last3=Hanson|first3=C.|last4=Getten|first4=L.|date=2011-07-01|title=Sewage pollution in Negril, Jamaica: effects on nutrition and ecology of coral reef macroalgae|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00343-011-0506-8|journal=Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=775–789|doi=10.1007/s00343-011-0506-8|issn=0254-4059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Environmental Program determined that 85 percent of the sewage entering the Caribbean ocean is untreated.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wear|first=Stephanie L.|last2=Thurber|first2=Rebecca Vega|date=2015-10-01|title=Sewage pollution: mitigation is key for coral reef stewardship|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12785/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1355|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.1111/nyas.12785|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raw sewage contains dissolved inorganic nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals, and toxins that can cause coral bleaching, disease, increased mortality, and decreased coral growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study concluded that increased nutrients such as, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, doubled the probability of coral diseases and tripled the probability of bleaching.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An increase of inorganic nitrogen was also linked to the presence of pathogens which can lead to coral mortality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The heavy metals prevent respiration and nerve communication within the coral which also leads to coral mortality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Hurricanes ===
Major hurricane events include Hurricane Allen in 1980, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and Hurricane Ivan in 2004.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2005, there were a record breaking 26 storms recorded that caused 26 events of bleaching in 16 of Jamaica's coral reef sites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The hurricanes affected 68 percent of Jamaica's coral reefs and 38 percent of those corals later died.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In September 2005, up to 95 percent of Jamaica's corals had bleached, but only 50 percent recovered later.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result of the 2005 hurricane, microalgal blooms took over where the corals once were.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Disease ===
The Caribbean's coral reefs have been increasingly becoming diseased by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Coral diseases can cause tissue damage or it could even destroy the entire colony.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1980, white-band disease killed 95 percent of the ''Acroporid palmata'' and ''Acroporid cervicornis'' colonies which placed them on the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2010 study concluded that sewage runoff in was correlated to the white pox coral disease that destroyed the ''Acroporid palmata'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=Kathryn Patterson|last2=Porter|first2=James W.|last3=Turner|first3=Jeffrey W.|last4=Thomas|first4=Brian J.|last5=Looney|first5=Erin E.|last6=Luna|first6=Trevor P.|last7=Meyers|first7=Meredith K.|last8=Futch|first8=J.

'''Exhibit design''' (or '''exhibition design'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exhibition Design | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | author=Dernie, David | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-393-73211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/xmdxmdma/ MA Design for Exhibition and Museum], [[University of Lincoln]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibit designer]]s (or [[exhibition designer]]s) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit.
There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions.
   
Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[audiovisual]] engineering, [[digital media]], [[lighting designer|lighting]], [[interior design]], and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Skolnick, [[Jan Lorenc]], and Craig Berger, ''What is Exhibition Design?'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with [[graphic designers]], content specialists, [[architects]], fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other [[mission statement|mission]]-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations.
  
The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or [[interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442230170/Museums-101|title=Museums 101|last=Walhimer|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781442230187|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community.

One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience.  By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Falk, ''Identity and the museum visitor experience''2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways. &lt;ref&gt;Nina Simon, ''The Participatory Museum'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6381">[[File:Fizeau interferometer testing optical flat.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1. Fizeau interferometer]]
A '''Fizeau interferometer'''&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Peter R. "Principles of Long Baseline Stellar Interferometry." Course notes from the 1999 Michelson Summer School, held August 15–19, 1999. Edited by Peter R. Lawson. Published by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[interferometry|interferometric]] arrangement whereby two reflecting surfaces are placed facing each other. As seen in Fig&amp;nbsp;1, the rear-surface reflected light from the transparent first reflector is combined with front-surface reflected light from the second reflector to form interference fringes.

The term '''Fizeau interferometer''' also refers to an interferometric arrangement used by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in a famous 1851 experiment that seemingly supported the [[Aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|partial ether-drag hypothesis]] of [[Augustin Jean Fresnel]], but which ultimately played an instrumental role in bringing about a crisis in physics that led to Einstein's development of the theory of [[special relativity]]. See [[Fizeau experiment]].

==Applications==
Fizeau interferometers are commonly used for measuring the shape of an optical surface: Typically, a fabricated lens or mirror is compared to a reference piece having the desired shape. In Fig. 1, the Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an [[optical flat]]. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. A collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminates the two flats, and a beam splitter allows the fringes to be viewed on-axis.&lt;ref name=Guideline&gt;{{cite web|title=Guideline for Use of Fizeau Interferometer in Optical Testing |url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/2404.pdf |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OPIFizeau&gt;{{cite web |title=Interferential devices - Fizeau Interferometer |url=http://www.optique-ingenieur.org/en/courses/OPI_ang_M02_C05/co/Contenu_25.html |publisher=Optique pour l'Ingénieur.|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference piece is sometimes realized by a diffractive optical element (computer-generated hologram or CGH), as this can be manufactured by high accuracy lithographic methods. Fig.&amp;nbsp;2 illustrates the use of CGHs in testing. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes.&lt;ref name=Burge2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burge |first=J.

Fizeau interferometers are also used in [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] sensors for measuring [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], etc.

==Fizeau's ether-drag experiment==
{{Main|Fizeau experiment}}

===Significance===
[[File:Fizeau interferometer.JPG|thumb|300px|Figure 3. Fizeau interferometer for measuring the effect of water movement upon the [[speed of light]].]]
In 1851, Fizeau used an entirely different form of interferometer to measure the effect of movement of a medium upon the speed of light, as seen in Fig.&amp;nbsp;3.

According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged along by the medium, so  the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed ''through'' the medium plus the speed ''of'' the medium.

Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial ether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists.

Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].

===Experimental setup===
Light reflected from the tilted [[beam splitter]] is made parallel using a lens and split by slits into two beams, which traverse a tube carrying water moving with velocity ''v''. Each beam travels a different leg of the tube, is reflected at the mirror at left, and returns through the opposite leg of the tube. Thus, both beams travel the same path, but one in the direction of flow of the water, and the other opposing the flow. The two beams are recombined at the detector, forming an interference pattern that depends upon any difference in time traveling the two paths.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book |title=Physical Optics |author=Robert Williams Wood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ohp5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA514 |page=514 |date=1905 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29302">'''Forensic identification''' is the application of [[forensic science]], or "forensics", and technology to identify specific objects from the [[trace evidence]] they leave, often at a [[crime scene]] or the scene of an accident. Forensic means "for the courts".

==Human identification==
[[File:Blooddroplets.JPG|right|thumb|Droplets of [[human blood]]. In addition to analyzing for [[DNA]], the droplets are round and show no spattering, indicating they impacted at a relatively slow velocity, in this case from a height of two feet.]]

People can be identified by their [[fingerprint]]s. This assertion is supported by the philosophy of [[Dermal papillae|friction ridge]] identification, which states that friction ridge identification is established through the agreement of friction ridge formations, in sequence, having sufficient uniqueness to individualize.

Friction ridge identification is also governed by four premises or statements of facts:
# Friction ridges develop on the fetus in their definitive form prior to birth.
# Friction ridges are persistent throughout life except for permanent scarring, disease, or decomposition after death.
# Friction ridge paths and the details in small areas of friction ridges are unique and never repeated.
# Overall, friction ridge patterns vary within limits which allow for classification.

People can also be identified from traces of their DNA from blood, skin, hair, saliva, and semen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAN DNA DEMAND A VERDICT?{{!}}|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/labs/gel/forensics/|work=Learn Genetics|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[DNA fingerprinting]], from their [[ear print analysis|ear print]], from their teeth or bite by [[forensic odontology]], from a photograph or a video recording by [[facial recognition system]]s, from the video recording of their walk by [[gait analysis]], from an audio recording by [[voice analysis]], from their handwriting by [[Questioned Document Examination|handwriting analysis]], from the content of their writings by their writing style (e.g. typical phrases, factual bias, and/or misspellings of words), or from other traces using other [[biometric]] techniques.

Since forensic identification has been first introduced to the courts in 1980, the first exoneration due to DNA evidence was in 1989 and there have been 336 additional exonerations since then.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/exonerate/|title=Exonerate the Innocent|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=|access-date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who specialize in forensic identification continue to make headway with new discoveries and technological advances to make convictions more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=M.|date=1998|title=The role of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Instrumental techniques in forensic urine drug testing.|url=|journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine|volume=18|issue=4|pages=631–649|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Science Laws Database (2014, August 1).

Retrieved February, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/dna-laws-database.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body identification]] is a subfield of forensics concerned with identifying someone from their remains.

=== Foot creases ===
Feet also have friction ridges like fingerprints do. Friction ridges have been widely accepted as a form of identification with fingerprints but not entirely with feet. Feet have creases which remain over time due to the depth it reaches in the dermal layer of the skin, making them permanent.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=S.

=== Downfalls ===

The two basic conceptual foundations of forensic identification is that everyone is individualized and unique.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=S.A.|date=2009|title=Forensics without uniqueness, conclusions without individualization: the new epistemology of forensic identification.|url=|journal=Law, Probability, and Risk|edition=3|volume=8|pages=233–255|doi=10.1093/lpr/mgp016|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This individualization belief was invented by a police records clerk, [[Alphonse Bertillon]], based on the idea that "nature never repeats," originating from the father of social statistics, [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet]]. The belief was passed down through generations being generally accepted, but it was never scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=M.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Blenkin|first3=M.|date=April 19, 2011|title=Forensic Identification Science Evidence Since Daubert: Part II—Judicial Reasoning in Decisions to Exclude Forensic Identification Evidence on Grounds of Reliability|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|edition=4|volume=56|pages=913–917|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01776.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a study done intending to show that no two fingerprints were the same, but the results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=H.|last2=Mildo|first2=C.|date=1943|title=Finger Prints, Palms and Soles: An Introduction to  Dermatoglyphics|url=|journal=|location=Philadelphia, PA|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern forensic and [[evidentiary]] scholars collectively agree that individualization to one object, such as a fingerprint, bite mark, handwriting, or ear mark is not possible. In court cases, forensic scientists can fall victim to [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] when not sufficiently blinded to the case or results of other pertinent tests. This has happened in cases like ''[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0221p-06.pdf United States v. Green]'' and ''[https://casetext.com/case/state-v-langill-2 State v. Langill]''. Also, the [http://www.forensic-testing.net/proficiency-tests proficiency tests] that forensic analysts must do are often not as demanding to be considered admissible in court.

=== DNA Identification ===
Forensic [[DNA]] analysis can be a useful tool in aiding forensic identification because DNA is found in almost all cells of our bodies except red blood cells. [[Deoxyribonucleic]] acid is located in two different places of the cell, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]; which is inherited from both parents, and the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria]]; inherited maternally. Similar to fingerprints, an individual’s [[DNA profile]] and characteristics are unique. Forensic identification using DNA can be useful in different cases such as determining suspects in violent crimes, solving [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]]/maternity, and identifying human remains of victims from mass disasters or missing person cases. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is also used to link suspects or victims to each other or to crime scenes. When a sample is located at a crime scene, it must be collected, processed, and transported, along with a chain of custody, to the laboratory for analysis, so that if a DNA profile is generated it can be accepted in court. Proper evidence collection and preservation is crucial to ensure evidence is not being contaminated. Main procedures investigators must use when packaging biological material is allowing the evidence to air dry and then package into paper bags. Plastic bags should never be used on biological evidence because it could degrade DNA or lead to bacterial growth. 

DNA can be sourced from [[Organic matter|biological material]] such as semen, blood, saliva, feces, urine, teeth, bone, and hair that is left behind from an individual. There are different [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|presumptive]] and [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|confirmatory]] tests used for each type of biological material found at a scene. Presumptive tests are quick, sensitive and are relatively specific to bodily fluids that give the analyst an idea of what might be present. Confirmatory tests confirm what the biological sample is. In addition to looking for biological material at a crime scene, pieces of evidence can also be examined and analyzed for the presence of DNA. Evidence pieces that may have the presence of DNA could include clothing, bedding, weapons, masks, gloves, among many others. This is attributed to [[touch DNA]], where only minute samples are left after an object has been touched. It is defined as “evidence with no visible staining that would likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the skin to an object.” &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2013/04/touch-dna-crime-scene-crime-laboratory|title=Touch DNA: From the Crime Scene to the Crime Laboratory|date=2013-04-12|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Forensic Scientist|forensic scientist]] can attempt to obtain a DNA profile from the sample with as few as six cells.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

The first step in the DNA process with a piece of evidence is [[DNA extraction|extraction]]. Extraction is a technique used to remove the DNA from the cell. The next step would be quantification which determines how much DNA is present. The third step is [[Amplification of DNA|amplification]] in order to yield multiple copies of DNA. Next is [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|separation]], to separate the DNA out to use for identification. Finally, the analyst can now complete analysis and interpretation of the DNA sample and compare to known profiles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forensicsciencesimplified.org/dna/how.html|title=DNA Evidence: How It’s Done|website=www.forensicsciencesimplified.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unknown sample found at a crime scene is called a questioned sample. A known sample can be taken either from a suspect or found in a [[database]]. The FBI’s database used for DNA is [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]], Combined DNA Index System. It has data at three levels: local, state, and national. The national level data is stored in [[Combined DNA Index System|NDIS]], National DNA Index system. CODIS/NDIS allows analysts to compare their questioned DNA profile among those of arrestees, convicted offenders, and other unknown samples to try and produce investigative leads. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nij.gov/journals/266/Pages/backlogs-codis.aspx|title=What is CODIS? {{!}} National Institute of Justice|website=National Institute of Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; If questioned and known samples are similar, [[statistics]] and interpretation will then be completed. The DNA profile will be compared to a population database and a [[Forensic statistics|random match probability]] will be determined. Random match probability is defined as the chance that an individual selected randomly from a population will have an identical DNA profile to the markers tested. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45406517|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology &amp; technology behind STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall),|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780121479510|location=San Diego|oclc=45406517}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not equal each other, they are not a match, termed exclusion.  

During [[Dna Typing|DNA typing]], several markers are examined, termed [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. When more markers are examined, this could result in either a greater probability that two unrelated individuals will have different [[Genotype|genotypes]] or adds to the confidence of connecting an individual to an unknown sample.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One locus difference between a questioned and known sample is enough to exclude that suspect as the contributor.  

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has identified 13 core STR loci that are effective for human identification. STR is [[short tandem repeats]] which are short DNA regions in the [[genome]] and are 2-6 base pairs in length. STR is common in forensic analysis because they are easily amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and they have unique variation among individuals for human identification. PCR is the technique of copying DNA by making millions of copies. When all 13 core loci are tested on a DNA profile, the random match probability is more than one in a trillion.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

Since DNA was first used in a criminal investigation in 1986, it has aided investigators to solve many cases. DNA profiling is one of the most important tools in forensics and continued research will increase its ability and accuracy to provide more techniques for the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploredna.co.uk/understanding-forensic-identification.html|title=Understanding Forensic Identification|website=www.exploredna.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Animal identification ==

=== Wildlife forensics ===
There are many different applications for wildlife forensics and below are only some of the procedures and processes used to distinguish species.

&lt;u&gt;Species Identification&lt;/u&gt;: The important of species identification is most prominent in animal population that are [[Poaching|illegally hunted]], harvested, and traded,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alacs|first=E. A.|last2=Georges|first2=A.|last3=FitzSimmons|first3=N.

In order to distinguish which species is which, [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]], or mitochondrial DNA, is the most used [[genetic marker]] because it's easier to [[DNA profiling|type]] from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to [[nuclear DNA]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randi|first=E|date=2000|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=A. J.|others=Malden: Blackwell Science|title=Mitochondrial DNA|url=|journal=Molecular methods in ecology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the mitochondrial DNA has multiple copies per cell,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is another reason it's frequently used. When nuclear DNA is used, certain segments of the strands are amplified in order to compare those to segments of mitochondrial DNA. This comparison is used to figure out related genes and species proximity since distant relatives of animals are closer in proximity in the gene tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandamme|first=A|date=2003|editor-last=Salemi M., Vandamme A.|others=New York: Cambridge University Press|title=Basic concepts of molecular evolution|url=|journal=The phylogenetic handbook. A practical approach to DNA and protein phylogeny.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the comparison process demands precision because mistakes can easily be made due to genes evolving and [[Mutation|mutating]] in the evolution of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maddison|first=W.

&lt;u&gt;Determination of geographic origin:&lt;/u&gt; Determining the origin of a certain species aids research in population numbers and [[Data lineage|lineage data]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] studies are most often used to find the broad geographic area of which a species reside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avise|first=J.C.|last2=Arnold|first2=J.|last3=Martin Bal|first3=I.R.|last4=Bermingham|first4=E.|last5=Lamb|first5=T.|last6=Neigel|first6=J.E.|date=1987|title=Intraspecific phylogeography: the mitochondrial DNA bridge between population genetics and systematics.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=18|pages=489–522|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.18.1.489|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California seahorses were being sold for traditional medicinal purposes and the phylogenetic data of those seahorses led researchers to find their origin and from which population they came from and what species they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.G.|last2=Cribbs|first2=J.E.|last3=Fienberg|first3=H.G.|last4=Hulburd|first4=G.C.|last5=Katz|first5=L.S.|last6=Palumbi|first6=S.R.|authorlink6=Stephen R.

=== Domestic animal forensics ===
Domestic animals such as dogs and cats can be utilized to help solve criminal cases. These can include homicides, sexual assaults, or robberies.

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

==Other mentions in the Bible==
[[File:Tissot Moses Destroys the Tables of the Ten Commandments.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moses destroying the tables (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
The golden calf is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|9:16–21|NIV}}.
{{quote|
"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M.

The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"/&gt; Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Islam: Inception to Conclusion|author=Iftikhar Ahmed Mehar|page=123|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O0gypGNaj3kC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9p32T7_iF8j0-gb7wcTaBg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and [[Resurrection|resurrected]] them and they continued on their journey.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

It consists of a reinforced concrete beam that transmits the load from a bearing wall into spaced foundations such as pile caps or caissons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Edward|title=Fundamentals of Building Construction|year=2009|publisher=Fundamentals of Building Construction|location=Hoboken, New Jersey, USA|page=970}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in conditions where the surface soil’s load-bearing capacity is less than the anticipated [[design load]]s.

A grade beam differs from a [[wall footing]] because a grade beam is designed for bending and typically spans between pile caps or caissons, while a wall footing bears on soil and transmits the weight of the wall directly into the ground. It also differs from a [[strap footing|strap beam]] because a grade beam is reinforced to distribute the weight of a wall to separate foundations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Edward|title=Fundamentals of Building Construction|year=2009|publisher=Fundamentals of Building Construction|location=Hoboken, New Jersey, USA|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a strap beam is designed to redistribute the weight of a column between footings.

Grade beams may also be used in conjunction with [[spread footing]]s, in a case with large moments from lateral loads, in order to reduce the size of each spread footing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Greywater treatment.jpg|thumb|Left: Greywater sample from an office building. Right: Same greywater after treatment in [[membrane bioreactor]]]]

'''Greywater''' ([[spelling differences|also spelled]] '''graywater''', '''grey water''' and '''gray water''') or '''sullage''' is all [[wastewater]] generated in households or office buildings from streams without fecal contamination, i.e. all streams except for the wastewater from toilets. Sources of greywater include, [[sinks]], [[shower]]s, [[bathtub|baths]], clothes [[washing machines]] or dish washers. As greywater contains fewer [[pathogen]]s than domestic wastewater, it is generally safer to handle and easier to treat and reuse onsite for [[Flush toilet|toilet flushing]], landscape or crop [[irrigation]], and other non-potable uses.

The application of greywater reuse in [[Integrated urban water management|urban water system]]s provides substantial benefits for both the [[water supply]] subsystem by reducing the demand for fresh [[clean water]] as well as the wastewater subsystems by reducing the amount of wastewater required to be conveyed and treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems|last = Behzadian|first = k|date = 2015|journal = Science of the Total Environment|doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kapelan|first2 = Z|publisher = Elsevier|volume = 527–528|pages = 220–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treated greywater has many uses, for example toilet flushing or irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|title=NM State greywater advice|last=Duttle|first=Marsha|date=January 1990|publisher=[[New Mexico State University]]|accessdate=23 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213002120/http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|archivedate=13 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Greywater - from house cleanings (2946418965).jpg|thumb|Example of a source of greywater in the household: dirty water from cleaning the floor]]
[[File:Greywater treatment garden (3212483147).jpg|thumb|Urban decentralized greywater treatment with [[constructed wetland]] in [[Oslo]]]]
[[File:Greywater treatment plant (5729648031).jpg|thumb|Greywater treatment plant with [[membrane bioreactor]] in the basement of an office building in [[Frankfurt]]]]

===Definition===

Greywater is all [[wastewater]] that is generated in household or office building sources without [[fecal]] contamination. Therefore, by definition, greywater does not include the discharge of toilets or highly fecally contaminated wastewater, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and contains [[human waste]].

=== Quality ===
Greywater usually contains some traces of [[excreta]] and is therefore not free of pathogens.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; The excreta comes from washing a person's anal area in the bath and shower, or from the laundry (washing underwear and nappies). The quality of greywater can deteriorate rapidly during storage because it often is warm and contains some nutrients and organic matter (e.g. dead skin cells), as well as pathogens. Stored greywater also leads to odour nuisances for the same reason.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Quantity ===
In households with conventional flush toilets, greywater makes up about 65% of the total wastewater produced by that household.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; It may be a good source of water for reuse, because there is a close relationship between the production of greywater and the potential demand for toilet flushing water.

===Practical aspects===

Misconnections of pipes can cause greywater tanks to contain a percentage of blackwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolksdorf|first=J.|last2=Cornel|first2=P.|date=2017-05-19|title=Separating grey- and blackwater in urban water cycles – sensible in the view of misconnections?|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|pages=wst2017293|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.293|issn=0273-1223|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194343/http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=|volume=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small traces of [[human feces|feces]] that enter the greywater stream via [[effluent]] from the shower, sink, or washing machine do not pose practical hazards under normal conditions, as long as the greywater is used correctly (for example, percolated from a [[dry well]] or used correctly in farming irrigation).

==Treatment processes==

{{Further|Sewage treatment plant| Reclaimed water}}

The separate treatment of greywater falls under the concept of [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] which is one principle commonly applied in [[ecological sanitation]] approaches. The main advantage of keeping greywater separate from toilet wastewater is that the pathogen load is much reduced and the greywater is therefore easier to treat and reuse.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-3-906484-57-0 |url=http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |last1=Tilley |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ulrich |first2=Lukas |last3=Lüthi |first3=Christoph |last4=Reymond |first4=Philippe |last5=Zurbrügg |first5=Chris |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132303024500/http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |archivedate=2017-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When greywater is mixed with toilet wastewater, it is called sewage or [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and should be treated in [[sewage treatment]] plants or onsite sewage facility, which often is a septic system. When it is kept separate, it may open up interesting decentralized treatment and reuse options.

Greywater from kitchen sinks contains [[fat]]s, [[oil]]s and [[Yellow grease|grease]] and high loads of organic matter. It should undergo preliminary treatment to remove these substances before discharge into a grey water tank. If this is difficult to apply, it could be directed to the blackwater system or to an existing [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/~/media/Publications/891%204.pdf |title=Code of practice – on-site wastewater management, EPA-Victoria, Au, Publication 891 4-1|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most greywater is easier to treat and recycle than blackwater (sewage), because of lower levels of contaminants. If collected using a separate plumbing system from blackwater, domestic greywater can be [[water recycling|recycled]] directly within the home, garden or company and used either immediately or processed and stored. If stored, it must be used within a very short time or it will begin to putrefy due to the organic solids in the water. Recycled greywater of this kind is never [[potable|safe to drink]], but a number of treatment steps can be used to provide water for washing or flushing toilets.

The treatment processes that can be used are in principle the same as those used for sewage treatment, except that they are usually installed on a smaller scale (decentralized level), often at household or building level:
* Biological systems such as [[constructed wetland]]s or [[green wall|living walls]] and bioreactors or more compact systems such as [[membrane bioreactor]]s which are a variation of the [[activated sludge]] process and is also used to treat sewage.
* Mechanical systems ([[sand filter|sand filtration]], [[lava filter|lava filter systems]] and systems based on [[UV]] radiation)
In constructed wetlands, the plants use contaminants of greywater, such as food particles, as nutrients in their growth. However, salt and soap residues can be toxic to microbial and plant life alike, but can be absorbed and degraded through [[constructed wetlands]] and aquatic plants such as [[sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], and grasses.

==Reuse==
{{Further|Resource recovery|Integrated urban water management}}
The global water resources are worsening. According to a report from United Nations states that 2.7 billion people will face the problem of water shortage by 2025, which means almost 1/2-1/3 of the total population of the world will be affected by this problem. Reusing the [[wastewater]] has become a good way to solve this problem, and wastewater reuse is also called recycled or [[reclaimed water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Juan |first=Yi-Kai|last2=Chen|first2=Yi|last3=Lin|first3=Jing-Ming|date=19 November 2016|title=Greywater Reuse System Design and Economic Analysis for Residential Buildings in Taiwan|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/546/htm|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Demand on conventional water supplies and pressure on sewage treatment systems is reduced by the use of greywater. Re-using greywater also reduces the volume of sewage effluent entering watercourses which can be ecologically beneficial. In times of drought, especially in urban areas, greywater use in gardens or toilet systems helps to achieve some of the goals of [[ecologically sustainable development]].

The potential ecological benefits of greywater recycling include

* Reduced freshwater extraction from rivers and [[aquifers]]
* Less impact from [[septic tank]] and [[water treatment plant|treatment plant]] infrastructure
* Reduced energy use and chemical pollution from treatment
* [[Groundwater recharge]]
* Reclamation of nutrients
* Greater quality of [[surface water|surface]] and [[ground water]] when preserved by the natural purification in the top layers of soil than generated water treatment processes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html Lets Go Green Practical Alternatives to Sewer and Septic Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130042458/http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. Southwest]] and the Middle East where available water supplies are limited, especially in view of a rapidly growing population, a strong imperative exists for adoption of alternative water technologies.

The potential economic benefits of greywater recycling include

* Can reduce the demand for [[fresh water]], and when people reduce the use of fresh water, the cost of domestic water consumption is significantly reduced, while alleviating the pressure of global water resources.
* Can reduce the amount of wastewater entering the sewer or on-site treatment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainable.com.au/greywater-treatment.html|title=Sustainable Earth Technologies|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
Greywater use for irrigation appears to be a safe practice. A 2015 epidemiological study found no additional burden of disease among greywater users irrigating arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;Busgang A, Friedler E, Ovadia O, Gross A. Epidemiological study for the assessment of health risks associated with greywater reuse for irrigation in arid regions. Science of the Total Environment [serial online]. December 25, 2015;538:230-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of reuse of greywater as potable water has also been studied. A few organic micropollutants including benzene were found in greywater in significant concentrations but most pollutants were in very low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Etchepare R, van der Hoek J. Health risk assessment of organic micropollutants in greywater for potable reuse. Water Research [serial online]. April 2015;72:186-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Faecal contamination, peripheral pathogens (e.g., skin and mucous tissue), and food-derived pathogens are the three major sources of pathogens in greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maimon|first=Adi|last2=Friedler|first2=Eran|last3=Gross|first3=Amit|date=27 March 2014|title=Parameters affecting greywater quality and its safety for reuse|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714004859?via%3Dihub|access-date=28 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.133|volume=487|journal=Science of the Total Environment|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greywater reuse in toilet flushing and garden irrigation may produce [[aerosol]]s. These could transmit [[Legionella|legionella disease]] and bring a potential health risk for people. However, the result of the research shows that the health risk due to reuse of greywater either for garden irrigation or toilet flushing was not significantly higher than the risk associated with using clear water for the same activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanky|first=Marina|last2=Sharaby|first2=Yehonatan|last3=et al.|date=14 June 2017|title=Greywater reuse - Assessment of the health risk induced by Legionella pneumophila|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135417307212?via%3Dihub#sec3|access-date=28 November 2017|work=Sustainable Earth Technologies|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.068|volume=125|pages=410–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrigation===
Most greywater should be assumed to have some blackwater-type components, including [[pathogens]]. Greywater should be applied below the surface where possible (e.g., via drip line on top of the soil, under [[mulch]]; or in mulch-filled trenches) and not sprayed, as there is a danger of inhaling the water as an [[aerosol]].

In any greywater system, it is important to avoid toxic materials such as bleaches, [[bath salts]], artificial dyes, [[chlorine]]-based cleansers, strong [[acids]]/[[alkali]], [[solvents]], and products containing [[boron]], which is toxic to plants at high levels. Most cleaning agents contain [[sodium]] [[salts]], which can cause excessive soil [[alkalinity]], inhibit seed germination, and destroy the structure of soils by dispersing clay. Soils watered with greywater systems can be amended with [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]) to reduce [[pH]]. Cleaning products containing [[ammonia]] are safe to use, as plants can use it to obtain nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.umass.edu/landscape/fact-sheets/recycling-gray-water-home-gardens|title=Recycling Gray Water for Home Gardens|publisher=University of Massachusetts|author1=Dr. Allen V.

Some greywater may be applied directly from the sink to the garden or container field, receiving further treatment from [[soil microbes|soil life]] and plant roots.

The use of non-toxic and low-sodium soap and personal care products is recommended to protect vegetation when reusing greywater for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA.

Retrieved: 21 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor reuse===
Recycled greywater from showers and bathtubs can be used for flushing toilets in most European and Australian jurisdictions and in United States jurisdictions that have adopted the [[International Plumbing Code]].

Such a system could provide an estimated 30% reduction in water use for the average household. The danger of [[biological contamination]] is avoided by using:
* A cleaning tank, to eliminate floating and sinking items
* An intelligent control mechanism that flushes the collected water if it has been stored long enough to be hazardous; this completely avoids the problems of filtration and chemical treatment

Greywater recycling without treatment is used in certain [[dwellings]] for applications where potable water is not required (e.g., garden and land irrigation, [[toilet flushing]]). It may also be used in dwellings when the greywater (e.g., from [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater]]) is already fairly clean to begin with and/or has not been polluted with non-degradable chemicals such as non-natural soaps (thus using natural cleaning products instead). It is not recommended to use water that has been in the greywater filtration system for more than 24 hours as bacteria builds up, affecting the water that is being reused.

Due to the limited treatment technology, the treated greywater still contains some chemicals and bacteria, so some safety issues should be observed when using the treated greywater around the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/water/saving-water/articles/guide-to-greywater-systems| title=choice|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat reclamation===
Devices are currently available that capture heat from residential and industrial greywater, through a process called drainwater heat recovery, greywater heat recovery, or hot [[water heat recycling]].

Rather than flowing directly into a water heating device, incoming cold water flows first through a heat exchanger where it is pre-warmed by heat from greywater flowing out from such activities as dishwashing, or showering. Typical household devices receiving greywater from a shower can recover up to 60% of the heat that would otherwise go to waste.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Regulations==
=== United States ===
[[Government regulation]] governing domestic greywater use for landscape irrigation (diversion for reuse) is still a developing area and continues to gain wider support as the actual risks and benefits are considered and put into clearer perspective.

"Greywater" (by pure legal definition) is considered in some jurisdictions to be "sewage" (all wastewater including greywater and toilet waste), but in the U.S. states that adopt the ''International Plumbing Code'', it can be used for subsurface irrigation and for toilet flushing, and in states that adopt the ''[[Uniform Plumbing Code]]'', it can be used in underground disposal fields that are akin to shallow sewage disposal fields.

[[Wyoming]] allows surface and subsurface irrigation and other non-specific use of greywater under a Department of Environmental Quality policy enacted in March 2010. [[California]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]] and some other states allow true subsurface [[drip irrigation]] with greywater. Where greywater is still considered sewage, it is bound by the same regulatory procedures enacted to ensure properly engineered septic tank and effluent disposal systems are installed for long system life and to control spread of disease and pollution. In such regulatory jurisdictions, this has commonly meant domestic greywater diversion for landscape irrigation was either not permitted or was discouraged by expensive and complex sewage system approval requirements. Wider legitimate community greywater diversion for landscape irrigation has subsequently been handicapped and resulted in greywater reuse continuing to still be widely undertaken by householders outside of and in preference to the legal avenues.

However, with [[water conservation]] becoming a necessity in a growing number of jurisdictions, business, political and community pressure has made regulators seriously reconsider the actual risks against actual benefits.

It is now recognized and accepted by an increasing number of regulators{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that the microbiological risks of greywater reuse at the single dwelling level where inhabitants already had intimate knowledge of that greywater are in reality an insignificant risk, when properly managed without the need for onerous approval processes. This is reflected in the [[New South Wales]] Government Department of Water and Energy's newly released greywater diversion rules, and the recent passage of greywater legislation in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="montanalaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106092106/http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }} 2007 greywater legislation in Montana&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 Legislative Session, the state of Montana passed a bill expanding greywater use into multi-family and commercial buildings. The Department of Environmental Quality has already drafted rules and design guidelines for greywater re-use systems in all these applications. Existing staff would review systems proposed for new subdivisions in conjunction with review of all other wastewater system components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gray water law is a good step forward |newspaper= [[The Montana Standard]] |date= 2009-04-01 |url= http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160407021503/http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |archivedate= 2016-04-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict permit requirements in [[Austin, Texas]], led to issuance of only one residential graywater permit since 2010. A working group formed to streamline the permitting process, and in 2013, the city created new code that has eased the requirements, resulting in four more permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144253/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }} Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, a push has been made in recent years to address greywater in connection with the State's greenhouse gas reduction goals (see [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|AB 32]]). As a large amount of energy (electricity) is used for pumping, treating and transporting potable water within the state, water conservation has been identified as one of several ways California is seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;California Air Resources Board. AB 32 Scoping Plan. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the [[California Building Standards Commission]] (CBSC) approved the addition of Chapter 16A "Non-potable Water Reuse Systems" to the 2007 California Plumbing Code. Emergency regulations allowing greywater reuse systems were subsequently filed with the [[California Secretary of State]] August 2009 and became effective immediately upon filing. Assembly Bill 371 (Goldberg 2006) and Senate Bill 283 (DeSaulnier 2009) directed the [[California Department of Water Resources]] (DWR), in consultation with the State Department of Health Services, to adopt and submit to the CBSC regulations for a State version of Appendix J (renamed Chapter 16 Part 2) of the Uniform Plumbing Code to provide design standards to safely plumb buildings with both potable and recycled water systems. November 2009 the CBSC unanimously voted to approve the California Dual Plumbing Code that establishes statewide standards for potable and recycled water plumbing systems in commercial, retail and office buildings, theaters, auditoriums, condominiums, schools, hotels, apartments, barracks, dormitories, jails, prisons and reformatories. In addition, the [[California Department of Housing and Community Development]] has greywater standards and DWR has also proposed dual plumbing design standards.

In Arizona, greywater is defined as water with a BOD5 less than 380&amp;nbsp;mg/L, TSS&lt;430 and the Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) content should be less than 75&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The Arizona water has issued advice that people should avoid direct contact with grey water. Most greywater use is by underground [[drip irrigation]] since surface irrigation is not permitted.There are three types of use in Arizona: up to a quota of 400 gpd per family (close to 1500 L per day) no permission is required for greywater use, between 400 and 3000 gpd (1500 and 11,355 L per day, respectively) permission is required and above 3000 gpd (&gt;11,355 L per day) it is considered as conventional wastewater venture. 
Other limitations include restrictions on contact, restrictions on use on herbaceous food plants, exclusion of hazardous materials and effective separation from surface water run-off.

The Uniform Plumbing Code, adopted in some U.S. jurisdictions, prohibits greywater use indoors.

=== United Kingdom ===
Greywater recycling is relatively uncommon in the UK, largely because the financial cost and environmental impact of mains water is very low.

Greywater from single sewered premises has the potential to be reused on site for ornamental, garden and lawn irrigation, toilet flushing. The reuse options include Horizontal flow reed bed (HFRB), Vertical flow reed bed (VFRB), Green roof water recycling system (GROW), Membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Membrane chemical reactor (MCR).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oron|first=Gideon|last2=Adel|first2=Mike|last3=Agmon|first3=Vered| last4=Frieder|first4=Eran|last5=Halperin|first5=Rami|last6=Leshem|first6=Ehud| last7=Weinberg|first7=Daniel|date= 14 March 2014|title= Greywater use in Israel and worldwide: Standards and prospects|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541400222X?via%3Dihub|access-date=30 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2014.03.032|volume=58|journal=Water Research|pages=92–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Although Canada is a water-rich country, the center of the country freezes in the winter and droughts happen some summers. There are locations where watering outdoors is restricted in the dry season, some water must be transported from an outside source, or on-site costs are high. At present, the standards for greywater reuse are not strict compared with other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The National Plumbing Code, which is adopted in whole or in part by the provinces, indicates that non-potable water systems should only be used to supply toilets and underground irrigation systems, collecting rainwater with roof gutters is included as a form of greywater.&lt;ref&gt;https://tapsbath.com/wp-content/uploads/Guide-Sustainable-Plumbing-CMHC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Health Canada has published a guideline to use greywater for toilet flushing and British Columbia's building code includes subsurface irrigation with greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/water-quality/household-reclaimed-water-water-quality.html|title=Household Reclaimed Water - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|website=www.canada.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/waste-management/sewage/onsite-sewerage-systems/what_is_grey_water.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta "wastewater from any source cannot be used inside buildings"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/1176|title=Municipal Affairs: Reclaimed Wastewater|first=Jessica|last=Spratt|website=www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saskatchewan also treats greywater as sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowma.ca/home-owners/faqs/|title=FAQs –  Saskatchewan Onsite Wastewater Management Association|website=www.sowma.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Household greywater from a single contaminated site may be reused on-site at the ornamental garden and lawn watering, toilet flushing and laundry uses, depending on the type of greywater and treatment level. Some people wisely re-use the gross weight, but others use it even worse (without any treatment), such as bathing in the bath or simply transferring laundry water to the lawn where children and pets may be exposed directly. The Department of Health and Community Services (DHCS) focuses on protecting public health and then takes action to control and minimize the public health risks associated with greywater reuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cyprus ===
The government of Cyprus has implemented four water-saving subsidies: drilling installations, drilling with lavatories, installation of hot water circulation systems and installation of greywater recycling systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jordan ===
The emphasis on the use of greywater in [[Jordan]] has two main purposes: water conservation and socio-economic aspects. The Amman Islamic Water Development and Management Network (INWRDAM) in Jordan promoted research on gray water reuse in Jordan. At present, greywater research in Jordan is funded mainly by the International Development Research Center (IDRC) in Ottawa, Canada, to install and use greywater systems based on the establishment of small wetland systems in private households. The cost of this system is about 500 US dollars per household.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''history monoid''' is a way of representing the histories of concurrently running computer [[process (computer science)|processes]] as a collection of [[string (computer science)|strings]], each string representing the individual history of a process. The history [[monoid]] provides a set of [[synchronization primitive]]s (such as [[lock (computer science)|locks]], [[mutex]]es or [[thread join]]s) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or [[thread (computing)|threads]].

History monoids occur in the theory of [[concurrent computation]], and provide a low-level mathematical foundation for [[process calculi]], such as CSP the language of [[communicating sequential processes]], or CCS, the [[calculus of communicating systems]]. History monoids were first presented by M.W. Shields.&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Shields "Concurrent Machines", ''Computer Journal'', (1985) '''28''' pp.&amp;nbsp;449–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

History monoids are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[trace monoid]]s (free partially commutative monoids) and to the [[monoid]] of [[dependency graph]]s. As such, they are [[free object]]s and are [[universal property|universal]]. The history monoid is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.

==Product monoids and projection==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;A=(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt;

denote an ''n''-tuple of [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote all possible combinations of finite-length strings from the alphabets:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A)=\Sigma_1^* \times \Sigma_2^* \times \cdots \times \Sigma_n^*&lt;/math&gt;

(In more formal language, &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[free monoid]]s of the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. The superscript star is the [[Kleene star]].) Composition in the product monoid is component-wise, so that, for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{uv}=(u_1v_1,u_2v_2,\ldots,u_nv_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Define the union alphabet to be

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2 \cup \cdots \cup \Sigma_n. \,&lt;/math&gt;

(The union here is the [[set union]], not the [[disjoint union]].) Given any string &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, we can pick out just the letters in some &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt; using the corresponding [[string projection]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_k:\Sigma^*\to\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt;. A '''distribution''' &lt;math&gt;\pi:\Sigma^*\to P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the mapping that operates on &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; with all of the &lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt;, separating it into components in each free monoid:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(w)\mapsto (\pi_1(w), \pi_2(w), \ldots , \pi_n(w)). \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Histories==
For every &lt;math&gt;a\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the tuple &lt;math&gt;\pi(a)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''elementary history''' of ''a''. It serves as an [[indicator function]] for the inclusion of a letter ''a'' in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(a)=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\begin{cases} 
a \mbox{ if } a\in \Sigma_k \\
\varepsilon \mbox { otherwise }.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]].  The '''history monoid''' &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the submonoid of the product monoid &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; generated by the elementary histories: &lt;math&gt;H(A) = \{ \pi(a) | a\in\Sigma \}^*&lt;/math&gt; (where the superscript star is the Kleene star applied with a component-wise definition of composition as given above). The elements of  &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''global histories''', and the projections of a global history are called '''individual histories'''.

==Connection to computer science==
The use of the word ''history'' in this context, and the connection to concurrent computing, can be understood as follows. An individual history is a record of the sequence of [[state (computer science)|states]] of a process (or [[thread (computer science)|thread]] or [[Turing machine|machine]]); the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is the set of states of the process.

A letter that occurs in two or more alphabets serves as a [[synchronization primitive]] between the various individual histories. That is, if such a letter occurs in one individual history, it must also occur in another history, and serves to "tie" or "rendezvous" them together.

Consider, for example, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1=\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2=\{a,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The union alphabet is of course &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{a,b,c,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The elementary histories are &lt;math&gt;(a,a)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(b,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(c,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,d)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,e)&lt;/math&gt;.  In this example, an individual history of the first process might be &lt;math&gt;bcbcc&lt;/math&gt; while the individual history of the second machine might be &lt;math&gt;ddded&lt;/math&gt;. Both of these individual histories are represented by the global history &lt;math&gt;bcbdddcced&lt;/math&gt;, since the projection of this string onto the individual alphabets yields the individual histories. In the global history, the letter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to commute with the letters &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, in that these can be rearranged without changing the individual histories. Such commutation is simply a statement that the first and second processes are running concurrently, and are unordered with respect to each other; they have not (yet) exchanged any messages or performed any synchronization.

The letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; serves as a synchronization primitive, as its occurrence marks a spot in both the global and individual histories, that cannot be commuted across. Thus, while the letters &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; can be re-ordered past &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, they cannot be reordered past &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the global history &lt;math&gt;bcdabe&lt;/math&gt; and the global history &lt;math&gt;bdcaeb&lt;/math&gt; both have as individual histories &lt;math&gt;bcab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dae&lt;/math&gt;, indicating that the execution of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may happen before or after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. However, the letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is synchronizing, so that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to happen after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, even though &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is in a different [[process (computer science)|process]] than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
The history monoid is isomorphic to the [[trace monoid]], and as such, is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.  In particular, the history monoid &lt;math&gt;H(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the trace monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}(D)&lt;/math&gt; with the [[dependency relation]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;D=\left(\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_1\right)\cup
\left(\Sigma_2\times\Sigma_2\right)\cup \cdots \cup
\left(\Sigma_n\times\Sigma_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In simple terms, this is just the formal statement of the informal discussion given above: the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; can be commutatively re-ordered past the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_j&lt;/math&gt;, unless they are letters that occur in both alphabets. Thus, traces are exactly global histories, and vice versa.

'''Buddhist art''' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world. Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].

A common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]]. From a viewer's perspective, it represents schematically the ideal universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blume|first1=Nancy|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://asiasociety.org/exploring-mandala|website=Asia Society|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Cristian|title=Mandala|url=https://www.ancient.eu/mandala/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction. Its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] saw the mandala as ''"a representation of the center of the unconscious self,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm Carl Jung and the Mandala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024061549/http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }} Retrieved January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.&lt;ref&gt;See C G Jung: ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp.186–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutanese art==
{{Main article|Bhutanese art}}
[[File:Bhutanese thanka of Mt. Meru and the Buddhist Universe.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhutanese [[thanka]] of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt. Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]

'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive “spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the ‘[[Folk Heritage Museum]]’ in Thimphu. There is also a ‘Voluntary Artists Studio’ in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=June 7, 2010|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian art==
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|thumb|right|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]] ([[Angkor]])]]
{{Main article|Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture}}
'''Cambodian art''' and the culture of [[Cambodia]] has had a rich and varied history dating back many centuries and has been heavily influenced by [[India]]. In turn, Cambodia greatly influenced [[Thailand]], Laos and vice versa. Throughout Cambodia's long history, a major source of inspiration was from religion. Throughout nearly two millennium, a Cambodians developed a unique [[Khmer people|Khmer]] belief from the syncreticism of indigenous [[animistic]] beliefs and the Indian religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Indian culture and civilization, including its language and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century CE. It is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the gulf of Thailand and the Pacific while trading with China. The first state to benefit from this was [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]. At various times, Cambodia culture also absorbed elements from [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] cultures.

===Visual arts of Cambodia===
[[File:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|thumb|left|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Cambodia|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE]]

The history of [[Visual arts of Cambodia]] stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the [[Angkor]] period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Pottery|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.

By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power. The artists who sculpted the stones doubtless satisfied the primary objectives and requisites demanded by the persons who commissioned them. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeed in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

'''Chinese art''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) has varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology. Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (詞) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (趙孟頫) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].

{{Main article|Indian art|Indian painting|Rangoli}}
'''Indian art''' can be classified into specific periods, each reflecting certain religious, political and cultural developments. The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&amp;nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. 

The art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].

The contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. 

During the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].

One of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.

The visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Insight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.

Specific periods: 	

*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] – present)
 	
*Islamic ascendancy (712–1757 [[Common Era|CE]])

*The colonial period (1757–1947)

*Modern and Postmodern art in India 

*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)

'''Indonesian art''' and culture has been shaped by long [[interaction]] between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. [[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.

[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]
Other exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.

Indonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.

[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760–830&amp;nbsp;AD]]
Most notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.

Calligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.

===Balinese art===
{{Main article|Balinese art}}
[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]
'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings. Covarrubias&lt;ref name="Covarubias"&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes Balinese art as, "... a highly developed, although informal Baroque folk art that combines the peasant liveliness with the refinement of classicism of Hinduistic Java, but free of the conservative prejudice and with a new vitality fired by the exuberance of the demonic spirit of the tropical primitive". Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''&lt;ref name="Eiseman"&gt;

In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.

This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.&lt;ref name="Geertz-Images_of_Power"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.

==Japanese art==

[[File:Birds and flowers of the four seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=3|left|Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground.]]

'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.

The art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''
[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.

The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC – 300&amp;nbsp;AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300–700&amp;nbsp;AD).

Ancient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal—especially [[bronze]]—and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture – except for miniaturized works – had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.

''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning "floating world", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term "Sorrowful World" (憂き世), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.

==Korean art==
[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (금강전도, 金剛全圖), Korea, c.1734]]

{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}
'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.

While there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.

The study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]’s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea’s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''

Generally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].

'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated "While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laotian art==
{{Main article|Lao art}}
[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]
'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].

Lao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.

==Nepalese art==
{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}
The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

==Thai art==
{{Main article|Thai art}}
[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]
'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.

The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; 
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;
*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;
*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;
*[[human head|head]] like an egg;
*Hair like scorpion stingers;
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.

==Tibetan art==
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]
{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}

'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].

As [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.

Tibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]
A visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.

Historians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

==Vietnamese art==

{{Main article|Vietnamese art}}
'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.
[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tô Ngọc Vân, ''Thiếu nữ bên hoa huệ (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]
[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.



The Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.

The [[Nguyễn dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802–1945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn dynasty.

Beginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History – A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt;

Modern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.

===Vietnamese calligraphy===
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Quốc Ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.

[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[José Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.

Kutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''IP over [[DWDM]]''' ('''IPoDWDM''') is a technology used in [[telecommunications networks]] to integrate IP [[Router (computing)|Routers]] and Switches in the OTN ([[Optical Transport Network]]).
A true IPoDWDM solution is implemented only when the IP Routers and  Switches  support ITU-T G.709.&lt;ref name=G709&gt;“Interfaces for Optical Transport Network (OTN)”, ITU-T G.709/Y.1331&lt;/ref&gt; In this way IP devices can monitor the optical path and implement the transport functionality as FEC ([[Forward Error Correction]]) specified by [[ITU-T]] [[G.709/Y.1331]]&lt;ref name=G709/&gt; or [[Super FEC]] functionality defined in ITU-T G.975.1.&lt;ref&gt;“Forward error correction for high bit-rate DWDM submarine systems”, ITU-T G.975.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
This approach saves network components including shelves, processors, interfaces cards and hence it permits to reduce the power consumption, OPEX ([[Operational expenditure]]) and CAPEX  ([[capital expenditure]]).
This approach brings also a simplification of the network, eliminating the [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]/[[SONET]] intermediate layer.&lt;ref&gt;Virgilio Puglia, Olga Zadedyurina, [http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/29/02/T29020000090053PDFE.pdf “optical transport networks: from all-optical to digital”], IEEE,31/08/2009 {{ISBN|978-92-61-12891-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivendors==
A DWDM network can be implemented using different vendor technology from the IP devices as long as they support [[alien wavelength]] transmission specified by ITU-T G.698.2.&lt;ref&gt;D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7526">The '''Indices of deprivation 2004''' ('''ID 2004''') is a [[deprivation index]] at the small [[area]] level, created by the British [[Department for Communities and Local Government]](DCLG).

It is unusual in its inclusion of a measure of geographical access as an element of deprivation and in its direct measure of [[poverty]] (through data on benefit receipts). The ID 2004 is based on the idea of distinct dimensions of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These are then combined into a single overall measure. The Index is made up of seven distinct dimensions of deprivation called Domain Indices. Whilst it is known as the ID2004, most of the data actually dates from 2001.

==History==
Communities and Local Government (previously the Office of Deputy Prime Minister) commissioned the Social Disadvantage Research Centre (SDRC) at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Oxford to update the Indices of  deprivation 2004 (ID 2004) for England. Following an extensive public consultation (see Annex A), an independent academic peer review and a significant programme of work, the new Indices of Deprivation 2007 were produced in December 2007.

The new Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 (IMD 2007) is a Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level measure of multiple deprivation, and is made up of seven LSOA level domain indices. There are also two supplementary indices (Income Deprivation Affecting Children and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People). Summary measures of the IMD 2007 are presented at local authority district level and county council level. The LSOA level Domain Indices and IMD 2007, together with the local authority district and county summaries are referred to as the Indices of Deprivation 2007 (ID 2007).(Rusty 2009)

The ID 2007 are based on the approach, structure and methodology that were used to create the previous ID 2004. The ID 2007 updates the ID 2004 using more up-to-date data. The new IMD 2007 contains seven domains which relate to income deprivation, employment deprivation, health deprivation and disability, education skills and training deprivation, barriers to housing and services, living environment deprivation, and crime.

==Domain Indices==

*'''Income'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to capture the proportions of the population experiencing income deprivation in an area. 
*'''Employment'''

:This Domain measures employment deprivation by considering people of working age who are involuntarily excluded from the world of work, either through unemployment. ill health or family circumstances. 

*'''Health and disability'''

:This Domain identifies areas with relatively high rates of people who die prematurely or whose quality of life is impaired by poor health or who are disabled, across the whole population. 

*'''Education, skills and training'''

:The purpose of the Domain is to capture the extent of deprivation in education, skills and training in a local area. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: one relating to lack of attainment among children and young people and one relating to lack of qualifications in terms of skills. These two sub-domains are designed to reflect the ‘flow’ and ‘stock’ of educational disadvantage within an area respectively. That is, the children/young people sub-domain measures the deprivation in the attaining of qualifications, while the skills sub-domain measures the deprivation in the resident working age adult population. 

*'''Barriers to Housing and Services'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to measure barriers to housing and key local services. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: ‘geographical barriers’ and ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability. 

*'''Living environment'''

:This Domain focuses on deprivation in the living environment. It comprises two sub-domains: the ‘indoors’ living environment which measures the quality of housing and the ‘outdoors’ living environment which contains two measures about air quality and road traffic accidents. 

*'''Crime'''

:This Domain measures the rate of recorded crime for four major crime themes – burglary, theft, criminal damage and violence - representing the occurrence of personal and material victimisation at a small area level.

Each Domain contains a number of indicators, totalling 37. Two supplementary indexes have been created as a subset of the Income domain. These relate to income deprivation affecting children and income deprivation affecting older people.

==Geography==

The Indices of deprivation 2004 are measured at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level. [[Super Output Areas]] were developed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]] Output Areas. There are two levels, the lowest (which the Index is based upon) being smaller than wards and containing a minimum of 1,000 people and 400 households. The middle layer contains a minimum of 5,000 people and 2,000 households. Earlier proposals to introduce Upper Layer Super Output Areas were dropped due to lack of demand. 

In addition to Super Output Areas, Summaries of the ID 2004 are presented at District level, County level and Primary Care Trust (PCT) level.

While each SOA is of higher resolution than the highest resolution ''ward'' index data of the IMD2000 and therefore better at identifying "pockets" of deprivation within wards the 2004 system has its problems. Some areas of deprivation can still be hidden because of the size of SOAs. Examples of this can be found by comparing central areas of [[Keighley]] using the Bradford District Deprivation Index (a [[Deprivation index]] developed by [[City of Bradford|Bradford Council]] produced at 1991 Census [[Enumeration District]] level) with the ID2004.
Additionally SOAs were tasked with providing complete coverage of England and Wales - this combined with the minimum population and household counts within each SOA means that large areas of agricultural, commercial and industrial land have to be included within a residential area that borders them - thus when some very deprived residential areas are mapped, a large area of supposed deprivation emerges, however most of it may not be so but rather has a wide area of relative affluence around it - these can appear to be a greater problem than many smaller completely residential SOAs in which higher concentrations of deprived people live but mixed with more affluent neighbours.

[[File:Abdul Qadir al-Rassam - Title Unknown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Abdul Qadir Al Rassam]], 1901]]

'''Iraqi art''', throughout its entire history, has been influenced by war, revolutions and frequent political changes. For centuries, the capital, Baghdad was the Medieval centre of the literary and artistic Arab world, but its artistic traditions suffered at the hands of the Mongol invaders in the 13th century. During other periods it has flourished, such as during the reign of [[Pir Budaq]], or under Ottoman rule in the 16th century when Baghdad was known for its [[Ottoman miniature]] painting. During the rule of the [[Safavids]], Iraqi art was influenced by [[Persian art]], and it became a centre of poetry as well as arts. In the 20th century, an art revival, which combined both tradition and modern techniques, produced many notable poets, painters and sculptors who contributed to the inventory of public artworks, especially in Baghdad. These artists are highly regarded in the Middle East, and some have earned international recognition. The Iraqi modern art movement had a profound influence on pan-Arab art generally.

==History==
[[File:Yahyâ ibn Mahmûd al-Wâsitî 005.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the manuscript of ''Maqâmât'' written by al-Harîrî'', illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], c. 13th century]]
The art historian, Nada Shabout, points out that Iraqi art remains largely undocumented. The West has very little idea about Iraqi art. Problems associated with documenting a complete picture of Iraqi art have been compounded by the fact that many 20th-century artists, art historians and philosophers have been forced into exile, where they are isolated from their heritage and current practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, p. 94: it may be worth noting that the Ministry of Culture estimates that 80 percent of Iraqi artists are now living in exile, See: ''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, much of Iraq's art heritage has been looted or destroyed during periods of revolution, war and political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, pp 105-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq's art has a deep heritage that extends back in time to ancient [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian art]]. Iraq has one of the longest written traditions in the world. [[Arabic maqam|Maqam]] traditions in music and calligraphy have survived into the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuity of Iraq's arts culture has been subject to the vicissitudes of invading armies for centuries. The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the 13th-century devastated much traditional art and craft and is generally seen as a break in the tradition of Iraqi art.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B., "The Iraqi Century of Art," ''Artnet Magazine'', July 2008, Online: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/davis/davis7-14-08.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although British archaeologists excavated a number of Iraqi sites, including [[Nimrud]], [[Ninevah]] and [[Tell Halaf]] in Iraq in the 19th-century,&lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; they sent many of the artefacts and statues to museums around the world. It was not until the early 20th-century when a small group of Iraqi artists were awarded scholarships to study abroad that they became aware of ancient [[Sumerian art]] by visiting pretigious museums such as the [[Louvre]], enabling them to reconnect with their cultural and intellectual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, figurines, dating to the [[Neolithic]] period, found at the Palace of [[Tell Halaf]] and elsewhere, attest to Iraq's ancient artistic heritage.

The [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] ruled the region that is now Iraq and Iran between the 3rd and 7th centuries. [[Sasanian art]] is best represented in metalwork, jewellery, architecture and wall-reliefs. Few paintings from this period have survived, but an understanding of jewellery ornamentation can be inferred from pictorial and sculptural representations.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  pp 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the early Islamic period, writing was transformed into an "iconophoric message...a carrier of meaning independent of its form [and] into a subject worthy of the most elaborate ornamentation." &lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Another development during this period was the use of repeating patterns or motifs on scrolls and wall-reliefs. Inherited from the Muslims, this highly stylised system of ornamentation was subsequently given the label of ''[[arabesque]]''.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"/&gt;

The [[Abassid]] Dynasty controlled much of the region now encompassed by Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria, between the 8th and 13th-centuries. During the Abassid period, pottery achieved a high level of sophistication, calligraphy began to be used to decorate the surface of decorative objects and illuminated manuscripts, particularly [[Quran|Q'ranic]] texts became more complex and stylised.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, R., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, [World of Art series], 1999, London, p. 59 {{ISBN|978-0-500-20305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq's first art school was established during this period, allowing artisans and crafts to flourish. &lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Abassid period, in the late 12th-century, a stylistic movement of manuscript illustration and calligraphy emerged. Now known as the ''[[Baghdad School]]'' (or ''Mesopotamian School''), this movement of Islamic art was characterised by representations of everyday life and the use of highly expressive faces rather than the stereotypical characters that had been used in the past. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources.  The works were primarily scientific, philosophical, social commentary or humorous entertainments. This movement continued for at least four decades, and dominated art in the first half of the 13th-century.&lt;ref name="Online"&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry also flourished during the Abbasid period, producing notable poets including: the 9th-century Sufi poets [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] and [[Abu Nuwas|Abū Nuwās al-Ḥasan ibn Hānī al-Ḥakamī]].  

The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]] lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries) was the pre-eminent artist of the Baghdad school. His most well-known works include the llustrations for the book of the ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (Assemblies) in 1237, a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|al-Hariri]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Waiti's illustrations served as an inspiration for the 20th-century modern Baghdad art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of works in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (''The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren''), (1287); an Arabic translation of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]’ medical text, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' (1224)&lt;ref name="Online"/&gt; and the illustrated ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, Baghdad was the capital of the [[Abbasid caliphate]]; its library was unrivalled and a magnet for intellectuals around the known world. However, in 1258, Baghdad fell to the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invaders, who pillaged the city, decimating mosques, libraries and palaces, thereby destroying most of the city's literary, religious and artistic assets. The Mongols also killed between 200,000 and one million people, leaving the population totally demoralised and the city barely habitable.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, I., "Invaders: Destroying Baghdad," ''New Yorker Magazine,'' [Special edition: Annals of History], April 25, 2005, [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/25/invaders-3 Online Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi art historians view this period as a time when the "chain of pictorial art" was broken.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1400-1411 Iraq was ruled by the [[Jalayirid dynasty]]. During this time, Iraqi art and culture flourished. Between 1411 and 1469, during the rule of the [[Qara Quyunlu dynasty]] artists from different parts of the eastern Islamic world were invited to Iraq. Under the patronage of [[Pir Budaq]], son of the [[Kara Koyunlu|Qara Quyunlu]] ruler, [[Jahan Shah]] (r. 1439–67), Iranian styles from [[Tabriz]] and [[Shiraz]] and even the styles of [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] Central Asia were all brought together in Iraq. Baghdad's importance as a centre of the arts declined after Pir Budaq's death in 1466. The Qara Quyunlu period ended with the advent of the [[Aq Quyunlu]]. Though noted patrons of the arts, the Aq Quyunlu mostly focus on areas outside Iraq.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq, 1400–1600 A.D. {{!}} Chronology| work = The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/wam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1508 and 1534, Iraq came under the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]], which shifted the focus of arts to Iran. Baghdad experienced a revival in the arts during this period, and was also a centre for literary works. The poet Fuzûlî (ca. 1495–1556) wrote during the period. He wrote in the three dominant languages of his time: Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. Iraq was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1534, during the reign of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]. The Iraqi poet [[Fuzûlî]] wrote in Arabic, Persian and Turkish during this time, and continued writing poetry after Ottoman rule was established in 1534.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; During the 16th century, Baghdad underwent another period of artistic revival; Iraqi painting from this time is called the “Baghdad school” of Ottoman miniature painting.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

Iraqi experienced a cultural shift between the years 1400 and 1600 CE, which is also reflected in its arts. In the 16th century, political rule in Iraq transitioned from the [[Mongol Empire|Turco-Mongol dynasties]] to the Ottoman Empire. In its past Iraq had been a centre of [[illuminated manuscripts]] but this art form experienced a general decline during this period.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==19th-century==
Until the 20th-century, Iraq had no tradition of easel painting. Traditional art, which included metal-work, rug-making and weaving, glass-blowing, ceramic tiles, calligraphy and wall murals were widely practised during the 19th-century. Some traditional practices traced their origins back to the 9th-century Assyrians. However, in the 19th-century, mural painters were generally seen as artisans rather than artists - although in traditional Islamic society, the distinction between artists and artists was not well defined. A few named individuals are known, including the painter, Abbud 'the Jewish' Naqqash and the calligrapher, painter and decorator; [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashim al-Khattat]] ("Hashim the Calligrapher", early 20th-century) (d. 1973) and [[Niazi Mawlawi hashim]] (19th century), but relatively few details of their lives and careers are known.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th-century, the rise of nationalistic and intellectual movements across the Arab world led to calls for an Arab-lslamic cultural revival. Artists and intellectuals felt that the growth in Western influences was a threat to Arab cultural identity. At the same time as local artists began to adopt Western practices such as easel painting. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; they also searched consciously for a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Tibi, B., ''Arab Nationalism between Islam and the Nation-state'', 3rd edn., New York, Saint Martin's Press, 1997, pp. 49-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century==
The late 19th-century and early 20th-century are known as ''Nahda'' in Arabic. This term loosely translates as a "revival" or "renaissance." Nahda became an important cultural movement which influenced all art forms - architecture, literature, poetry and the visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the turn of the 20th-century, a small group of Iraqis were sent to Istanbul for military training, where painting and drawing was included as part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Tejel, J., ''Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges,'' World Scientific, 2012, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which became known as the ''Ottoman artists,'' included [[Abdul Qadir Al Rassam]] (1882-1952); Mohammed Salim Moussali (1886-?); Hassan Sami, Assem Hafith (1886-1978); Mohammed Saleh Zaki (1888-1974) and [[Mohammed Hajji Selim|Hajji Mohammed Salim]] (1883-1941).&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; were exposed to European painting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Their style of painting was realism, impressionism or romanticism. &lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, S., Mohammadzade, M.,  Naef, S. and Mehraee, M., "Cultural Continuity in Modern Iraqi Painting between 1950- 1980," ''The Scientific Journal of NAZAR Research Center (Nrc) for Art, Architecture &amp; Urbanism,'' vol.14, no.47, May 2017, pp 43-54&lt;/ref&gt; On their return to Baghdad, they set up studios and began to offer painting lessons to talented, local artists. Many of the next generation of artists began by studying with the artists from the Ottoman group. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Their public works, which included murals, public monuments and artworks in the foyers of institutions or commercial buildings, exposed Iraqi people to Western art and contributed to art appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Middle-Eastern nations began to emerge from colonial rule, a nationalist sentiment developed. Artists consciously sought out ways to combine Western art techniques with traditional art and local subject matter. In Iraq, 20th century artists were at the forefront of developing a national style, and provided a model for other Arab nations who wanted to forge their own national identities. &lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Poetry and verse remains a major art form in modern Iraq and Iraqi poets were inspired by the literature of the 15th and 16th-centuries when Iraq was the centre of Arabic world. Notable 20th-century poets include [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (1923-2007), one of the best known woman poets in the Arab world and who wrote the poem ''My Brother Jafaar'' for her brother, who was killed during the [[Al-Wathbah uprising]] in 1948; [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri|Muḥammad Mahdī al-Jawāhirī]] (1899-1997); [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] (1926-1964); [[Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati]] (1926-1999) &lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq - The arts {{!}} history - geography| work = Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Iraq/The-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ma'rif al-Rasafi (1875-1845); Abdulraziq Abdulwahed (b. 1930); the revolutionary poet, [[Muzaffar Al-Nawab]] (b. 1934); Buland Al Haidari (b. 1926) and Janil Sidiq al-Zahaiwi (1863-1936). In post-war Iraq, poetry was very much influenced by the political and social upheavals that Iraqis had experienced throughout the 20th-century and with many poets living in exile, themes of 'strangeness' and 'being a stranger' often dominated contemporary poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Altoma, S.J., "Postwar Iraqi Literature: Agonies of Rebirth", ''Books Abroad'', Vol. 46, No. 2 (Spring, 1972), pp. 211-217 DOI: 10.2307/40126073&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi poets, including Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, often turned to Iraqi folklore which they often integrated with Western mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Gohar, S.M., "Appropriating English Literature in Post-WWII Iraqi Poetry", ''The Victorian'', vol. 5, no. 2. 2017, pp 10-22&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the most influential Arab poets because he was the first to develop the free form style of poetry, and therefore a prime mover in the development of modernist poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and  Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Iraqi poetry is considerably freer than traditional verse, and is imbued with social and political awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
[[File:Murad-Net Casting.jpg|thumb|left|''Casting the Net'' photograph by [[Murad al-Daghistani]] whose work captured the life and work of every-day people in 1930s' Mosul]]
Scholars point out that very little is known about photography in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, T., ''Photography, History, Difference'', Dartmouth College Press, 2014, pp 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq was relatively slow to adopt photography as an industry and art form, due to the religious and social prohibitions on making figurative images. The first camera entered Iraq as late as 1895 when an Iraqi photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti, from Basra, returned to Iraq following a trip to India where he had studied the art of photography. He founded a photographic studio and practiced this profession for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Kalash, K., "In Digital Technology, Solar Photography is a Time-immemorial Profession, " ''Iraq Journal,''; also reproduced in: ''Alahad News'', 26 May, 2016 [http://alahadnews.net/index.php/permalink/10051.html Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decades of the 20th-century, several factors contributed to the spread of photography. Firstly, British and European archaeologists began using photography to document ancient sites in the second half of the 19th-century. Religious missionaries were also using the camera to document historic religious sites. These activities exposed local Iraqis to the technology, and provided young men with employment opportunities as photographers and camera-men assisting archaeological teams. For instance, throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the American anthropologist, [[Henry Field (anthropologist)|Professor Henry Field]] was involved in several expeditions to ancient Mesopotamian sites and in his publications, he acknowledged the assistance of Iraqi photographer by the name of Shauqat (who was a nephew of the photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti). The writer, [[Gertrude Bell]] also reports training a young boy in the process of developing photographs in Baghdad in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, G., ''The Letters of Gertrude Bell'',   Vol. 2 (1927), Project Gutenberg edition, 2004, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400461h.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; A second factor was that, in the 1920s, [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal I]] arranged for a photographic portrait of his wife, thereby popularising photographic portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the years following the first world war, a number of photographers arrived in Iraq. Some of these were displaced Armenians, who had prior experience working with precision equipment, including cameras.&lt;ref&gt;El-Hagem B., "The Armenian Pioneers of Middle Eastern Photography," ''Palestine Studies,'' pp 22-26, [http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/31_hage_1.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; These early photographers were mostly concerned with photographing military scenes and personnel. Around this time, a photographer named Tartaran, set up a studio at the entrance to the Mosul Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;Alaq, A., "The Origins of Photography in Iraq", ''Arab Pictures'', 24 December 2015, [https://blog.arabpx.com/التصوير-الفوتوغرافي-في-التاريخ-والعر-2/ Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; From there, local school children could observe the photographer at work. The influential Mosul photographer, [[Murad al-Daghistani]], who specialised in capturing the life and work of every-day people in Mosul, may have developed his passion for photography after watching Tartaran developing photographs in his dark-room. By the 1940s, the number of photographic studios had proliferated, especially in Mosul, Basra and Baghdad. Important 20th-century Iraqi photographers include: Amri Salim, Hazem Bak, Murad Daghistani, Covadis Makarian, Sami Nasrawi, Ahmed Al-Qabbani, Jassem Al-Zubaidi, Fouad Shaker and Rashad Ghazi amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest photographers used the medium to record an Iraqi way of life that was in danger of being lost as the country 'modernised'. The photographer, [[Latif al-Ani]], who is often described as the "father of Iraqi photography", was very much concerned with documenting cosmopolitan Iraqi life in the 1950s, as he saw it.&lt;ref&gt;Gronlund, M., "How Latif Al Ani Captured Iraq’s Golden Era through a Lens," ''The National,'' 6 May, 2018, [https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/how-latif-al-ani-captured-iraq-s-golden-era-through-a-lens-1.727789 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 20th-century, photography had become a popular medium for expressing social and political concerns. The artist, [[Jananne Al-Ani|Jananne al-Ani]] has explored the dichotomy of Orient/ Occident in her work, and has also used photography to question the wearing of the veil while Halim Alkarim uses blurred images to suggest the political instability of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dabbagh, S., "Photographing Against the Grain: A History of Photography," Part I, ''Contemporary Practices,'' vol. 5, pp 40-51 [http://www.contemporarypractices.net/essays/volumeixphotographing%20against%20the%20grain.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Old city of Basra 1954.jpg|thumb|Shanashil (distinctive oriel window) in Basra, 1954]]
Modern architecture presented contemporary architects with a major challenge. A continuous tradition of both domestic and public architecture was evident, but failed to conform with modern materials and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th-century, architecture employed new styles and new materials and public taste became progressively modern. The period was characterised by original designs produced by local architects, who had been trained in Europe, including: [[Mohamed Makiya]], Makkiyya al-Jadiri, Mazlum, Qatan Adani and [[Rifat Chadirji]].&lt;ref&gt;Munif, A.R., "The Monument of Freedom," ''The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle Easern Studies,'' Spring, 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like visual artists, Iraqi architects searched for a distinctly national style of architecture and this became a priority in the 20th-century. Mohammed Makkiyya and Rifat Chadirji were the two most influential architects in terms of defining modern Iraqi architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Elsheshtawy, Y. (ed), ''Planning Middle Eastern Cities: An Urban Kaleidoscope'', Routledge, 2004, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Chadirji, who wrote a seminal book on Iraqi architecture, called this approach ''international regionalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958.

Architects sought an architectural language that would remind visitors of ancient Iraqi architectural history.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, architects used Iraqi motifs in their designs&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century,'' University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated traditional design practices, such as temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light within their work.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects also became designers who designed furniture and lighting with reference to the peculiarities of Iraqi climate, culture and material availability.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

As cities underwent a period of "modernisation" in the early decades of the 20th-century, traditional structures came under threat and subject to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958.

The architect, Rifat Chadirji along with his father, Kamil Chadirji, feared the [[vernacular architecture]] and ancient monuments would be lost to the new development associated with the oil boom in the mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; They documented the region photographically and in 1995, published a book entitled, ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' which recorded the buildings and lifestyles of the Iraqi people.&lt;ref&gt;Chadirji, R., ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' London, I.B. Tauris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, [[Lorna Selim]], who taught drawing at [[Baghdad University]]'s Department of Architecture, in the 1960s took her students to sketch traditional buildings along the Tigris and was especially interested in exposing young architects to Iraq's [[vernacular architecture]], alley-ways and historical monuments. The work of Selim and Chadirji inspired a new generation of architects to consider including traditional design features - such as Iraqi practices of temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light - in their designs.&lt;ref&gt;Uduku, O.

=== Visual arts===
During the first three decades of the 20th-century, there was little progress in art. Following World War One, a group of Polish officers, who had been part of the Foreign Legion,&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Baghdad and introduced local artists to a European style of painting, which in turn fostered a public appreciation of art. The Institute of Fine Arts and the Fine Arts Society were established in 1940-41 &lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, D., ''Images of Enchantment: Visual and Performing Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi Artists' Society was founded in 1956, after which many exhibitions were mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, British rule was overthrown and [[Abdul Karim Qasim]] assumed power. This led to triumphant demonstrations and expressions of national pride. In early 1959, Qasim commissioned [[Jawad Saleem]] to create ''[[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)|Nasb al-Hurriyah]]'' (''Monument to Freedom,'')  to commemorate Iraq's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, N., "Political Modernism, Jabrā, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group," ''CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture,'' Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&amp;context=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes] in: ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began to look to their history for inspiration and employed arabesque geometry and calligraphy as visual elements in their compositions, and referred to folk tales and scenes drawn from everyday life for artistic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, the Ba'ath Party mounted a program to beautify the city of Baghdad which led to numerous public art works being commissioned. Designed to instil a sense of national pride within the population, and to immortalise the leader, Saddam Hussein, these works provided work opportunities to the nation's architects, engineers and sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;al-Kalil, S., ''Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, artists showed a distinct preference for abstract works, which allowed them to evade censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The "Free" art of Occupation: Images for a "New" Iraq," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 28, No. 3/4 2006, pp. 41-53&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] and [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier]] and the [[Victory Arch]], along with many smaller statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed in the second half of the 20th-century, and showing increasing levels of abstraction over time. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the Iraqi visual arts scene lies in artists' desires to link tradition and modernity in artworks. For a number of artists, the use of calligraphy or script has become an important part of integrating traditional artistic elements into an abstract artwork. In this way, the use of letters connects Iraqi artists with the broader [[hurufiyya movement]] (also known as the ''North African Lettrist Movement).'' The Iraqi artist, [[Madiha Omar]], who was active from the mid-1940s, was one of the pioneers of the hurufiyya movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington as early as 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119; Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], Online: https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

===Art groups===

The 20th-century Iraqi arts scene is notable for the number of different art groups or art movements that emerged in the post-colonial period. Each of these groups sought to forge a national art aesthetic that acknowledged Iraq's deep art heritage and incorporated it in contemporary artworks. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include:

====''Al-Ruwad'' (The Pioneers) ====
: The Pioneers, Iraq's first modern art group, was formed by painter, [[Faeq Hassan|Faiq Hassan]] in the 1930s. This group was stimulated by the contact between Iraqi artists and European artists who had resided in Iraq during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; This group consciously developed a distinct Iraqi style by incorporating local phenomena and traditional village life into artworks. &lt;ref&gt; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected the artificial atmosphere of the artist’s studio and encouraged artists to engage with nature and traditional Iraqi life. They held their first exhibition in 1931.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

:This group was responsible for taking the first steps towards bridging the gap between modernity and heritage. Artists active in the group had been educated abroad, returned with a European aesthtic, yet wanted to paint local scenes and landscapes. Members included: [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Jawad Saleem]], Ismail al Sheikhli, Nadhim Ramzi and the architect-painter, Kamil Chadirji.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The group continued to meet into the 1970s, although some of its high profile members withdrew from the group at different times. For instance, Faeq Hassan left the group in 1962. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] also broke away from the Pioneers and formed a different group in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (The Avantgarde Group and later known as the Primitive Group)====
: Formed in 1950, the ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (Avantgarde Group) was inspired by Mespotamian art and Iraqi folklore. It later changed its name to the ''Primitive Group.''&lt;ref&gt; Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The group was initially led by [[Faeq Hassan]] (Baghdad 1914-1992) and later by Isma'il al-Shaykhali (Turkey b. 1927). Artists in this group were inspired by ancient art of the 13th-century [[Baghdad School]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group included: Ismail Al-Sheikhly, Issa Hanna, Zeid Salih, [[Mahmoud  Sabri]], Khalid Al Qassab, Dr Qutaiba Al Sheikh Nouri, Dr Nouri Mutafa Bahjat, Kadhem Hayder, [[Nuri al-Rawi]], Ghazi Al Saudi, Mahmoud Ahmed, Mohammed Ali Shakir, Sami Haqqi, Hassan Abid Alwan, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Lorna Selim|Lorna Saleem]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khamis, U. (ed.), "An Historical Overview: 1900s-1990s," in: ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

: Under B'ath rule, the group grew in prestige, and its members were frequently offered lucrative posts at the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; This group was one of the more enduring, and continued meeting throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Jama’et  Baghdad  lil  Fen  al-Hadith'' (The  Baghdad  Modern  Art  Group)====
: Established in 1951, by [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], after they broke away from the Pioneers group,&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; its aims were to reassert a national identity and use art to build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced its ancient heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, the group's leader promoted the idea of ''istilham al-turath'' – "seeking inspiration from tradition" and wrote a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founder, Hassan, wrote that, after the 1958 independence, artists were no longer responsible for preserving art and culture, instead the state was responsible for "turath" - safeguarding public taste; all that remained was for artists to absorb turath, free from historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, and others, believed that earlier artists, such as Jawad Saleem, had shouldered too great a burden of historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; This group is credited with being the first Islamic art group to develop a local style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

: While the Modern Art Group sought to connect with Islamic tradition, the group was distinguished from earlier art groups in that it sought to express modern life, while keeping tradition and heritage in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Key members of this group included: Nuri al-Rawi (b. 1925) who became the Minister for Culture; [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1920-1994); [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] (1929-2011); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987) and 'Atta Sabri (1913-1987), all of whom had been members from the group's foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Mahmud Sabri (1927-2012); Tariq Mazlum (b.1933), [[Nuri al-Rawi]] (b. 1925), Mahmoud Sabri (b. 1927), Ata Sabri (b.1913), and [[Kadhim Hayder]].&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69; Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Baghdad Modern Art Group was moribund within a decade of its formation.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; One of its co-founders, Jawad Saleem died in 1961, while the other co-founder, Shakir Hassan Al Said, suffered a mental and spiritual crisis as a result of the continuing turbulence and political instability following the 1958 revolution and the overthrow of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt;   

====''The Impressionists'' ====
: The Impressionists emerged in 1953, and organised around the artist, [[Hafidh al-Droubi]] (1914-1991), who had trained in London and had turned to impressionism and cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278; Faraj, M., ''Strokes Of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, a trend towards abstraction was evident amongst Iraqi artists, who wanted to embrace a more modern aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; However, al-Droubi pointed out that the Iraqi landscape, with its endless horizons, bright colours and open fields, was quite different to European landscapes and required different techniques. Unlike the art groups that preceded it, the Impressionists published no manifesto, and lacked the philosophical underpinnings evident in the Baghdad Modern Art Group or the New Vision.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Haydari, B., "Jawad Salim and Faiq Hasan and the Birth of Modern Art in Iraq," ''Ur,'' Vol. 4, 1985,  p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Al Mujadidin'' (The Innovationists)====
: Established in 1965, the ''Al Mujadidin'' was formed by a group of younger artists including: [[Salim al-Dabbagh]], [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Saleh al-Jumai'e]] and [[Ali Talib (artist)| Ali Talib]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 50-51; Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Group members were united along intellectual, rather than stylistic grounds. This group, which lasted only four years,&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; rebelled against traditional art styles and explored the use of new materials such as collage, aluminum and mono-type.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, C., "The Reason for the Project Art in Iraq Today", in: Azzawi, D. (ed.), ''Art in Iraq Today'', Abu Dhabi, Skira and Meem, 2011, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; These artists exhibited distinct individual styles, but often chose war and conflict for their themes, especially the 1967 war.&lt;ref&gt;Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M.,  ''Modernism and Iraq'', Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University, New York, 2009, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Majmueat Al-Zawiya'' (The Corners Group)====
: Simply known as the al-Zawiya group, it was founded in 1967 by [[Faeq Hassan]], against a highly political backdrop.  This group wanted to use art to focus on social and political issues and to serve national causes. The group held just one exhibition in its inaugural year. &lt;ref&gt;"Profile: Faik Hassan," ''Al Jazeera'', 31 October, 2005, [https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html Online"]; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 141; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'' (The New Vision) ====
: Following decades of war and conflict, culminating in the July Revolution of 1958, artists began to feel free to find inspiration in a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Culture and Arts, ''Culture and arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17–30 Revolution,'' The Ministry, Iraq, 1978, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the Baghdad Modern Art Group contributed to an environment where many artists worked individually, developing their own style, while still maintaining the broad trends of the Modern Baghdad Art group. Founded in 1968, by artists  [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]; Muhammed  Muhr al-Din, Hashimi al-Samarchi, Salih Jumai'e, Rafa al-Nadiri and [[Dia Azzawi]], &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'', represented a free art style where many artists believed that they needed to be true to their own era.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"/&gt; This group promoted the idea of freedom of creativity within a framework of heritage.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"/&gt; 

:The group's manifesto articulated the need for new and daring ideas, &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and read in part:

{{Blockquote|"We believe that heritage is not a prison, a static phenomenon or a force capable of repressing creativity so long as we have the freedom to accept or challenge its norms... We are the new generation. We demand change, progression and creativity. Art stands in opposition to stasis. Art is continually creative. It is a mirror to the present moment and it’s the soul of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Q., "Contemporary Iraqi Art: Origins and Development," ''Scope'' vol. 3, November, 2008, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''Jama’et al-Bu’d al Wahid'' ([[One Dimension Group]]) ====
: Founded in around 1971 by the Iraqi artist and intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], this group sought a new artistic identity, drawn from within Iraqi culture and heritage. The group's founder, Al Said, published a manifesto for the group in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,''  in which he outlined his vision for a national art aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex.

====Other 20th-century groups ====
Other art groups, including the ''Triangle Group'', the ''Shadows'' (formed by [[Ali Talib (artist)|Ali Talib]]) and the ''Academicians'' formed throughout the 1970s, but few lasted for more than a year or two.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' (The Wall Group)====
: Established in 2007, this group of artists, many students at the Institute of Fine Arts, work on public projects in order to beautify the city of Baghdad. Paid a very modest stipend by the Ministry of Works, these artists have painted concrete slabs along the Tigris River, thereby transforming ruins left over from the revolution into modern works of art. (The slabs had previously served as protection from bombardment.) Although this group did little to develop a new aesthetic, it was able to provide employment and encouragement for young artists, who at that time were operating in a void since most of the artists of the preceding generation were living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 95- 96; Farrell, S., "With Fixtures of War as Their Canvas, Muralists Add Beauty to Baghdad," ''New York Times,'' August 11, 2007, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/world/middleeast/11murals.html Online:]; Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Artists active in ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' include  Ali Saleem Badran and Gyan Shrosbree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B., "Artists resist pressure to be more sectarian," Associated Press and Charlotte Observer, July 26, 2008 [http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article8995490.html#storylink=cpy Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable Iraqi artists===

[[File:20160102-Tahrir square Baghdad.jpg|thumb|''Nasb al-Hurriyah'' [[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)]], a sculpture by [[Jawad Saleem]], 1959-1961]]
Iraq has produced a number of world-class painters and sculptors including [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]] (1934-2008), Khalid Al-Jadir (1924-1990), and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Faeq Hassan]] (1914-1992), considered the founder of modern [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] in Iraq, was among several Iraqi artists who were selected to study art at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] before the [[Second World War]]. Hassan and the art group he founded formed the foundation of Iraq's strong 20th-century artistic tradition. Hassan founded the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad; many of Iraq's best known artists studied at this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Profile: Faik Hassan - Al Jazeera English| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jawad Saleem]] (b. 1919) is a painter and sculptor from Baghdad who (together with [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat|Mohammed Ghani]] (1929-2011) and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Hassan Shakir]]) (1925-2004), founded the influential Baghdad Modern Art Group in 1951. Saleem was commissioned to create the ''Monument of Freedom'' in Baghdad's city centre overlooking Liberation Square.&lt;ref name=kember&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Kember| first = Pamela| title = Benezit Dictionary of Asian Artists| accessdate = July 20, 2017| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleem, and his student, [[Khaled al-Rahal]] have been described as "the two pillars of modern Iraqi art." &lt;ref&gt; Kahalid al-Kishtyan in 1981, cited in: Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, pp 265-309 and in Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dia Azzawi]]{{'}}s (b. 1939) work, described as contemporary art, includes references to [[Arabic calligraphy]], as well as [[Sumer]]ian and [[Assyria]]n art.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; Azzawi has been the inspiration for many contemporary [[calligraffiti]] artists. 

[[Jamil Hamoudi]] (1924-2003) is both a painter and sculptor. Like Azzawi, Hamoudi also studied at the Baghdad School of Fine Art. He was interested in the [[cubist]] movement and in 1947, he self-identified with the [[surrealist]] movement, only to later distance himself citing "A dark, saturnine atmosphere emanated from [their canvases] the effect of which was to arouse a feeling of despair in human beings."  His paintings are brightly coloured and make use of shapes like circles, triangles and arches. For sculpture he frequently uses plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; In 1973 he was appointed to the directorship of the Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture. 

Other notable artists include: [[Madiha Omar]] (1908–2005) who is regarded as a pioneer of the [[Hurufiyya movement]]; [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (1925-2004); [[Hassan Massoudy]] (b. 1944); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987); Saadi Al Kaabi (b 1937); Ismael Al Khaid (b. abt 1900) and [[Rafa al-Nasiri]] (b. 1940).

==Recent developments==

From 1969, the [[Arab nationalist]] political agenda of the [[Baath party|Ba'ath Party]] encouraged Iraqi artists to create work that would explain Iraq's new national identity in terms of its historical roots. The Iraqi Ministry of Culture is involved in efforts to preserve tradition Irai crafts like leatherworking, copper working, and carpet making.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;
[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|The toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in [[Firdos Square]], Baghdad shortly after the Iraq War invasion. The removal of statues was part of a de-Ba'athification process]]
In 2003, during the overthrow of the Ba'ath government, key institutions, including the Pioneers Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, were looted and vandalised. Approximately 8,500 paintings and sculptures, especially were stolen or vandalised. The occupying forces insisted on a voluntary return of stolen artworks, a position which resulted in very few works being returned. A few independent galleries purchased artworks with a view to returning them once a suitable national museum could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; A committee, headed by the respected artist and sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], was formed with the objective of recovering stolen artworks and proved somehwat more effective.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 105 -120; Sabrah, S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, some 1,500 artworks had been recovered, including important works, such as the statue, ''Motherhood'' by Jawad Saleem.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, attempts at de-Ba'athification have been evident, with the announcement of plans to rid Baghdad's cityscape of monuments constructed during Saddam Husssein's rule. However, due to public pressure, plans have been made to store such monuments rather than arrange for their total destruction as had occurred in previous regimes. In addition, efforts are underway to erect new monuments which display significant figures from Iraq's history and culture. Recent developments also include plans to conserve and convert the former homes of Iraqi artists and intellectuals, inclduing the artist, Jawad Saleem, the poet, [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Future Pasts: Iraq in a State of Suspension," in: ''Through the roadblocks: Realities in Raw Motion: Conference Reader,'' School of Fine and Applied Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, 2012, pp 89-102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Iraq was again involved in violence as coalition forces entered the country. Many artists fled Iraq. The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The number of artists living abroad has created opportunities for new galleries in London and other major centres to mount exhibitions featuring the work of exiled artists from Iraqi and Middle Eastern. One such gallery is Soho's Pomegranate gallery established in the 1970s by the modernist Iraqi sculptor, Oded Halahmy, which not only mounts exhibitions, but also holds permanent collections of notable Iraqi artists. &lt;ref&gt;Hope, B., "Iraqi Art - in New York," ''New York Sun,'' March 3, 2006; Riccardo, B., Hamit, B. and Sluglett,P., ''Writing the Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges,''World Scientific, 2012  pp 490-93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortages of art materials were commonplace in the aftermath of war.&lt;ref&gt;Rellstab, F.H. and  Schlote, C., ''Representations of War, Migration, and Refugeehood: Interdisciplinary Perspectives,'' Routledge,  2014, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, visual artists such as [[Hanaa Malallah]] and [[Sadik Kwaish Alfraji ]] turned to "found objects" and incorporated these into their artworks. Malallah consciously included shrapnel and bullets in her paintings and called this the ''Ruins Technique'' which allows her to not only make statements about war, but also to explore how objects become ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Asfahani, R., "Interview With Hanaa Malallah: Iraq’s Pioneering Female Artist," ''Culturetrip,'' 29 November 2016, [https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iraq/articles/interview-with-hanaa-malallah-iraq-s-pioneering-female-artist/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature, art and architecture are cultural assets in Iraq. However, certain archaeological sites, and museums have been ransacked by Islamic terrorists, notably the ancient city of Nimrud, near Mosul;&lt;ref&gt;Shaheen, K., "Outcry over ISIS destruction of Ancient Assyrian site of Nimrud," ''The Guardian,'' March 7, 2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/isis-destroys-ancient-assyrian-site-of-nimrud Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; the  Adad and Mashqi gates at Nineveh; the ancient city of Hatra &lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, A., "Photos of Ancient Landmarks and World Heritage Sites Destroyed by Terrorist Groups," ''International Business Times,'' August 23, 2016, [https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/photos-ancient-landmarks-world-heritage-sites-destroyed-by-terrorist-groups-1577633 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has described acts of cultural vandalism as ''war crimes.'' &lt;ref&gt;Cullinane, S., Alkhshali, H. and Tawfee, M., "Tracking a Trail of Historical Obliteration: ISIS Trumpets Destruction of Nimrud," ''CNN News,'' [https://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/09/world/iraq-isis-heritage/index.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Islamic militants invaded the city of Mosul, destroying ancient monuments and statues, which they perceived to be blasphemous, and ransacked the History Museum. Mostafa Taei, a resident of [[Hamam al-Alil]] was jailed by [[ISIL]] when the terrorists took over his town in 2014. ISIL banned any images or artworks of the human form, and Taei says he was beaten when the group learned that he was still painiting. During this period, Taei's art "took a subversive turn, becoming a gruesome record of atrocities: decapitations, hangings, injured children and sobbing widows, all painted in an unschooled Naive art style." He also started to paint "martyr posters" that depict the soldiers and police officers who have died during the military operations to liberate [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = MacDiarmid| first = Campbell| title = Iraqi artist depicts life under ISIL| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/iraqi-artist-depicts-life-isil-170502162738617.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Nada Shabout, notes that the destruction of Iraqi art in the period after 2003, assumed both tangible and intangible forms. Not only were the artworks and art institutions looted or destroyed, but art production also suffered from the lack of availability of art materials and the loss of many intellectuals, including artists, who were forced into exile. This contributed to an environment that failed to nurture artists, and saw young, upcoming artists operating in a void.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi monumental artworks, both ancient and modern, feature prominently on banknotes of the [[Iraqi dinar]].

'''Irish Fiscal Advisory Council''' ('''IFAC'''; {{lang-ga|Comhairle Chomhairleach Bhuiséadach na hÉireann}}) is a non-department statutory body providing independent assessment and analysis of the Irish Government's economic and budgetary forecasts, and fiscal approach.  IFAC monitors compliance with EU fiscal rules and agreements.  IFAC was created to counter the "[[green jersey agenda]]" which was identified as a contributor to the Irish financial crisis.

==Purpose==

IFAC was formed as part of a program of reform of Ireland’s "budgetary architecture" post the Irish economic crisis.  It was established on an interim basis in July 2011, and legally constituted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FRA.pdf|title=Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 | publisher=Department of Finance | date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland (and whose terms required the creation of a "budgetary advisory council to provide an independent assessment of Government forecasts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2010/nov/28/ireland-bailout-full-government-statement|title=Ireland bailout: full Irish government statement|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IFAC_DoF_Forecasting_MoU_2018_Signed.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance relating to the “Endorsement Function” of the Council under the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013|publisher=IFAC Department of Finance|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formation of IFAC was a response to the perceived failure of established Irish economic and Irish regulatory institutions to anticipate and warn over the consequences of the Irish credit bubble (i.e. the so-called "[[put on the green jersey|green jersey agenda"]]), and/or engage in the concerns that were being raised by various international monitors at the time (IMF and OECD) regarding Ireland's economic situation.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/failure-to-heed-warnings-was-cause-of-crash-trichet-30949719.html|title=Failure to heed warnings was cause of crash: Trichet | publisher=Irish Independent | date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/banking-inquiry/fitzgerald-my-regrets-over-crash-are-with-me-until-i-die-30985532.html|title=FitzGerald: My regrets over crash are with me until I die|publisher=Irish Independent|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC performs a similar role to the "[[Office for Budget Responsibility]]" in the United Kingdom (also formed after the financial crisis), and other equivalent members of the "[[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network|Network of European Union Independent Fiscal Institutions]]" (which IFAC joined in September 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/what-is-the-irish-fiscal-advisory-council-for-31277271.html|title=What is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for? | publisher=Irish Independent | date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/john-mchale-the-man-whose-job-it-is-to-say-no-minister-30087657.html|title=John McHale The man whose job it is to say 'No Minister' | publisher=Irish Independent | date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC is structured as a Council of 5 members (one Chairperson) and a supporting analytical team of circa 6.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/Ireland.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=OECD Journal on Budgeting | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audgen.gov.ie/documents/annualreports/2015/report/en/Chapter18.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=C&amp;AG Report 2015 | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (per IFAC website) is to:
* Assess and endorse the Irish Government’s official macroeconomic forecasts.
* Assess the Irish Government's budgetary forecasts.
* Assess the broader fiscal stance of the Irish Government.
* Monitor compliance with legislated fiscal rules by the Irish Government.

IFAC has been well received by Irish financial commentators and its publications are widely covered in the Irish media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/fiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fopinion%2Feditorial%2Ffiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833|title=Fiscal Advisory Council’s timely warning|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fiscal-council-budget-2018-3581853-Sep2017/|title=Fiscal Council says Ireland is still vulnerable and warns against extra Budget spending|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chairman-fiscal-advisory-council-theres-been-a-very-strong-recovery-we-are-now-living-within-our-means-36500320.html|title=Chairman, Fiscal Advisory Council: 'There's been a very strong recovery - we are now living within our means'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/opinion/jack-horgan-jones-mchales-advice-ignored-ifac-not-afraid-bare-teeth-371851|title=Even if the government refuses listen, having this kind of analysis in the public domain is vital|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70b38194-f568-11e3-91a8-00144feabdc0|title=Ireland needs continued austerity says watchdog|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The key mandated publications of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are:
* Bi-annual Fiscal Assessment Report (FAR) (produced after the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/fiscal-assessment-reports/|title=Fiscal Assessment Reports|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has commenced an annual conference titled “Path for the Public Finances” that was started in March 2017. The goal is to bring attention to long-term Irish State finance issues relevant for Ireland. International speakers attend.  Each annual event is intended to focus on a particular theme, which has been:
* March 2017 Path for the Public Finances: Fiscal Risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/path-for-the-public-finances-2017-fiscal-risks/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2017 Fiscal Risks|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 2018 Path for the Public Finances: Too Hot, Too Cold! The Irish Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ifac-conference/path-for-the-public-finances-2018-too-hot-too-cold-the-irish-cycle/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2018 Too Hot Too Cold The Irish Cycle|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC also publishes Analytical Notes and Working Papers in areas of concern to Irish financial stability (including House Prices, Tax Receipts, Public Debt, and EU Rules/Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/analytical-notes/|title=IFAC Analytical Notes Series|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==

The IFAC looks at major areas that could affect the stability and confidence levels of Irish macroeconomic forecasts, and/or, create the potential for economic shocks.

===Distortion of Irish GDP and GNP===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland is a leading [[corporate tax haven]] (see [[Corporate haven#Corporate tax haven lists|Corporate tax haven lists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=Study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme distortions of national economic data is a well-known feature of [[corporate tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name="qqtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|publisher=Quartz|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil, FINANCE &amp; DEVELOPMENT, JUNE 2018, VOL. 55, NO. 2 |publisher=IMF Finance &amp; Development|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top 15 GDP-per-capita countries are heavily represented by traditional and corporate tax havens (see [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|GDP-per-capita and tax havens]]).  The artificial nature of the distortion makes the haven prone to more severe credit cycles as international capital markets misprice the cost of credit to the tax haven in benign times, only to reverse it sharply in  times of global stress (see [[Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|tax haven cycles]]).  

{{quote|A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens.

IFAC was one of the members of the economic steering group ((the Economic Statistics Review Group, or "ESRG"), that [[Philip R. Lane]], the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], convened to create a new economic statistic to replace Irish GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/newsevents/documents/reportoftheeconomicstatisticsreviewgroup/ESRG_Presentation_-_Press_Briefing.pdf|title=ESRG Presentation and CSO Response|publisher=Central Statistics Office|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2017/0204/850115-leprechaun-economics/|title=Leprechaun-proofing economic data|publisher=RTE News|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric, also called GNI*, is circa 30% below Irish GDP.&lt;ref name="gni1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cso-paints-a-very-different-picture-of-irish-economy-with-new-measure-1.3155462|title=CSO paints a very different picture of Irish economy with new measure|publisher=Irish Times|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gni2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/new-economic-leprechaun-on-loose-as-rate-of-growth-plunges-35932663.html|title=New economic Leprechaun on loose as rate of growth plunges|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Ireland has, more or less, stopped using GDP to measure its own economy. And on current trends [because Irish GDP is distorting EU-28 aggregate data], the eurozone taken as a whole may need to consider something similar.|author=[[Brad Setser]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], "Ireland exports its Leprechaun", 25 April 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/ireland-exports-its-leprechaun|title=Ireland Exports its Leprechaun|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Irish Public Debt===
{{see also|Leprechaun economics}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland's economic data is distorted by the tax planning schemes of US multinationals based in Ireland (i.e. "[[double Irish]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While traditionally this distortion manifested itself in divergences between Ireland's GDP and GNI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2013/04/gdp-and-international-comparisons.html|title=International GNI to GDP Comparisons|publisher=Seamus Coffey, University College Cork|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the schemes have become more developed (i.e. "[[double Irish|capital allowances for intangibles]]"), Irish GNI and GNP have also become materially distorted.  This was most evident in the "[[leprechaun economics]]" affair when Apple restructured its controversial Irish operations (the subject of the EU Commission's €13bn fine) in January 2015 and Irish GDP rose 26.3% while Irish GNP rose 18.7%.

The problem of assessing Ireland's public indebtedness post "[[leprechaun economics]]" and "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]", is captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland Survey:&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OECD-survey.pdf|title=OECD Ireland Survey 2018|publisher=OECD|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GDP basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 78.8% is not of concern.
* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GNI* basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 116.5% is more serious, but not alarming.
* On a Gross Public Debt Per Capita basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at over $62,686 per capita, exceeds every other OECD country, except Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/national-debt-now-44000-per-head-35904197.html|title=National debt now €44000 per head|publisher=Irish Independent|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC introduced a new measure of benchmarking Irish public debt by comparing to Tax Revenues (similar to the Debt-to-EBITDA ratio used in capital markets).  On this basis, Ireland's 2016 Gross Public Debt-to-Tax Revenues is 282.9%, which is the 4th highest of the EU-28 (after Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Presentation.pdf|title=Debt levels remain high following the crisis June FAR Slide 7 | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Final.pdf|title=Section 1.2.2 Recent Fiscal Context June FAR Page 14  | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows how difficult making Ireland's EU Debt Rule committments will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Website-AN5.pdf | title=Future Implications of the Debt Rule | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, IFAC advised the Irish Government against using funds, or proceeds from State asset sales, to stimulate the fast-growing Irish economy, and instead use for debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0607/880813-national-debt-it-hasnt-gone-away-you-know/|title=National Debt - it hasn't gone away, you know | publisher=RTE News | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Multinationals===
{{see also|Corporate tax haven}}

Eurostat (2015)]]
Corporation tax was 15.1% of Irish tax revenues in 2016 with 80% coming from foreign-owned multinationals.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irish corporate tax revenue jumped 49% in 2015 alone (from €4.61bn to €6.87bn),&lt;ref name="rev1"/&gt; the year of Apple's Irish restructuring.  This is in an environment where foreign-owned multinationals, attracted to Ireland's corporate tax system, contributed €28.3bn in payments to the Irish economy in 2016 (corporate taxes, wages, and capital spending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also in an environment where the 2017 US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] legislation, and the EU "digital tax" (and [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]), are threats to the Irish corporate tax system. 

IFAC have reported on the volatility and concentration of Ireland corporation tax payments, with the top 20 payers now making up almost 40% of all corporation tax payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AN-10-Challenges-Forecasting-Irish-Corporation-Tax-Final-Web.pdf|title=Analytical Note 10 Challenges Forecasting Irish Corporation Tax |publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairperson of IFAC, Seamus Coffey, was separately commissioned by the Irish Government to review Ireland's Corporate Tax Code.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Department of Finance|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170912-Review-of-Irelands-Corporation-Tax-Code.pdf|title=REVIEW OF IRELAND’S CORPORATION TAX CODE, PRESENTED TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM BY MR. SEAMUS COFFEY|publisher=Department of Finance|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While corporate tax recipts were found to be sustainable for the near future (to 2020),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/strong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fstrong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290|title=Strong corporate tax receipts ‘sustainable’ until 2020| publisher=Irish Times|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was recommended that some multinational tax allowances be scaled back (i.e. capital allowances capped at 80%) to improve tax revenue sustainability.

IFAC noted Ireland’s exposure to U.S. multinationals in the June 2018 report and the impact of a single multinational leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/losing-just-one-big-multinational-would-leave-ireland-nursing-a-276m-tax-shortfall-36981003.html|title=Losing just one big multinational would leave Ireland nursing a €276m tax shortfall|publisher=Irish Independent|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. multinationals (14 of Ireland's top 20 firms, a quarter of the Irish labourforce), is discussed in more detail [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]].  The former IMF mission chief to Ireland, [[Ashoka Mody]], has emphasised how the changes to international tax regimes (i.e. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]), could make this event likely, and on a bigger and synchronised scale (discussed [[Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|here]]):

=== Laboratory of Bio-Chemistry ===
[[Image:Laboratory of Bio-Chemistry, Johnston Laboratories 1903.jpg|center|300px|frame|&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;Laboratory of Bio-Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{cquote|''The Bio-Chemical Laboratory occupies the entire top floor, and consists of four rooms fitted up solely for research work upon chemical problems connected with the various departments of biological science.

The principal room is 60 feet long and 30 feet wide, and is well lighted by ten large windows, 12 feet by 9 feet, the small remaining wall space being faced with white-glazed tiles, a wall cupboard being fixed to each pier to hold stock reagents and standard solutions. A complete belt of benches runs round the walls, and the middle of the room is practically divided into four working compartments by two large H-shaped benches, having an outside measurement of 22 feet by 16 feet. By this arrangement the laboratory is divided into bays in which investigators can work surrounded on all sides by working benches. The floor of the rooms and the tops of the benches are constructed of polished lito-silo, a material which lends itself well to such purposes on account of its resiliency, warmth, and non-absorbent properties. Drawers and presses are fitted underneath the benches for the storage of materials and apparatus, a free space being, however, left in the middle of each working space for convenience in sitting. Two large fume chambers, 9 feet by 3 feet, are built into the central benches, one at each end of the room, and contain six gas jets, regulated from outside, so that the fittings cannot be attacked by the fumes. Sinks are arranged in the wall benches opposite each pier, and each of the large central benches is provided with eight sinks. In addition, there are two large sinks placed one at either end of the room for washing glass apparatus. Steam is provided by a main pipe carried up the track of the lift and conducted along the wall on one side of the room for a distance of 1 8 feet, distribution taps with screw-down valves being provided at intervals of 3 feet for the attachment of steam baths and other heating appliances. The steam supply is also made use of for the production of distilled water by means of a suitable apparatus.

Opening from the south end of the large room is the Professor's Research Room, measuring 20 feet by 16 feet, provided with working bench, fume chamber, and cupboards.

To the east of this room, and communicating both with it and with the large room, is the Balance Room, provided with slate slabs for the support of the balances, let into the wall to ensure greater steadiness. The walls of this room are lined with bookcases, and there are wr1ting tables under the windows.

The fourth room, situated on the west side of the Professor's room is designed as a working library for the use of workers in the laboratory, and is fitted up with bookcases and a writing table.

The whole laboratory is admirably lighted by large windows, and is fitted with the electric light. It is warmed by hot water, and ventilated by the upper parts of the windows and by extraction shafts arranged down the centre.

This is the first laboratory that has been constructed in Great Britain solely for carrying out research work in bio-chemistry.''|40px|40px|&amp;#160;|The Opening of the Johnston Laboratories}}

=== Laboratories of Experimental Medicine and Cancer Research ===
[[Image:Laboratory of Experimental Medicine and Cancer Research, Johnston Laboratories 1903.jpg|center|frame|&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;Laboratories of Experimental Medicine and Cancer Research&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{cquote|''The department of Experimental Medicine is housed on the first floor. One end of the rectangle is taken up by the Director of the Cancer Research. This room has window benches along the south and east sides, while in the centre are two tables, fitted with drawers, and with sinks at each end. The room has been equipped with all necessary apparatus for the histological and experimental investigation of cancer. Attention may be drawn especially to a very fine microscope by {{Smallcaps|Swift}}, and a new mincing machine by {{Smallcaps|Cogit}}, of [[Paris]], by which tissues can be reduced to a state fine enough for injection with an ordinary syringe.

In the machine room in the basement is a centrifuge and disintegrator belonging to the equipment of the Research.

The other (north) end of the rectangle is divided into two private research rooms, each having two windows. The intervening portion is divided by a narrow corridor, on the east side of which are (1) the attendants' compartment, with large sink for washing up, shelves, etc., and a large slate on which are placed the autoclave and {{Smallcaps|Koch's}} sterilizer connected with the laboratory steam supply; (2) the incubator room, which is glazed up to the ceiling, in it are placed the incubator and the hot-air sterilizer, on slabs, and the glass-blower's table; (3) a small room at present used for stores.

On the west side, next the entrance door and just opposite the Director's room, is the electrical room. In this is placed out of reach and danger an induction X-ray coil, giving a 24-inch spark; while on the floor is a series of accumulators, charged from the main, for working the coil. A complete outfit for X-ray work is provided; also a small resonator for applying the high frequency current and a large solenoid within which the patient can be placed. A new model arc lamp for investigating the therapeutic action of light, taking a current of fifty amperes, is also fixed in this room. It can be carefully darkened if necessary. Beyond this is a room for experimental pathology, and after this another research room. The Director's, the incubator, and the electrical room are glazed to the ceiling ; the others are separated by screens or cupboards, seven feet high, and the corridor is formed in the same way. There is consequently through ventilation for the whole floor. The fume chamber is placed in the corridor, and ventilates into the main flue.

Belonging to the Cancer Research is also a greenhouse, in which animals accustomed to a tropical climate can be kept.''|40px|40px|&amp;#160;|The Opening of the Johnston Laboratories}}

=== Laboratories of Tropical Medicine ===

{{cquote|''These are situated on the first floor of the Johnston Laboratories, and are contained within a large room, about 95 feet long and 35 feet broad. The main part of the room is devoted to students, but three chambers are partitioned off for the special use of persons who wish to do research work in connexion with Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, each of these rooms having all fittings and appliances for this purpose. One end of the floor contains the professor's room and the incubator room. The whole is walled with white glazed tiles. The floor is rendered impermeable by a layer of deep red lito-silo. Along the walls of the whole floor there runs a bench for microscope work, covered with a thick layer of sea-blue lito-silo. Electric light, gas, and water are suitably fitted at distances of every four yards of this bench for the use of students. The partitions of the room are fitted with cupboards, in which the museum of tropical diseases, which the school is now purchasing, is being arranged. Steam is also laid on to the laboratory, which possesses all the necessary apparatus. There is accommodation for quite forty workers in the new laboratory of the school.''|40px|40px|&amp;#160;|The Opening of the Johnston Laboratories}}

=== Laboratories of Comparative Pathology ===

{{cquote|''The Institute of Comparative Pathology occupies the basement of the new Johnston Laboratory, and comprises the lecturer's private laboratory, a general laboratory, incubating room, sterilizing room, and a post-mortem room.

The laboratories are fitted with window benches and tables, and have a complete outfit of gas, water, and electrical fittings ; the walls are tiled with white glazed tiles, and the floors and bench tops are covered with lito-silo. Each side of the partitions dividing the area into sections is fitted with cupboards, which will be largely utilized for museum purposes. The post-mortem room will be fitted with a post-mortem table for large animals.

These laboratories will be furnished for lectures, demonstrations, and practical work in the subjects of comparative pathology and bacteriology, and also for the testing of various vaccines and sera prepared at the Institute's Farm Station. Facilities will also be afforded for acquiring the technique necessary for the manufacture of these products, and also for research work. Practical instruction in the physiological and pathological actions of these and allied substances will also be provided.

The farm in connection with the Institute is favourably situated in a most suitable and accessible agricultural district in North Cheshire. It has been provided with laboratories, fitted up with modern scientific appliances and apparatus for the production on a large scale of vaccines and sera. A general bacteriological laboratory, an incubating room, mixing, distributing, and sterilizing rooms, and a separate room specially set apart for the preparation of calf-lymph vaccine, and another room for plague prophylactic and serum, make up the laboratory accommodation.

The preparation of the various sera and vaccines will be carried on at the farm station, and opportunities will be afforded to those interested in the subject to acquire the principles of their manufacture, and also to avail themselves of the practice in veterinary science at the out-patient department shortly to be established.''|40px|40px|&amp;#160;|The Opening of the Johnston Laboratories}}

However, the influence of humans has often contributed to kelp forest degradation.

== Kelp ==
{{main|Kelp}}

The term [[kelp]] refers to [[marine algae]] belonging to the [[Order (biology)|order]] Laminariales (phylum: [[Heterokontophyta]]). Though not considered a taxonomically diverse order, kelps are highly diverse structurally and functionally.&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"/&gt; The most widely recognized species are the giant kelps (''[[Macrocystis]]'' spp.), although numerous other genera such as ''[[Laminaria]]'', ''[[Ecklonia]]'', ''[[Lessonia (alga)|Lessonia]]'', ''[[Alaria (alga)|Alaria]]'', and ''[[Eisenia (alga)|Eisenia]]'' are described.

A wide range of sea life uses kelp forests for protection or food, including fish. In the North Pacific kelp forests, particularly [[Sebastidae|rockfish]], and many [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[amphipod]]s, [[shrimp]], [[marine snail]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[brittle star]]s. Many marine mammals and birds are also found, including seals, sea lions, whales, [[sea otter]]s, gulls, terns, [[snowy egret]]s, [[great blue heron]]s, and cormorants, as well as some shore birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/kelplives.html Kelp forests provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, and birds] NOAA. Updated 11 January 2013. Retrieved 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently considered an [[ecosystem engineer]], kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.G., J. H. Lawton and M. Shachak. 1997. Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers. Ecology 78: 1946-1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In algae (kingdom [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (kingdom [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus.
:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features.
:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose &gt; 50 E m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"&gt;Druehl, L.D. 1981. The distribution of Laminariales in the North Pacific with reference to environmental influences. Proceedings of the International Congress on Systematic Evolution and Biology 2: 248-256.&lt;/ref&gt;). Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"/&gt; Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W.N. 1980. Effect of boundary layer transport on the fixation of carbon by the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera''. Marine Biology 56: 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (''Macrocystis'' spp.) can grow as much as 30–60&amp;nbsp;cm vertically per day. Some species, such as ''Nereocystis'', are [[annual plant|annual]]s, while others such as ''Eisenia'' are [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, living for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Steneck, R.S. and M.N. Dethier. 1994. A functional group approach to the structure of algal-dominated communities. Oikos 69: 476-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;

Kelps are primarily associated with [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] waters worldwide. Of the more dominant genera, ''Laminaria'' is mainly associated with both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the coasts of [[China]] and [[Japan]]; ''Ecklonia'' is found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]; and ''Macrocystis'' occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Southern Ocean]] archipelagos, and in patches around Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; The region with the greatest diversity of kelps (&gt;20 species) is the northeastern Pacific, from north of [[San Francisco, California]], to the [[Aleutian Islands]], Alaska.

Although kelp forests are unknown in tropical surface waters, a few species of ''Laminaria'' have been known to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters.&lt;ref&gt;Joly, A.B. and E.C. Oliveira Filho. 1967. Two Brazilian ''Laminarias''. Instituto de Pesquisas da Marinha 4: 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, J.E., M.V. Suchovejeva and G.V. Avdejev. 1973. New species of the genus ''Laminaria'' from the Philippines Sea. Nov Sistem. Nizch. Rast. 10: 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, [[oligotroph]]ic waters.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions has produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface kelps throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of 200 m. For a hotspot in the [[Galapagos Islands]], the local model was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validated their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide.&lt;ref name="Graham et al. 2007"/&gt; The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, particularly emphasizing the potential for a spatial refuge from climate change also the  explanations to evolutionary patterns of kelps worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Santelices, B. 2007.

[[File:Giantkelp2 300.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giant kelp]] uses gas-filled floats to keep the plant suspended, allowing the kelp blades near the ocean surface to capture light for photosynthesis.]]

The architecture of a kelp forest ecosystem is based on its physical structure, which influences the associated species that define its community structure. Structurally, the ecosystem includes three guilds of kelp and two guilds occupied by other algae:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
*Canopy kelps include the largest species and often constitute floating canopies that extend to the ocean surface (e.g., ''Macrocystis'' and ''Alaria'').
*Stipitate kelps generally extend a few meters above the sea floor and can grow in dense aggregations (e.g., ''Eisenia'' and ''Ecklonia'').
*Prostrate kelps lie near and along the sea floor (e.g., ''Laminaria'').
*The [[benthic]] assemblage is composed of other algal species (e.g., filamentous and foliose functional groups, articulated corallines) and sessile organisms along the ocean bottom.
*Encrusting coralline algae directly and often extensively cover geologic substrate.

Multiple kelp species often co-exist within a forest; the term understory canopy refers to the stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a ''Macrocystis'' canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps ''Eisenia'' and ''Pterygophora'' reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt; Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"&gt;Foster, M.S. and D.R. Schiel. 1985. The ecology of giant kelp forests in California: a community profile. US Fish and Wildlife Service Report 85: 1-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham2004"&gt;Graham, M.H. 2004.

Gillanders, S.D. Connell and A.D. Irving. 2005. Patterns of association between canopy-morphology and understory assemblages across temperate Australia. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]] 63: 133-141.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in California, ''Macrocystis pyrifera'' forests, the [[nudibranch]] ''[[Melibe leonina]]'', and [[skeleton shrimp]] ''Caprella californica'' are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch ''Brachyistius frenatus'', rockfish ''[[Sebastes]]'' spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; [[brittle stars]] and turban snails ''[[Tegula (gastropod)|Tegula]]'' spp. are closely associated with the kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and [[benthic]] fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various [[gastropods]], and [[echinoderms]] live over the encrusting coralline algae.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"/&gt; In addition, [[pelagic fish]]es and [[marine mammals]] are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.

Classic studies in kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic interactions (the relationships between organisms and their [[food webs]]), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally driven by the abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. 1977. Nutrients and production of giant kelp, ''Macrocystis pyrifera'', off southern California. Limnology and Oceanography 22: 979-995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayton1999"&gt;Dayton, P.K. M.J. Tegner, P.B. Edwards and K.L. Riser. 1999. Temporal and spatial scales of kelp demography: the role of the oceanographic climate. Ecological Monographs 69: 219-250.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, M.H. 1994. Effects of macroalgal dynamics on recruitment of a temperate reef fish. Ecology 75: 1320-1333.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests,&lt;ref name="Estes1995"&gt;[[James A. Estes|Estes, J.A.]] and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65: 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sea otters]] (''Enhydra lutris'') control populations of herbivorous [[sea urchins]] through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results in the loss of physical ecosystem structure and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the [[keystone species]] that mediates this [[trophic cascade]]. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the [[California sheephead]]. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins.&lt;ref name="Graham2004"/&gt; However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation.&lt;ref name="Pearse&amp;Hines"&gt;Pearse, J.S. and A.H.

The transition from macroalgal (i.e. kelp forest) to denuded landscapes dominated by sea urchins (or ‘urchin barrens’) is a widespread phenomenon,&lt;ref name ="Steneck 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.M. 1975.

Science 314: 940-941.&lt;/ref&gt; The recovery of kelp forests from barren states has been documented following dramatic perturbations, such as urchin disease or large shifts in thermal conditions.&lt;ref name="Pearse&amp;Hines"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lafferty, K.D. 2004. Fishing for lobsters indirectly increases epidemics in sea urchins. Ecological Applications 14: 1566-1573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasquez"&gt;Vásquez, J.A., J.M. Alonso Vega and A.H. Buschmann. 2006. Long term variability in the structure of kelp communities in northern Chile and the 1997-98 ENSO. Journal of Applied Phycology 18: 505-519.&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery from intermediate states of deterioration is less predictable and depends on a combination of abiotic factors and biotic interactions in each case.

Though urchins are usually the dominant herbivores, others with significant interaction strengths include [[starfish|seastars]], [[isopods]], kelp [[crabs]], and herbivorous fishes.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sala&amp;Graham"/&gt; In many cases, these organisms feed on kelp that has been dislodged from substrate and drifts near the ocean floor rather than expend energy searching for intact thalli on which to feed. When  sufficient drift kelp is available, herbivorous grazers do not exert pressure on attached plants; when drift subsidies are unavailable, grazers directly impact the physical structure of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, R.K. 1983.

== Patch dynamics ==
Another major area of kelp forest research has been directed at understanding the spatial-temporal patterns of kelp patches. Not only do such dynamics affect the physical landscape, but they also affect species that associate with kelp for refuge or foraging activities.&lt;ref name="Foster 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt; Large-scale environmental disturbances have offered important insights concerning mechanisms and ecosystem [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]. Examples of environmental disturbances include:
*Acute and chronic [[pollution]] events have been shown to impact southern California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, R.W. and R.S. Kiwala. 1970. Some ecological effects of discharged wastes on marine life. California Department of Fish and Game 56: 145-155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stull, J.K. 1989. Contaminants in sediments near a major marine outfall: history, effects and future. OCEANS ’89 Proceedings 2: 481-484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North, W.J., D.E. James and L.G. Jones. 1993. History of kelp beds (''Macrocystis'') in Orange and San Diego Counties, California. Hydrobiologia 260/261: 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegner, M.J., P.K. Dayton, P.B. Edwards, K.L. Riser, D.B. Chadwick, T.A. Dean and L. Deysher. 1995. Effects of a large sewage spill on a kelp forest community: catastrophe or disturbance? Marine Environmental Research 40: 181-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.R., R.F. Caraco, D.F. Cornell, R.W. Howarth, A.N. Sharpley and V.N. Smith. 1998. Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen. Ecological Applications 8: 559-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution can include sediment deposition and [[eutrophication]] from sewage, industrial byproducts and contaminants like [[PCBs]] and heavy metals (for example, copper, zinc), runoff of [[organophosphates]] from agricultural areas, anti-fouling chemicals used in harbors and marinas (for example, [[Tributyltin|TBT]] and [[creosote]]) and land-based pathogens like [[fecal coliform bacteria]].
*Catastrophic storms can remove surface kelp canopies through wave activity, but usually leave understory kelps intact; they can also remove urchins when little spatial refuge is available.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebeling"/&gt; Interspersed canopy clearings create a seascape mosaic where sunlight penetrates deeper into the kelp forest and species that are normally light-limited in the understory can flourish. Similarly, substrate cleared of kelp holdfasts can provide space for other sessile species to establish themselves and occupy the seafloor, sometimes directly competing with juvenile kelp and even inhibiting their settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Kennelly, S.J. 1987. Physical disturbances in an Australian kelp community. I. Temporal effects. Marine Ecology Progress Series 40: 145-153.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events involve the depression of oceanographic thermoclines, severe reductions of nutrient input, and changes in storm patterns.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPhaden, M.J. 1999. Genesis and evolution of the 1997-1998 El Niño. Science 283: 950-954.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress due to warm water and nutrient depletion can increase the susceptibility of kelp to storm damage and herbivorous grazing, sometimes even prompting phase shifts to urchin-dominated landscapes.&lt;ref name="Vasquez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayton 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, M.S. and G. Hernández-Carmona. 2005. Delayed recovery of giant kelp near its southern range limit in the North Pacific following El Niño. Marine Biology 147: 273-279.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, oceanographic conditions (that is, water temperature, currents) influence the recruitment success of kelp and its competitors, which clearly affect subsequent species interactions and kelp forest dynamics.&lt;ref name="Dayton1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duggins, D.O., J.E. Eckman and A.T. Sewell. 1990. Ecology of understory kelp environments. II. Effects of kelps on recruitment of benthic invertebrates. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 143: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Overfishing higher trophic levels that naturally regulate herbivore populations is also recognized as an important stressor in kelp forests.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halpern2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2001"&gt;Jackson, J.B.C, M.X. Kirby, W.H. Berger, K.A. Bjorndal, L.W. Botsford, B.J. Bourque, R.H. Bradbury, R. Cooke, J. [[Jon Erlandson|Erlandson]], [[James A. Estes|J.A. Estes]], T.P. Hughes, S. Kidwell, C.B. Lange, H.S. Lenihan, J.M. Pandolfi, C.H. Peterson, R.S. Steneck, M.J. Tegner and R.R. Warner. 2002. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629-638.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the previous section, the drivers and outcomes of trophic cascades are important for understanding spatial-temporal patterns of kelp forests.&lt;ref name="Estes1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearse&amp;Hines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sala&amp;Graham"/&gt;

In addition to ecological monitoring of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart the intricacies of kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, they can control for the presence or absence of specific biotic and abiotic factors to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of ''Ecklonia radiata'' in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of ''E. radiata'' can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, A.D. and S.D. Connell. 2006. Predicting understory structure from the presence and composition of canopies: an assembly rule for marine algae. [[Oecologia]] 148: 491-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human use ==
Kelp forests have been important to human existence for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Simenstad, C.A., [[James A. Estes|J.A. Estes]] and K.W. Kenyon. 1978. Aleuts, sea otters, and alternate stable-state communities. Science 200: 403-411.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many now theorise that the first colonisation of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests during the last ice age. One theory contends that the kelp forests that would have stretched from northeast Asia to the American Pacific coast would have provided many benefits to ancient boaters. The kelp forests would have provided many sustenance opportunities, as well as acting as a type of buffer from rough water. Besides these benefits, researchers believe that the kelp forests might have helped early boaters navigate, acting as a type of "kelp highway". Theorists also suggest that the kelp forests would have helped these ancient colonists by providing a stable way of life and preventing them from having to adapt to new ecosystems and develop new survival methods even as they traveled thousands of miles.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle [http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/20-did-humans-colonize-the-world-by-boat/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C=. ''Did Humans Colonize the World by Boat?'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern economies are based on [[fisheries]] of kelp-associated species such as  [[lobster]] and rockfish. Humans can also harvest kelp directly to feed aquaculture species such as  abalone and to extract the compound [[alginic acid]], which is used in products like toothpaste and antacids.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez, A., T. Correa, V. Muñoz, A. Santibañez, R. Marcos, C. Cáceres and A.H. Buschmann. 2006. Farming of the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera'' in southern Chile for development of novel food products. Journal of Applied Phycology 18: 259-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, M. and W. Stotz. 2007. Ecological and eco-social models for the introduction of the abalone ''Haliotis discus hannai'' into benthic systems of north-central Chile: sustainability assessment. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 17: 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelp forests are valued for recreational activities such as SCUBA diving and kayaking; the industries that support these sports represent one benefit related to the ecosystem and the enjoyment derived from these activities represents another. All of these are examples of [[ecosystem services]] provided specifically by kelp forests.

== Threats and management ==

Given the complexity of kelp forests – their variable structure, geography, and interactions – they pose a considerable challenge to environmental managers. Extrapolating even well-studied trends to the future is difficult because interactions within the ecosystem will change under variable conditions, not all relationships in the ecosystem are understood, and the nonlinear thresholds to transitions are not yet recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer, M., S. Carpenter, J.A. Foley, C. Folke and B. Walter. 2001. Catastrophic shifts in ecosystems. Nature 413: 591-596.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to kelp forests, major issues of concern include marine pollution and [[water quality]], kelp harvesting and fisheries, [[invasive species]], and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"/&gt; The most pressing threat to kelp forest preservation may be the overfishing of coastal ecosystems, which by removing higher trophic levels facilitates their shift to depauperate urchin barrens.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"/&gt; The maintenance of [[biodiversity]] is recognized as a way of generally stabilizing ecosystems and their services through mechanisms such as functional compensation and reduced susceptibility to foreign species invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, T.M., S.R.

In many places, managers have opted to regulate the harvest of kelp&lt;ref name="Dayton1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stekoll, M.S., L.E. Deysher and M. Hess. 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7043">This is an incomplete list of [[plants]] with trifoliate leaves. '''Trifoliate''' leaves (also known as '''trifoliolate''' or '''ternate''' leaves) are a [[leaf shape]] characterized by a leaf divided into three leaflets. Species which are known to be trifoliate are listed here. Genera which are characteristically trifoliate are also listed, with species underneath. Genera which are generally ''not'' trifoliate are not listed; only the trifoliate species are. Entries are currently listed in alphabetical order, but in the future it may be desirable to list them by families. It may also be desirable to include common names and references.

It is an essential mineral [[nutrient]] (i.e., element) for life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnesium (In Biological Systems)|journal=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia|date=2006|doi=10.1002/0471743984.vse4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leroy 1926"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Leroy| first=J.| year=1926| title=Necessite du magnesium pour la croissance de la souris| journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société de Biologie| volume=94| pages= 431–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lusk 1968"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lusk| first=J.E.|author2=Williams, R.J.P. |author3=Kennedy, E.P. | year=1968| title=Magnesium and the growth of Escherichia coli| journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume=243| pages=2618–2624| pmid=4968384| issue=10 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/243/10/2618.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Marschner| first= H.| year=1995| title=Mineral Nutrition in Higher Plants| location=San Diego| publisher= Academic Press| isbn=0-12-473542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is present in every [[cell (biology)|cell]] type in every organism. For example, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must bind to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP.&lt;ref name="cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225194451/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?magnesium|title=Definition: magnesium from Online Medical Dictionary|date=25 December 2007|website=Archive.org|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, magnesium plays a role in the stability of all [[polyphosphate]] compounds in the cells, including those associated with the synthesis of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

Over 300 [[enzyme]]s require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including ''all'' enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other [[nucleotide]]s to synthesize DNA and RNA. [cite needed]

In plants, magnesium is necessary for synthesis of [[chlorophyll]] and [[photosynthesis]].

==Function==
A balance of magnesium is vital to the well-being of all organisms. Magnesium is a relatively abundant ion in Earth's crust and mantle and is highly bioavailable in the [[hydrosphere]].  This availability, in combination with a useful and very unusual chemistry, may have led to its utilization in evolution as an ion for signaling, enzyme activation, and [[catalysis]].  However, the unusual nature of ionic magnesium has also led to a major challenge in the use of the ion in biological systems.  Biological membranes are impermeable to magnesium (and other ions), so transport proteins must facilitate the flow of magnesium, both into and out of cells and intracellular compartments.

Chlorophyll in plants converts water to oxygen as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  [[Hemoglobin]] in vertebrate animals transports oxygen as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the blood. Chlorophyll is very similar to hemoglobin, except magnesium is at the center of the chlorophyll molecule and iron is at the center of the hemoglobin molecule, with other variations.&lt;ref&gt;Granick S, Evolution of Heme and Chlorophyll in book, Bryson V, HJ Vogel, ed., Evolving Genes and Proteins.  Academic Press, NY and London, 1965, pp. 67-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process keeps living cells on earth alive and maintains baseline levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in our atmosphere.

{{Further|Magnesium deficiency}}

Inadequate magnesium intake frequently causes muscle [[spasm]]s, and has been associated with [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[anxiety]] disorders, [[migraine]]s, [[osteoporosis]], and [[cerebral infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;

The most common symptom of excess oral magnesium intake is [[diarrhea]]. Supplements based on [[amino acid]] [[chelates]] (such as [[glycinate]], [[lysinate]] etc.) are much better-tolerated by the [[digestive system]] and do not have the [[side-effects]] of the older compounds used, while [[sustained-release]] [[dietary supplements]] prevent the occurrence of diarrhea.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Since the kidneys of adult humans excrete excess magnesium efficiently, oral magnesium poisoning in adults with normal [[renal function]] is very rare. Infants, which have less ability to excrete excess magnesium even when healthy, should not be given magnesium supplements, except under a physician's care.

[[Magnesium (pharmaceutical preparation)|Pharmaceutical preparations with magnesium]] are used to treat conditions including [[magnesium deficiency (medicine)|magnesium deficiency]] and [[hypomagnesemia]], as well as [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=Euser2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Euser | first1 = A.

Magnesium is absorbed with reasonable efficiency (30% to 40%) by the body from any soluble magnesium salt, such as the chloride or citrate. Magnesium is similarly absorbed from [[Epsom salts]], although the sulfate in these salts adds to their laxative effect at higher doses. Magnesium absorption from the insoluble oxide and hydroxide salts ([[milk of magnesia]]) is erratic and of poorer efficiency, since it depends on the neutralization and solution of the salt by the acid of the stomach, which may not be (and usually is not) complete.

====Nerve conduction====
Magnesium can affect muscle relaxation through direct action on cell membranes.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and [[Recommended Dietary Allowances]] (RDAs) for magnesium in 1997. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EARs for magnesium for women and men ages 31 and up are 265&amp;nbsp;mg/day and 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 320 and 420&amp;nbsp;mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 350 to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/day depending on age of the woman. RDA for lactation ranges 310 to 360&amp;nbsp;mg/day for same reason. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 65 to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of magnesium the UL is set at 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The UL is specific to magnesium consumed as a dietary supplement, the reason being that too much magnesium consumed at one time can cause diarrhea. The UL does not apply to food-sourced magnasium. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK109816/ "Magnesium"], pp.190-249 in "Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride". National Academy Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 300 and 350&amp;nbsp;mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation are also 300&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 170 to 250&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 250&amp;nbsp;mg/day - lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnesium UL is unique in that it is lower than some of the RDAs. It applies to intake from a pharmacological agent or dietary supplement only, and does not include intake from food and water.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value (%DV). For magnesium labeling purposes 100% of the daily value was 400&amp;nbsp;mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 420&amp;nbsp;mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition - Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.FDA.gov|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food sources ==
[[Image:FoodSourcesOfMagnesium.jpg|upright|thumb|Some good sources of magnesium]]
[[Green vegetable]]s such as [[spinach]] provide magnesium because of the abundance of [[chlorophyll]] molecules, which contain the ion. [[Nut (fruit)|Nut]]s (especially [[Brazil nut]]s, [[cashew]]s and [[almond]]s), [[seed]]s (e.g., [[pumpkin seed]]s), [[dark chocolate]], roasted [[soybean]]s, [[bran]], and some [[whole grain]]s are also good sources of magnesium.&lt;ref name="foods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/foods-high-in-magnesium.php|title=Top 10 Foods Highest in Magnesium + Printable One Page Sheet|website=HealthAliciousNess|access-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many foods contain magnesium, it is usually found in low levels. As with most nutrients, daily needs for magnesium are unlikely to be met by one serving of any single food. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains will help ensure adequate intake of magnesium.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Because magnesium readily dissolves in water, refined foods, which are often processed or cooked in water and dried, in general, are poor sources of the nutrient. For example, [[whole-wheat bread]] has twice as much magnesium as white bread because the magnesium-rich germ and bran are removed when white flour is processed. The table of food sources of magnesium suggests many dietary sources of magnesium.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Hard water|"Hard" water]] can also provide magnesium, but [[Soft water|"soft" water]] contains less of the ion. Dietary surveys do not assess magnesium intake from water, which may lead to underestimating total magnesium intake and its variability.

Too much magnesium may make it difficult for the body to absorb [[calcium]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Not enough magnesium can lead to [[hypomagnesemia]] as described above, with irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure (a sign in humans but not some experimental animals such as rodents), insomnia, and muscle spasms ([[fasciculation]]).  However, as noted, symptoms of low magnesium from pure dietary deficiency are thought to be rarely encountered.

Magnesium is very important in cellular function.  Deficiency of the [[nutrient]] causes disease of the affected organism. In single-cell organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]], low levels of magnesium manifests in greatly reduced growth rates.

Plants deficient in magnesium show stress responses. The first observable signs of both magnesium starvation and overexposure in plants is a decrease in the rate of [[photosynthesis]].

In animals, magnesium deficiency ([[hypomagnesemia]]) is seen when the environmental availability of magnesium is low. In ruminant animals, particularly vulnerable to magnesium availability in pasture grasses, the condition is known as ‘grass tetany’. Hypomagnesemia is identified by a loss of balance due to muscle weakness.&lt;ref name="Grunes 1970"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Grunes| first= D. L.|author2=Stout, P.

Overexposure to magnesium may be toxic to individual cells, though these effects have been difficult to show experimentally.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} [[Hypermagnesemia]], an overabundance of magnesium in the blood, is usually caused by loss of [[kidney]] function. Healthy animals rapidly excrete excess magnesium in the urine and stool.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, Online Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary magnesium is called ''magnesuria''. Characteristic concentrations of magnesium in model organisms are: in ''E. coli'' 30-100mM (bound), 0.01-1mM (free), in budding yeast 50mM, in mammalian cell 10mM (bound), 0.5mM (free) and in blood plasma 1mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-concentrations-of-different-ions-in-cells/|title =Cell Biology by the Numbers: What are the concentrations of different ions in cells? |website =book.bionumbers.org|first1= Ron|last1= Milo|first2= Rob |last2=Philips|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological chemistry==
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the fourth-most-abundant [[metal]] [[ion]] in cells (per [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s) and the most abundant free divalent cation — as a result, it is deeply and intrinsically woven into cellular [[metabolism]]. Indeed, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [[enzyme]]s appear in virtually every metabolic pathway: Specific binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to biological membranes is frequently observed, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also used as a signalling molecule, and much of nucleic acid biochemistry requires Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, including all reactions that require release of energy from ATP.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Cowan| first= J.

===Chlorophyll===

In photosynthetic organisms, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has the additional vital role of being the [[Coordination complex|coordinating ion]] in the [[chlorophyll]] molecule. This role was discovered by [[Richard Willstätter]], who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1915 for the purification and structure of chlorophyll.

===Enzymes===

The chemistry of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, as applied to enzymes, uses the full range of this ion’s unusual reaction chemistry to fulfill a range of functions.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black 1995a"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Black| first= C.

In general, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interacts with substrates through inner sphere coordination, stabilising anions or reactive intermediates, also including binding to ATP and activating the molecule to nucleophilic attack. When interacting with enzymes and other proteins, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may bind using inner or outer sphere coordination, to either alter the conformation of the enzyme or take part in the chemistry of the catalytic reaction. In either case, because Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only rarely fully dehydrated during ligand binding, it may be a water molecule associated with the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that is important rather than the ion itself. The [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acidity]] of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] 11.4) is used to allow both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (most common ones being phosphate ester hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer) that would otherwise require pH values greatly removed from physiological values.

=== Essential role in the biological activity of ATP ===
[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must be bound to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP.&lt;ref name="cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Nucleic acids===

[[Nucleic acid]]s have an important range of interactions with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] stabilises structure; this can be observed in the increased melting temperature (''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of double-stranded DNA in the presence of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; In addition, [[ribosome]]s contain large amounts of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the stabilisation provided is essential to the complexation of this ribo-protein.&lt;ref name="Sperazza 1983"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sperazza| first= J.

Finally, the autocatalysis of many [[ribozymes]] (enzymes containing only RNA) is Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent (e.g. the yeast mitochondrial group II self splicing introns&lt;ref name="Smith 1995"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Smith| first= R. L.|author2=Thompson, L.J. |author3=Maguire, M. E. | year=1995| title= Cloning and characterization of MgtE, a putative new class of Mg2+ transporter from Bacillus firmus OF4| journal= Journal of Bacteriology| volume= 177| pages= 1233–1238| pmid=7868596| issue=5| pmc=176728}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Magnesium ions can be critical in maintaining the positional integrity of closely clustered phosphate groups. These clusters appear in numerous and distinct parts of the [[cell nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]]. For instance, hexahydrated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions bind in the deep [[DNA|major groove]] and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid [[Nucleic acid double helix|duplexes]].&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/28/8/1760/1009217|title=Hexahydrated magnesium ions bind in the deep major groove and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid duplexes|first1=Howard|last1=Robinson|first2=Yi-Gui|last2=Gao|first3=Ruslan|last3=Sanishvili|first4=Andrzej|last4=Joachimiak|first5=Andrew H.-J.|last5=Wang|date=15 April 2000|publisher=|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1760–1766|access-date=17 January 2018|via=nar.OxfordJournals.org|doi=10.1093/nar/28.8.1760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell membranes and walls===

Biological [[cell membrane]]s and [[cell wall]]s are polyanionic surfaces. This has important implications for the transport of ions, in particular because it has been shown that different membranes preferentially bind different ions.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; Both Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regularly stabilize membranes by the cross-linking of [[Carboxylation|carboxylated]] and [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] head groups of lipids. However, the envelope membrane of ''[[E. coli]]'' has also been shown to bind Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The transport of ions is dependent on both the concentration gradient of the ion and the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the membrane, which will be affected by the charge on the membrane surface. For example, the specific binding of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to the [[chloroplast]] envelope has been implicated in a loss of photosynthetic efficiency by the blockage of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake and the subsequent acidification of the chloroplast stroma.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz 1993"/&gt;

===Proteins===

The Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion tends to bind only weakly to [[protein]]s ([[Acid dissociation constant|''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] ≤ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt;) and this can be exploited by the cell to switch [[enzymatic]] activity on and off by changes in the local concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Although the concentration of free cytoplasmic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, the total Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; content of animal cells is 30&amp;nbsp;mmol/L&lt;ref name="Ebel 1980"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ebel| first= H.|author2=Gunther, T. | year= 1980| title= Magnesium metabolism: a review| journal= Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry| volume= 18| pages= 257–270| doi=10.1515/cclm.1980.18.5.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in plants the content of leaf endodermal cells has been measured at values as high as 100&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990), much of which buffered in storage compartments. The cytoplasmic concentration of free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is buffered by binding to [[Chelation|chelators]] (e.g., ATP), but also, what is more important, by storage of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in intracellular compartments. The transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; between intracellular compartments may be a major part of regulating enzyme activity. The interaction of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with proteins must also be considered for the transport of the ion across biological membranes.

===Manganese===

In biological systems, only [[manganese]] (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is readily capable of replacing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but only in a limited set of circumstances. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is very similar to Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in terms of its chemical properties, including inner and outer shell complexation. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; effectively binds ATP and allows hydrolysis of the energy molecule by most ATPases. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can also replace Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as the activating ion for a number of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent enzymes, although some enzyme activity is usually lost.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"/&gt; Sometimes such enzyme metal preferences vary among closely related species: For example, the [[reverse transcriptase]] enzyme of [[lentivirus]]es like [[HIV]], [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] and [[FIV]] is typically dependent on Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the analogous enzyme for other [[retrovirus]]es prefers Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Importance in drug binding ===
An article&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35101544|year=2001|last1=Schlünzen|first1=Frank|last2=Zarivach|first2=Raz|last3=Harms|first3=Jörg|last4=Bashan|first4=Anat|last5=Tocilj|first5=Ante|last6=Albrecht|first6=Renate|last7=Yonath|first7=Ada|last8=Franceschi|first8=François|journal=Nature|volume=413|issue=6858|pages=814–21|pmid=11677599|title=Structural basis for the interaction of antibiotics with the peptidyl transferase centre in eubacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating the structural basis of interactions between clinically relevant antibiotics and the 50S ribosome appeared in Nature in October 2001. High-resolution X-ray crystallography established that these antibiotics associate only with the 23S rRNA of a ribosomal subunit, and no interactions are formed with a subunit's protein portion. The article stresses that the results show "the importance of putative Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions for the binding of some drugs".

==Measuring magnesium in biological samples==

===By radioactive isotopes===
The use of radioactive tracer elements in ion uptake assays allows the calculation of km, Ki and Vmax and determines the initial change in the ion content of the cells. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg decays by the emission of a high-energy beta or gamma particle, which can be measured using a scintillation counter. However, the radioactive half-life of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, the most stable of the radioactive magnesium isotopes, is only 21 hours. This severely restricts the experiments involving the nuclide. Also, since 1990, no facility has routinely produced &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, and the price per mCi is now predicted to be approximately US$30,000.&lt;ref name="Maguire 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maguire| first= M.E.|author2=Cowan, J.

The difficulty of using metal ion replacement in the study of enzyme function is that the relationship between the enzyme activities with the replacement ion compared to the original is very difficult to ascertain.&lt;ref name="Tevelev 1995"/&gt;

===By fluorescent indicators===
A number of chelators of divalent cations have different fluorescence spectra in the bound and unbound states.&lt;ref name="Drakenberg 1995"&gt;{{cite book| last=Drakenberg| first= T. | year= 1995| title= Physical methods for studying the biological chemistry of magnesium| work= The Biological Chemistry of Magnesium| editor=J.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelators lag behind and the major fluorescence dye for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (mag-fura 2&lt;ref name="Raju 1989"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Raju| first= B.|author2=Murphy, E. |author3=Levy, L.

Recently, Otten ''et al.'' (2001) have described work into a new class of compounds that may prove more useful, having significantly better binding affinities for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Otten 2001"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Otten| first= P.A.|author2=London, R.E. |author3=Levy, L.

If the ion concentration is buffered by the cell by chelation or removal to subcellular compartments, the measured rate of uptake will give only minimum values of km and Vmax.

===By electrophysiology===
First, ion-specific microelectrodes can be used to measure the internal free ion concentration of cells and organelles. The major advantages are that readings can be made from cells over relatively long periods of time, and that unlike dyes very little extra ion buffering capacity is added to the cells.&lt;ref name="Gunzel 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gunzel| first= D.|author2=Schlue, W.-R. | year= 2002| title= Determination of [Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]i - an update on the use of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective electrodes| journal=BioMetals| volume= 15| pages= 237–249| doi=10.1023/A:1016074714951| pmid=12206390| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the technique of two-electrode voltage-clamp allows the direct measurement of the ion flux across the membrane of a cell.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch2"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hille| first= B. | year=1992| title= Ionic channels of excitable membranes| location=Sunderland| publisher= Sinauer Associates Inc.| chapter=2| isbn=0-87893-322-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is held at an electric potential and the responding current is measured. All ions passing across the membrane contribute to the measured current.

Third, the technique of patch-clamp uses isolated sections of natural or artificial membrane in much the same manner as voltage-clamp but without the secondary effects of a cellular system. Under ideal conditions the conductance of individual channels can be quantified. This methodology gives the most direct measurement of the action of ion channels.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch2"/&gt;

===By absorption spectroscopy===
Flame [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS) determines the total magnesium content of a biological sample.&lt;ref name="Drakenberg 1995"/&gt; This method is destructive; biological samples must be broken down in concentrated acids to avoid clogging the fine nebulising apparatus. Beyond this, the only limitation is that samples must be in a volume of approximately 2 mL and at a concentration range of 0.1 – 0.4 µmol/L for optimum accuracy. As this technique cannot distinguish between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; already present in the cell and that taken up during the experiment, only content not uptaken can be quantified.

[[Inductively coupled plasma]] (ICP) using either the [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) or [[atomic emission spectroscopy]] (AES) modifications also allows the determination of the total ion content of biological samples.&lt;ref name="Dean 1997"&gt;See Chapters 5 and 6 in  {{cite book| last=Dean| first= J.R. | year= 1997| title= Atomic Absorption and Plasma Spectroscopy| location=Chichester| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn=0-471-97255-X}} for descriptions of the methodology as applied to analytical chemistry.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are more sensitive than flame AAS and are capable of measuring the quantities of multiple ions simultaneously. However, they are also significantly more expensive.

==Magnesium transport==
{{main|Magnesium transport}}

The chemical and biochemical properties of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; present the cellular system with a significant challenge when transporting the ion across biological membranes. The dogma of ion transport states that the transporter recognises the ion then progressively removes the water of hydration, removing most or all of the water at a selective pore before releasing the ion on the far side of the membrane.&lt;ref name="Hille 1992 ch11"&gt;Hille, 1992. Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the properties of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, large volume change from hydrated to bare ion, high energy of hydration and very low rate of ligand exchange in the inner [[coordination sphere]], these steps are probably more difficult than for most other ions. To date, only the ZntA protein of Paramecium has been shown to be a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Haynes| first= W. J.|author2=Kung, C. |author3=Saimi, Y. |author4=Preston, R. R. | year=2002| title= An exchanger-like protein underlies the large Mg2+ current in Paramecium| journal= PNAS| volume= 99| pages= 15717–15722| doi=10.1073/pnas.242603999| pmid=12422021| issue=24| pmc=137782}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport by the remaining proteins are beginning to be uncovered with the first three-dimensional structure of a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport complex being solved in 2004.&lt;ref name="Warren 2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Warren| first= M. A. |author2=Kucharski, L. M. |author3=Veenstra, A. |author4=Shi, L. |author5=Grulich, P. F. |author6=Maguire, M.

The [[hydration shell]] of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a very tightly bound inner shell of six water molecules and a relatively tightly bound second shell containing 12–14 water molecules (Markham ''et al.'', 2002). Thus, it is presumed that recognition of the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion requires some mechanism to interact initially with the hydration shell of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by a direct recognition/binding of the ion to the protein.&lt;ref name="Maguire 2002"/&gt; Due to the strength of the inner sphere complexation between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and any ligand, multiple simultaneous interactions with the transport protein at this level might significantly retard the ion in the transport pore. Hence, it is possible that much of the hydration water is retained during transport, allowing the weaker (but still specific) outer sphere coordination.

In spite of the mechanistic difficulty, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; must be transported across membranes, and a large number of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes across membranes from a variety of systems have been described.&lt;ref name="Gardner 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gardner| first= R. C. | year= 2003| title= Genes for magnesium transport| journal= Current Opinion in Plant Biology| volume= 6| pages= 263–267| doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(03)00032-3| pmid=12753976| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small selection of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters have been characterised at the molecular level.

=== Ligand ion channel blockade ===
[[Magnesium]] [[ion]]s (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[cellular biology]] are usually in almost all senses opposite to [[calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions, because they are [[Bivalent (chemistry)|bivalent]] too, but have greater [[electronegativity]] and thus exert greater pull on water molecules, preventing passage through the channel (even though the magnesium itself is smaller). Thus, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions block Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as ([[NMDA channel]]s) and have been shown to affect gap junction channels forming [[electrical synapse]]s.

==Plant physiology of magnesium==
The previous sections have dealt in detail with the chemical and biochemical aspects of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and its transport across cellular membranes. This section will apply this knowledge to aspects of whole plant physiology, in an attempt to show how these processes interact with the larger and more complex environment of the multicellular organism.

===Nutritional requirements and interactions===
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for plant growth and is present in higher plants in amounts on the order of 80 μmol g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; The amounts of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; vary in different parts of the plant and are dependent upon nutritional status. In times of plenty, excess Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be stored in vascular cells (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990;&lt;ref name="Shaul 1999"/&gt; and in times of starvation Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is redistributed, in many plants, from older to newer leaves.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Laing| first= W.|author2=Greer, D. |author3=Sun, O. |author4=Beets, P. |author5=Lowe, A. |author6=Payn, T.  | year=2000| title= Physiological impacts of Mg deficiency in Pinus radiata: growth and photosynthesis| journal= New Phytol| volume= 146| pages= 47–57| doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00616.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is taken up into plants via the roots. Interactions with other cations in the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]] can have a significant effect on the uptake of the ion.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980;&lt;ref name="Heenan 1981"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Heenan| first= D.P.|author2=Campbell, L.C. | year=1981| title= Influence of potassium and manganese on growth and uptake of magnesium by soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv Bragg| journal=Plant Soil| volume= 61| pages= 447–456| doi=10.1007/BF02182025| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of root cell walls is highly permeable to water and ions, and hence ion uptake into root cells can occur anywhere from the root hairs to cells located almost in the centre of the root (limited only by the [[Casparian strip]]). Plant cell walls and membranes carry a great number of negative charges, and the interactions of cations with these charges is key to the uptake of cations by root cells allowing a local concentrating effect.&lt;ref name="Hope 1952"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hope| first= A. B.|author2=Stevens, P. G. | year=1952| title= Electrical potential differences in bean roots on their relation to salt uptake| journal= Australian Journal of Scientific Research, Series B| volume= 5| pages= 335–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binds relatively weakly to these charges, and can be displaced by other cations, impeding uptake and causing deficiency in the plant.

Within individual plant cells, the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; requirements are largely the same as for all cellular life; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is used to stabilise membranes, is vital to the utilisation of ATP, is extensively involved in the nucleic acid biochemistry, and is a cofactor for many enzymes (including the ribosome). Also, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. It is the intracellular compartmentalisation of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in plant cells that leads to additional complexity. Four compartments within the plant cell have reported interactions with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Initially, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; will enter the cell into the cytoplasm (by an as yet unidentified system), but free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations in this compartment are tightly regulated at relatively low levels (≈2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) and so any excess Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is either quickly exported or stored in the second intracellular compartment, the vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8.5.2 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mitochondria has been demonstrated in yeast&lt;ref name="Bui 1999"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bui| first= D.M.|author2=Gregan, J. |author3=Jarosch, E. |author4=Ragnini, A. |author5=Schweyen, R.

===Distributing magnesium ions within the plant===
Once in the cytoplasmic space of root cells Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, along with the other cations, is probably transported radially into the stele and the vascular tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.7 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; From the cells surrounding the xylem the ions are released or pumped into the xylem and carried up through the plant. In the case of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem,&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the ions will be transported to the top of the plant and back down again in a continuous cycle of replenishment. Hence, uptake and release from vascular cells is probably a key part of whole plant Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Figure 1 shows how few processes have been connected to their molecular mechanisms (only vacuolar uptake has been associated with a transport protein, AtMHX).

The diagram shows a schematic of a plant and the putative processes of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport at the root and leaf where Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is loaded and unloaded from the vascular tissues.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is taken up into the root cell wall space (1) and interacts with the negative charges associated with the cell walls and membranes. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be taken up into cells immediately (symplastic pathway) or may travel as far as the Casparian band (4) before being absorbed into cells (apoplastic pathway; 2). The concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the root cells is probably buffered by storage in root cell vacuoles (3). Note that cells in the root tip do not contain vacuoles. Once in the root cell cytoplasm, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; travels toward the centre of the root by [[plasmodesmata]], where it is loaded into the xylem (5) for transport to the upper parts of the plant. When the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reaches the leaves it is unloaded from the xylem into cells (6) and again is buffered in vacuoles (7). Whether cycling of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the phloem occurs via general cells in the leaf (8) or directly from xylem to phloem via [[transfer cells]] (9) is unknown. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may return to the roots in the phloem sap.

[[Image:whole plant mg transport.png|frame|center|Figure 1: Magnesium in the whole plant]]
When a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has been absorbed by a cell requiring it for metabolic processes, it is generally assumed that the ion stays in that cell for as long as the cell is active.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; In vascular cells, this is not always the case; in times of plenty, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is stored in the vacuole, takes no part in the day-to-day metabolic processes of the cell (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990), and is released at need. But for most cells it is death by senescence or injury that releases Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and many of the other ionic constituents, recycling them into healthy parts of the plant. In addition, when Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the environment is limiting, some species are able to mobilise Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from older tissues.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt; These processes involve the release of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from its bound and stored states and its transport back into the vascular tissue, where it can be distributed to the rest of the plant. In times of growth and development, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also remobilised within the plant as source and sink relationships change.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;

The homeostasis of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within single plant cells is maintained by processes occurring at the plasma membrane and at the vacuole membrane (see Figure 2). The major driving force for the translocation of ions in plant cells is ΔpH.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.4 in Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proton ATPase|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] pump H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions against their concentration gradient to maintain the pH differential that can be used for the transport of other ions and molecules. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are pumped out of the cytoplasm into the extracellular space or into the vacuole. The entry of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into cells may occur through one of two pathways, via channels using the ΔΨ (negative inside) across this membrane or by [[Symporter|symport]] with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. To transport the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion into the vacuole requires a Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Antiporter|antiport]] transporter (such as AtMHX). The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases are dependent on Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (bound to ATP) for activity, so that Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is required to maintain its own homeostasis.

A schematic of a plant cell is shown including the four major compartments currently recognised as interacting with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Proton ATPase|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases]] maintain a constant ΔpH across the plasma membrane and the vacuole membrane. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is transported into the vacuole using the energy of ΔpH (in ''A. thaliana'' by AtMHX). Transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into cells may use either the negative ΔΨ or the ΔpH. The transport of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into mitochondria probably uses ΔΨ as in the mitochondria of yeast, and it is likely that [[chloroplast]]s take Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by a similar system. The mechanism and the molecular basis for the release of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from vacuoles and from the cell is not known. Likewise, the light-regulated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration changes in chloroplasts are not fully understood, but do require the transport of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the [[thylakoid]] membrane.

===Magnesium, chloroplasts and photosynthesis===
Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the coordinating metal ion in the chlorophyll molecule, and in plants where the ion is in high supply about 6% of the total Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is bound to chlorophyll.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott 1990a"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Scott| first= B.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is probably taken up into chloroplasts to the greatest extent during the light-induced development from proplastid to chloroplast or etioplast to chloroplast. At these times, the synthesis of chlorophyll and the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane stacks absolutely require the divalent cation.&lt;ref name="Gregory 1989"&gt;{{cite book| last=Gregory| first= R.

Whether Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is able to move into and out of chloroplasts after this initial developmental phase has been the subject of several conflicting reports. Deshaies ''et al.''

The relative proportion of immature chloroplasts present in the preparations may explain these observations.

The metabolic state of the chloroplast changes considerably between night and day. During the day, the chloroplast is actively harvesting the energy of light and converting it into chemical energy. The activation of the metabolic pathways involved comes from the changes in the chemical nature of the stroma on the addition of light. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is pumped out of the stroma (into both the cytoplasm and the lumen) leading to an alkaline pH.&lt;ref name="Heldt 1973"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Heldt| first= H.W.|author2=Werdan, K. |author3=Milovancev, M. |author4=Geller, G. | year=1973| title= Alkalization of the chloroplast stroma caused by light-dependent proton flux into the thylakoid space| journal= Biochimica et Biophysica Acta| volume= 314| pages= 224–241| doi=10.1016/0005-2728(73)90137-0| pmid=4747067| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hind 1974"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hind| first= G.|author2=Nakatani, H.

Two major classes of the enzymes that interact with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the stroma during the light phase can be identified.&lt;ref name="Black 1995b"/&gt; Firstly, enzymes in the glycolytic pathway most often interact with two atoms of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The first atom is as an allosteric modulator of the enzymes’ activity, while the second forms part of the active site and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The second class of enzymes includes those where the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is complexed to nucleotide di- and tri-phosphates (ADP and ATP), and the chemical change involves phosphoryl transfer. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may also serve in a structural maintenance role in these enzymes (e.g., enolase).

===Magnesium stress===
{{Main|magnesium deficiency (agriculture)}}
Plant stress responses can be observed in plants that are under- or over-supplied with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The first observable signs of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stress in plants for both starvation and toxicity is a depression of the rate of photosynthesis, it is presumed because of the strong relationships between Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and chloroplasts/chlorophyll. In pine trees, even before the visible appearance of yellowing and necrotic spots, the photosynthetic efficiency of the needles drops markedly.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt; In Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency, reported secondary effects include carbohydrate immobility, loss of RNA transcription and loss of protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8.5.6 of Marschner, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the mobility of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the plant, the deficiency phenotype may be present only in the older parts of the plant. For example, in Pinus radiata starved of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, one of the earliest identifying signs is the [[chlorosis]] in the needles on the lower branches of the tree. This is because Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has been recovered from these tissues and moved to growing (green) needles higher in the tree.&lt;ref name="Laing 2000"/&gt;

A Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficit can be caused by the lack of the ion in the media (soil), but more commonly comes from inhibition of its uptake.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binds quite weakly to the negatively charged groups in the root cell walls, so that excesses of other cations such as K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can all impede uptake.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980;&lt;ref name="Heenan 1981"/&gt; In acid soils Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is a particularly strong inhibitor of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake.&lt;ref name="Rengel 1989"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rengel| first= Z.|author2=Robinson, D.

Kafikfai| location=New York| publisher=Marcel Dekker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhibition by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is more severe than can be explained by simple displacement, hence it is possible that these ions bind to the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake system directly.&lt;ref name="Marschner 1995"/&gt; In bacteria and yeast, such binding by Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has already been observed. Stress responses in the plant develop as cellular processes halt due to a lack of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. maintenance of ΔpH across the plasma and vacuole membranes). In Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-starved plants under low light conditions, the percentage of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; bound to chlorophyll has been recorded at 50%.&lt;ref name="Dorenstouter 1985"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dorenstouter| first= H.|author2=Pieters, G.A. |author3=Findenegg, G.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity stress is more difficult to develop. When Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is plentiful, in general the plants take up the ion and store it (Stelzer ''et al.'', 1990). However, if this is followed by drought then ionic concentrations within the cell can increase dramatically. High cytoplasmic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations block a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel in the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast, in turn inhibiting the removal of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the chloroplast stroma. This leads to an acidification of the stroma that inactivates key enzymes in [[carbon fixation]], which all leads to the production of oxygen [[free radicals]] in the chloroplast that then cause oxidative damage.&lt;ref name="Wu 1991"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wu| first= W.|author2=Peters, J. |author3=Berkowitz, G.A.  | year=1991| title= Surface Charge-Mediated Effects of Mg2+ on K+ Flux across the Chloroplast Envelope Are Associated with Regulation of Stromal pH and Photosynthesis| journal= Plant Physiology| volume= 97| pages= 580–587| doi=10.1104/pp.97.2.580| pmid=16668438| issue=2| pmc=1081046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18752">A '''[[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[planning]] organization''' ('''MPO''') is a federally mandated and federally funded [[transportation]] policy-making organization in the [[United States]] that is made up of representatives from local [[government]] and governmental transportation authorities. They were created to ensure regional cooperation in transportation planning. MPOs were introduced by the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act|Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962]], which required the formation of an MPO for any [[urban area|urbanized area]] (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3&amp;#8209;C”) planning process. Statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes are governed by federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|23|134|135}}). Transparency through public access to participation in the planning process and [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans now is required by federal law. As of 2015, there are 408 MPOs in the United States.&lt;ref name="hepgislist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hepgis.fhwa.dot.gov/hepgismaps11/ViewMap.aspx?map=MPO+Boundaries%7CMPO+Boundary |title=MPO Boundary Data  |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Number of MPOs by state.png|thumb|Chart showing the number of Metropolitan Planning Organizations by state as of September 2015.]]

==Purpose==
Purposes of MPOs:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Transportation investment allocates scarce federal and other transportation funding resources;
* Planning needs to reflect the region’s shared vision for its future;
* Adequate transportation planning requires a comprehensive examination of the region’s future and investment alternatives; and
* An MPO acts as a Council of Governments; that is, it facilitates collaboration of governments, interested parties, and residents in the planning process.

In other words, the federal government requires that federal transportation funds be allocated to regions in a manner that has a basis in metropolitan  plans developed through intergovernmental collaboration, rational analysis, and consensus-based decision making.{{citation need|date=October 2017}}

==Governance==
Typically, an MPO [[governance]] structure includes a variety of committees as well as a professional staff. The “policy committee” is the top-level decision-making body for the planning organization. In most MPOs, the policy committee comprises:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
*elected or appointed officials from local governmental jurisdictions such as [[municipalities]] or [[county|counties]];
*representatives of different transportation [[Transport mode|modes]], such as [[public transit]], [[freight]], [[bicycle]]/[[pedestrian]]; and
*state agency officials such as, state [[Department of Transportation]], environmental agency, etc.; and
*non-voting members such as [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]], [[Federal Transit Administration|FTA]], [[FAA]], [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]], staff advisers from state departments of transportation, [[Chambers of Commerce]]

With only a few unique exceptions nationwide (such as the [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|MPO in Portland, Oregon]]), MPO policy committee members are not elected directly by citizens. Rather, a policy committee member typically is an elected or appointed official of one of the MPO’s constituent local jurisdictions. The policy committee member thus has legal authority to speak and act on behalf of that jurisdiction in the MPO setting. Federal law, however, does not require members of an MPO policy committee to be representatives of the metropolitan areas' populations. Systematic studies have found that MPO policy committees' representations of urban municipalities and disadvantaged minority populations in their areas are less than proportional to population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Thomas W. Sanchez |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 2006 |title=An Inherent Bias? Geographic and Racial-Ethnic Patterns of Metropolitan Planning Organization Boards |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2006/06/01transportation-sanchez |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Metropolitan Policy Program |series=Series on Transportation Reform |page= |docket= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy committee’s responsibilities include debating and making decisions on key MPO actions and issues, including adoption of the metropolitan long-range transportation plans, [[transportation improvement program]]s, annual planning work programs, budgets, and other policy documents. The policy committee also may play an active role in key decision points or milestones associated with MPO plans and studies, as well as conducting public hearings and meetings. An appointed advisory committee (CAC) develops the recommendations for consideration by the policy committee and establishes a ranked proposal for work plans.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Most MPOs also establish a technical committee to act as an advisory body to the policy committee for transportation issues that primarily are technical in nature. The technical committee interacts with the MPO’s professional staff on technical matters related to planning, analysis tasks, and projects. Through this work, the technical committee develops recommendations on projects and programs for policy committee consideration. Metropolitan travel forecasting is one of the key roles that the technical committee supports. The technical committee typically comprises staff-level officials of local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, a technical committee may include representatives of interest groups, various transportation modes, and local citizens. A 2005 survey of MPOs nationally commissioned in preparation of "Special Report&amp;nbsp;288" of the [[Transportation Research Board]] of the [[National Academies]] found that "forecast by negotiation" was a common method of projecting future population and employment growth for use in [[Transportation forecasting|travel forecasting]], suggesting [[rent-seeking]] behavior on the part of MPO committees influencing the technical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Committee for Determination of the State of the Practice in Metropolitan Area Travel Forecasting, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies. (2007) Metropolitan Travel Forecasting: Current Practice and Future Direction. Transportation Research Board Special Report 288. [http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/Metropolitan_Travel_Forecasting_Current_Practice_a_158933.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually MPOs retain a core professional staff in order to ensure the ability to carry out the required metropolitan planning process in an effective and expeditious manner. The size and qualifications of this staff may vary by MPO, since no two metropolitan areas have identical planning needs Most MPOs, however, require at least some staff dedicated solely to MPO process oversight and management because of the complexity of the process and need to ensure that requirements are properly addressed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Functions==
===Core functions===

There are five core functions of an MPO:
#'''establish a setting''':  establish and manage a fair and impartial setting for effective regional decision-making in the metropolitan area (UZA)
# '''evaluate alternatives''':  evaluate transportation alternatives, scaled to the size and complexity of the region, to the nature of its transportation issues, and to the realistically available options
#'''maintain a [[regional transportation plan]] (RTP)''':  develop and update a fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan for the UZA covering a planning horizon of at least twenty years that fosters
#* mobility and access for people and goods,
#* efficient system performance and preservation, and
#* quality of life
# '''develop a [[transportation improvement program]] (TIP)''': develop a fiscally constrained program based on the long-range transportation plan and designed to serve the UZA’s goals while using spending, regulating, operating, management, and financial tools
#'''involve the public''': involve the general public and all the significantly affected sub-groups in the four essential functions listed above.

If the metropolitan area is designated as an [[air quality]] [[non-attainment area|non-attainment]] or maintenance area, then

#&lt;li value="6"&gt;'''protect air quality''': transportation plans, programs, and projects must conform with the air quality plan, known as the “[[State Implementation Plan|state implementation plan]]” (SIP), for the state within which the UZA lies.

Presently, most MPOs have no authority to raise revenues such as to levy taxes on their own, rather, they are designed to allow local officials to decide collaboratively how to spend available federal and other governmental transportation funds in their urbanized areas. The funding for the operations of an MPO comes from a combination of federal transportation funds and required matching funds from state and local governments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Expanded functions===
In some regions, MPOs have been given authority to handle expanded functions:

* Managing a regional [[urban growth boundary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary|title=Urban growth boundary|author=|date=19 May 2014|website=oregonmetro.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distributing a Regional Housing Need Allocation to [[Smart growth|manage growth]] and ensure [[affordable housing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/planning/housingneeds/|title=ABAG Planning: Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA)|author=|date=|website=www.abag.ca.gov|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operating the region's [[public transportation]] services&lt;ref&gt;Governing Metropolitan Areas: Growth and Change in a Networked Age. David K. Hamilton, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of MPO organizations==
MPOs differ greatly in various parts of the country and even within states. Some have large staffs, while others may include only a director and a transportation planner. Sometimes the professional staff of an MPO is provided by a county or a council of governments. In many urban areas, existing organizations such as county governments or councils of government also function as MPOs. The MPO role also may be played by an independent governmental organization or a regional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Alexander|title=Staffing and Administrative Capacity of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|url=http://www.cutr.usf.edu/programs/pcm/files/2010-05-Staffing_and_Administrative_Capacity_of_MPOs.pdf|work=Staffing and Administrative Structure of Metropolitan Planning Organizations|publisher=CUTR/FHWA|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, for example, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] is the MPO. In the [[Minneapolis-St.&amp;nbsp;Paul, Minnesota]], metropolitan area, the [[Metropolitan Council]] is the MPO.

An example of a medium-sized MPO is the [[Lexington Area MPO]] in [[Kentucky]]. An example of a small MPO is the [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery Area MPO]] in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smrpc.org/transportation|title=/kacts/kacts.htm smrpc.org|author=|date=|website=smrpc.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another MPO planning organization has developed in the area of western central [[Florida]]. Several MPOs there, with governance over eight counties, have developed a greater regional planning committee, the Chairs Coordinating Committee (CCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionaltransportation.org/|title=Chairs Coordinating Committee|first=|last=Developer|date=|website=www.regionaltransportation.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of the chairs of seven MPOs and the chairs of their appointed advisory committee (or their representatives) in order to coordinate transportation planning for the region, that is compatible with all, as well as addressing the challenges of long range planning for a large and growing region that has overlapping issues among the MPOs or transportation plans that extend throughout the entire area. Often the members of the executive committee of an MPO act interchangeably as the representative to this seven-MPO regional committee. This committee meets less frequently than the participating MPOs.

==Evolving role==
The enactment of the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA) ushered in a “renaissance” for MPOs. After a decade or more of being consigned to a minimal role in transportation planning, ISTEA directed additional federal funding to MPOs, expanded their authority to select projects, and mandated new metropolitan planning initiatives. For the first time, state transportation officials were required to consult seriously with local representatives on MPO governing boards regarding matters of project prioritization and decision-making. These changes had their roots in the need to address increasingly difficult transportation problems&amp;mdash;in particular, the more complicated patterns of [[traffic congestion]] that arose with the [[suburban]] development boom in the previous decades. Many recognized that the problems could only be addressed effectively through a stronger federal commitment to regional planning.

The legislation that emerged, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), was signed into federal law by President [[George H.&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]] in December 1991. It focused on improving transportation, not as an end in itself, but as the means to achieve important national goals including economic progress, [[Air pollution|cleaner air]], [[energy conservation]], and [[social equity]]. ISTEA promoted a transportation system in which different modes and facilities&amp;mdash;highway, transit, [[pedestrian]], [[bicycle]], [[aviation]], and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]&amp;mdash;were integrated to allow a "seamless" movement of both goods and people. New funding programs provided greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly regarding using previously restricted highway funds for transit development,  improved "[[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]]" connections, and emphasized upgrades to existing facilities over building new capacity&amp;mdash;particularly roadway capacity.

To accomplish more serious metropolitan planning, ISTEA doubled federal funding for MPO operations and required the agencies to evaluate a variety of [[multimodal transport|multimodal]] solutions to roadway congestion and other transportation problems. MPOs also were required to broaden public participation in the planning process and to see that investment decisions contributed to meeting the air quality standards of the [[Clean Air Act Amendments]].

In addition, ISTEA placed a new requirement on MPOs to conduct “fiscally constrained planning”, and ensure that long-range transportation plans and short-term [[transportation improvement program]]s were fiscally constrained; in other words, adopted plans and programs can not include more projects than reasonably can be expected to be funded through existing or projected sources of revenues. This new requirement represented a major conceptual shift for many MPOs (and others in the planning community), since the imposition of fiscal discipline on plans now required, not only understanding how much money might be available, but how to prioritize investment needs and make difficult choices among competing needs. Adding to this complexity is the need to plan across transportation modes and develop approaches for multimodal investment prioritization and decision making. It is in this context of greater prominence, funding, and requirements that MPOs function today.

An annual element is composed of transportation improvement projects contained in an area's transportation improvement program (TIP), which is proposed for implementation during the current year. The annual element is submitted to the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Transportation]] as part of the required planning process.

The passage of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [[SAFETEA&amp;#8209;LU]] in 2005 created new and revised requirements for transportation planning and programs. Although SAFETEA-LU increased standards, most MPOs already were in compliance with the regulations. Some of the planning topic areas include transportation systems security, emergency preparedness, public participation plans for metropolitan planning, and requiring the [[Internet|electronic publication]] of plans and TIP/STIP by the MPOs.

SAFETEA-LU requires that the statewide transportation planning process and the metropolitan planning process provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;49 USC 5303(g)(3) and 23 USC 134(g)(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1948, J. R. Butler and Martin Miller formed an oil and gas consulting partnership known as J. R. Butler and Company.  Max Lents, who was not a partner at the beginning of J. R. Butler and Company, was considered as an original founding partner when he joined the firm a year later.  The company name then changed to Butler, Miller and Lents.

In 1970 its name was changed to Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd., at which time it became a [[S corporation|Subchapter S Corporation]].

In 1976, the name of the firm was changed to its current name, Miller and Lents, Ltd. after J. R. Butler exchanged his interest in Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd.

== Notable employees ==
=== M. Miller and M. Lents ===
In addition to founding Miller and Lents, Ltd., Max Lents and Martin Miller made significant contributions to the field of petroleum engineering.  They introduced the Miller-Lents [[Permeability (earth sciences)|Permeability]] Distribution which aids in describing the permeability of heterogeneous reservoirs and provides a “better match with actual field performance when applied to cycling operations in gas condensate reservoirs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=James T.|last2=Cobb|first2=William M.|title=Waterflooding|date=17 Dec 1997|publisher=Petroleum Recovery Research Center|pages=5–20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== S. J. Steiber === 
Steiber was a Petroleum Engineer with Miller and Lents, Ltd. from 1974 to 2004.  He made significant contributions to the field of Petroleum Engineering and the practice of Oil and Gas Well log analysis.   In his paper “The Distribution of Shale in Sandstones and its Effect upon [[Porosity]],” co-authored by E.C. Thomas in 1975, he introduced the Thomas-Steiber Diagram which is still commonly used for log analysis today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=E.C.|last2=Stieber|first2=S.J|title=The Distribution of Shale in Sandstones and its Effect on Porosity|date=1975|publisher=Society of Professional Well Log Analysts Inc.|location=United States.|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">[[File:Poster-museumofchristianart.jpg|thumb|Poster from the Museum of Christian Art, Goa.]]The '''Museum of Christian Art''', in the former colonial capital of [[Old Goa]], is a museum of [[Christian art]].

==About==

The [[museum]] is located in the [[Convent of Santa Monica]] in [[Old Goa]], [[Goa]]. It is open from 9.30 am to 5 pm on all days, Monday to Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028221617/http://museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |archive-date=2013-10-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a project of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] and was set up with technical and financial assistance from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] ([[INTACH]]), [[New Delhi]]. Earlier, it was located at the [[Seminary of Rachol]], [[Salcete]], [[Goa]].

==Exhibits==

Its exhibits are divided into the following categories:
* [[Sculptures]]
* [[Furniture]]
* [[Ivory]]
* [[Paintings]]
* [[Textiles]]
* [[Precious Metals]]
* [[Metals]]
* Miscellaneous

==Statuary, paintings, sculptures==

The ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' says: "Within the [[Convent of St. Monica]], the excellent Museum of Christian Art contains statuary, paintings and sculptures transferred here from the [[Rachol Seminary]]. Many of the works of [[Goan]] [[Christian art]] during the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era were produced by local [[Hindu]] artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130092135/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |archive-date=2012-01-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious silverware==

''[[Fodors]]'', another [[travel guide]], notes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207105925/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |archive-date=2013-12-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the museum is located inside the [[Convent of St. Monica]], and "has a number of objects of [[Christian]] interest, including paintings and religious silverware, some dating back to the 16th century." It also notes that this convent was the first nunnery of its kind in the [[East]] and continued until the late 19th century.

==Christian art, elsewhere==

In [[Goa]], the [[Goa State Museum]] also houses a Christian Art Gallery. In August 2011, [[Mumbai]] also announced plans to open its museum of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-16/mumbai/29891827_1_church-artefacts-museum-christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art heist==

In January 2012, a major art heist was reported&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/goa/30666486_1_security-guard-museum-burgled&lt;/ref&gt; at the museum. There was no detailed listing of the items that were stolen, in a case which saw a security guard being killed.

'''Neo-expressionism''' is a style of [[Late Modernism|late modernist]] or early-[[Postmodern art|postmodern]] painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called ''[[Transavantgarde]]'', ''[[Junge Wilde]]'' or ''Neue Wilden'' ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against [[conceptual art]] and [[minimal art]] of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an [[abstract art|abstract]] manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by [[German Expressionist]] painters, such as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[James Ensor]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. It is also related to American [[Lyrical Abstraction]] painting of the 1960s and 1970s, [[The Hairy Who]] movement in Chicago, the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of [[Abstract Expressionism]], New Image Painting and precedents in [[Pop art|Pop Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many  critics, such as [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] and [[Donald Kuspit]], as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated.

Critics such as [[Benjamin Buchloh]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]], and [[Mira Schor]] were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the [[anti-feminism|backlash against feminism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and [[Maria Lassnig]] were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 "New Spirit in Painting" exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

'''Ninon Hesse''' (née Ausländer, born 18 September 1895 in [[Czernowitz]], died 22 September 1966 in [[Montagnola]]) was an [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Hermann Hesse]]'s third wife.

Ninon Ausländer was born to a Jewish lawyer in Czernowitz and studied [[archaeology]], art history and [[medicine]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. In 1918, she married [[Caricature|caricaturist]] B. F. Dolbin, whom she left in 1920; the official [[divorce]] only took place in 1931.

Although she had written a letter to Hesse after reading his [[novel]] ''[[Peter Camenzind]]'' in 1910, she only met him in 1922. The two lived together from 1927 and got married in 1931.

Ninon Hesse played an important role in Hermann Hesse's life not only as the love of his life, but also as she helped him to continue with his work when his eyes got weak by reading to him and writing for him and by collecting and editing his writings and letters after his death in 1962.

Artist Zhu Haogu created the '''''Paradise of Maitreya''''' (彌勒佛說法圖) wall painting during China’s [[Yuan Dynasty]]. The painting was originally housed in the Xinghua Si Temple of Xiaoning, [[Shanxi]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, it was disassembled and moved to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] (ROM) of [[Toronto]], Canada, where it remains today. Museum officials have undertaken a series of restorations to preserve and stabilize the painting. Currently, it can be found in the museum’s "Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art" as part of the Far Eastern Collection and is described as one of its must-see Iconic Objects.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2006_7153_1 ''The Paradise of Maitreya wall-painting''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]],&lt;ref name="ROM 2012"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, [http://www.rom.on.ca/en/collections-research/rom-channel/iconic-paradise-meitreya ''Iconic: The Paradise of Maitreya''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a future Buddha who is foretold to appear on Earth in order to help humans achieve enlightenment through the teachings of dharma.&lt;ref name ="McBride"&gt;McBride &amp; Richard, ''Silla Buddhism and the Hwarang'', ''Korean Studies, 34, 54-89'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

As it stands today, the wall painting measures 502&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 1101&amp;nbsp;cm in length and has a symmetrical composition, notable for its high level of detail.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt; It features Buddha Maitreya in the centre of an imagined heaven, surrounded on both sides by monks and the ruling king and queen. Although Buddha Maitreya is commonly depicted as an Indian figure, all of the characters in The Paradise of Maitreya are found to be wearing Chinese robes and clothing.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

The piece foretells the coming of the coming of the Buddha Maitreya, who is said to appear on Earth in its darkest hour to save humanity from [[samsara]].&lt;ref name ="McBride" /&gt; The royal family depicted in the painting is gathering the first assembly; leading 84,000 newly converted followers into salvation. Both the king and the queen have bald, shaven heads,&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; which, in Buddhist culture, represents turning towards enlightenment and nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Eilberg-Schwartz &amp; Doniger ''Off with Her Head!: The Denial of Women's Identity in Myth, Religion and Culture'', University of California Press, page 33, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==

The famed painter and Buddhist monk, Zhu Haogu (朱好古), along with his pupil Zhang Boyuan (張伯淵), created the dry fresco painting on the southwestern portion of the Xinghua Si (興化寺) monastery during China’s Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name ="Mclean"&gt;McLean, Dziadowiec &amp; Kirinkov, [https://www.cac-accr.ca/files/pdf/EJournalVol33_abstract2.pdf "Conservation of the Chinese Temple Painting The Paradise of Maitreya from the Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare the monastery wall for this type of painting, it was covered first with a mudded layer of clay, followed by a layer of straw and additional layer of clay, giving the surface a workable texture. From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Movement ==

During the 1920s, the various armies of the [[Warlord Era|Chinese warlords]] would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in [[Taiyuan]]. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

In 1928, Anglican Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Honan)]] heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5&amp;nbsp;year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to [[Tianjin]], then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt;

== Restoration at the Royal Ontario Museum ==

While the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="ROM 2013" /&gt;

=== Initial restoration ===

Restoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work’s movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement.&lt;ref name="ROM 2012" /&gt; After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM’s Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the [[Fogg Museum|Fogg Art Museum]] using a [[polyvinyl acetate]] resin.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ROM ===

As part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the [[Masonite]] panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.&lt;ref name ="Mclean" /&gt;

== Dating ==

While ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn’t until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of ''qingshen''. White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt"&gt;Steinhardt, "A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style", "Artibus Asiae, 48, 1, 5-38", 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting “da Yuan guo” (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting’s date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription ''wuzu'', not ''qingshen'', however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term ''wuzu'' was referring to the year 1298.&lt;ref name ="Steinhardt" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===

As most of the painting’s inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting’s background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting’s date. As such, ''The Paradise of Maitreya'' remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "Further Observations on the Yuan Wall Painter Zhu Haogu and the Relationship of the Chunyang Hall Wall Paintings to The Maitreya Paradise at the ROM", "Artibus Asiae, 52, 1, 94-118", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phage display protocol.png|right|thumb|
The sequence of events that are followed in phage display screening to identify polypeptides that bind with high affinity to desired target protein or DNA sequence.]]
'''Phage display''' is a laboratory technique for the study of [[Protein–protein interaction|protein–protein]], [[protein]]–[[peptide]], and protein–[[DNA]] interactions that uses [[bacteriophage]]s ([[viruses]] that infect [[bacteria]]) to connect proteins with the [[genetic information]] that [[code|encodes]] them.&lt;ref name="Smith_1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith GP | title = Filamentous fusion phage: novel expression vectors that display cloned antigens on the virion surface | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4705 | pages = 1315–7 |date=June 1985 | pmid = 4001944 | doi = 10.1126/science.4001944 |bibcode = 1985Sci...228.1315S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest is inserted into a phage [[viral coat protein|coat protein]] gene, causing the phage to "display" the protein on its outside while containing the gene for the protein on its inside, resulting in a  connection between [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]]. These displaying phages can then be screened against other proteins, peptides or DNA sequences, in order to detect interaction between the displayed protein and those other molecules. In this way, large [[protein fragment library|libraries of proteins]] can be screened and [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplified]] in a process called ''[[in vitro]]'' selection, which is analogous to [[natural selection]].

The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are [[M13 bacteriophage|M13]] and fd [[filamentous phage]],&lt;ref name="pmid11848876"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith GP, Petrenko VA | title = Phage Display | journal = Chem.

==History==
Phage display was first described by [[George Smith (chemist)|George P. Smith]] in 1985, when he demonstrated the display of peptides on [[filamentous phage]] by creating [[Fusion protein|fusion]] of the virus's [[Capsid|capsid protein]] to a library of [[peptide]] sequences.&lt;ref name="Smith_1985" /&gt; This displayed the peptides on the viral surface, where those with the highest binding affinity could be selected. A patent by George Pieczenik claiming priority from 1985 also describes the generation of phage display libraries.&lt;ref name="US_5866363"&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 5866363  | status = patent | title = Method and means for sorting and identifying biological information | pubdate = 1999-02-02 | fdate = 1991-02-28 | pridate = 1985-08-28 | inventor = Pieczenik G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was further developed and improved by groups at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] with [[Greg Winter]] and [[John McCafferty]], The [[Scripps Research Institute]] with Lerner and Barbas and the [[German Cancer Research Center]] with Breitling and Dübel for display of proteins such as [[antibodies]] for [[therapeutic]] [[protein engineering]]. Smith and Winter were awarded a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their contribution to developing phage display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

Like the [[two-hybrid system]], phage display is used for the high-throughput screening of protein interactions. In the case of [[M13 bacteriophage|M13 filamentous phage]] display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major [[Protein of the viral capsid|coat protein]], respectively. [[Multiple cloning site]]s are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible [[reading frames]] so that the [[cDNA]] fragment is [[Gene translation|translated]] in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert [[DNA hybridization|DNA hybrid]] is then inserted (a process known as "[[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]") into ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (E. coli) bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue ''E. coli''. If a "[[phagemid]]" [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is used (a simplified display construct vector) [[virus|phage particles]] will not be released from the ''E. coli'' cells until they are infected with [[Helper virus|helper phage]], which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature [[virus|virions]] with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. 
By immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a [[microtiter plate]] well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be [[elution|eluted]], used to produce more phage (by [[bacteria]]l infection with helper phage) and to produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as [[Biopanning|'panning']], in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials.
Phage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments.

The use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology.&lt;ref name="pmid17088290"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasteen L, Ayriss J, Pavlik P, Bradbury AR | title = Eliminating helper phage from phage display | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = e145 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17088290 | pmc = 1693883 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elution can be done combining low-pH elution [[buffering agent|buffer]] with sonification, which, in addition to loosening the peptide-target interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface. This [[ultrasound]]-based method enables single-step selection of a high-affinity peptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lunder M, Bratkovič T, Urleb U, Kreft S, Štrukelj B | year = 2009 | title = Ultrasound in phage display: a new approach to nonspecific elution | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2008/June/Ultrasound-in-phage-display-a-new-approach-to-nonspecific-elution/biotechniques-45186.html | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 893–900 | doi = 10.2144/000112759 | pmid = 18533899 | access-date = 2016-05-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160804041326/http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2008/June/Ultrasound-in-phage-display-a-new-approach-to-nonspecific-elution/biotechniques-45186.html | archive-date = 2016-08-04 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Applications of phage display technology include determination of interaction partners of a protein (which would be used as the immobilised phage "bait" with a DNA library consisting of all [[coding region|coding sequences]] of a cell, tissue or organism) so that the function or the mechanism of the function of that protein may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060628072224/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020763.html Explanation of "Protein interaction mapping" from The Wellcome Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; Phage display is also a widely used method for ''in vitro'' protein evolution (also called [[protein engineering]]). As such, phage display is a useful tool in [[drug discovery]]. It is used for finding new [[ligand]]s (enzyme inhibitors, receptor agonists and antagonists) to target proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid16258189"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lunder M, Bratkovic T, Doljak B, Kreft S, Urleb U, Strukelj B, Plazar N | title = Comparison of bacterial and phage display peptide libraries in search of target-binding motif | journal = Appl.

=== Antibody maturation ''in vitro'' ===
The invention of [[antibody]] phage display revolutionised antibody drug discovery. Initial work was done by laboratories at the [[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] ([[Greg Winter]] and [[John McCafferty]]), the [[Scripps Research Institute]] (Richard Lerner and Carlos F.

Phage display of antibody libraries has become a powerful method for both studying the immune response as well as a method to rapidly select and evolve human antibodies for therapy. Antibody phage display was later used by Carlos F. Barbas at The Scripps Research Institute to create synthetic human antibody libraries, a principle first patented in 1990 by Breitling and coworkers (Patent CA 2035384), thereby allowing human antibodies to be created in vitro from synthetic diversity elements.&lt;ref name="pmid1584777"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barbas CF, Bain JD, Hoekstra DM, Lerner RA | title = Semisynthetic combinatorial antibody libraries: a chemical solution to the diversity problem | journal = Proc.

Antibody libraries displaying millions of different antibodies on phage are often used in the pharmaceutical industry to isolate highly specific therapeutic antibody leads, for development into antibody drugs primarily as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapeutics. One of the most successful was [[adalimumab]], discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] as D2E7 and developed and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]].

== General protocol ==

Below is the sequence of events that are followed in phage display screening to identify polypeptides that bind with high affinity to desired target protein or DNA sequence:
# Target proteins or DNA sequences are immobilized to the wells of a [[microtiter plate]].
# Many genetic sequences are expressed in a [[bacteriophage]] library in the form of fusions with the bacteriophage coat protein, so that they are displayed on the surface of the viral particle. The protein displayed corresponds to the genetic sequence within the phage.
# This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed.
# Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away.
# Attached phage may be [[eluted]] and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture.
# Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library in binding proteins. 
# Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within in the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments.

=== Filamentous phages ===

==== pIII ====

pIII is the protein that determines the infectivity of the virion. pIII is composed of three domains (N1, N2 and CT) connected by glycine-rich linkers.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lowman HB, Clackson T | title = Phage display: a practical approach | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2004 | pages = 10–11 | isbn = 0-19-963873-X | chapter =  1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The N2 domain binds to the F pilus during virion infection freeing the N1 domain which then interacts with a TolA protein on the surface of the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; Insertions within this protein are usually added in position 249 (within a linker region between CT and N2), position 198 (within the N2 domain) and at the N-terminus (inserted between the N-terminal secretion sequence and the N-terminus of pIII).&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; However, when using the BamHI site located at position 198 one must be careful of the unpaired Cysteine residue (C201) that could cause problems during phage display if one is using a non-truncated version of pIII.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

An advantage of using pIII rather than pVIII is that pIII allows for monovalent display when using a phagemid (Ff-phage derived plasmid) combined with a helper phage. Moreover, pIII allows for the insertion of larger protein sequences (&gt;100 amino acids)&lt;ref name="pmid10669603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sidhu SS, Weiss GA, Wells JA | title = High copy display of large proteins on phage for functional selections | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 296 | issue = 2 | pages = 487–95 |date=February 2000 | pmid = 10669603 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is more tolerant to it than pVIII. However, using pIII as the fusion partner can lead to a decrease in phage infectivity leading to problems such as selection bias caused by difference in phage growth rate&lt;ref name="pmid20583018"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derda R, Tang SK, Whitesides GM | title = Uniform amplification of phage with different growth characteristics in individual compartments consisting of monodisperse droplets | journal = Angew.

==== pVIII ====

pVIII is the main coat protein of Ff phages. Peptides are usually fused to the N-terminus of pVIII.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; Usually peptides that can be fused to pVIII are 6-8 amino acids long.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; The size restriction seems to have less to do with structural impediment caused by the added section&lt;ref name="Malik_1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malik P, Terry TD, Bellintani F, Perham RN | title = Factors limiting display of foreign peptides on the major coat protein of filamentous bacteriophage capsids and a potential role for leader peptidase | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 436 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–6 |date=October 1998 | pmid = 9781692 | doi = 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more to do with the size exclusion caused by pIV during coat protein export.&lt;ref name="Malik_1998"/&gt; Since there are around 2700 copies of the protein on a typical phages, it is more likely that the protein of interest will be expressed polyvalently even if a phagemid is used.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; This makes the use of this protein unfavorable for the discovery of high affinity binding partners.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

To overcome the size problem of pVIII, artificial coat proteins have been designed.&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiss GA, Sidhu SS | title = Design and evolution of artificial M13 coat proteins | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 300 | issue = 1 | pages = 213–9 |date=June 2000 | pmid = 10864510 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2000.3845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is Weiss and Sidhu's inverted artificial coat protein (ACP) which allows the display of large proteins at the C-terminus.&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"/&gt; The ACP's could display a protein of 20kDa, however, only at low levels (mostly only monovalently).&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"/&gt;

==== pVI ====

pVI has been widely used for the display of cDNA libraries.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; The display of cDNA libraries via phage display is an attractive alternative to the yeast-2-hybrid method for the discovery of interacting proteins and peptides due to its high throughput capability.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; pVI has been used preferentially to pVIII and pIII for the expression of cDNA libraries because one can add the protein of interest to the C-terminus of pVI without greatly affecting pVI's role in phage assembly. This means that the stop codon in the cDNA is no longer an issue.&lt;ref name="pmid9634780"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jespers LS, Messens JH, De Keyser A, Eeckhout D, Van den Brande I, Gansemans YG, Lauwereys MJ, Vlasuk GP, Stanssens PE | title = Surface expression and ligand-based selection of cDNAs fused to filamentous phage gene VI | journal = Bio/Technology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 378–82 |date=April 1995 | pmid = 9634780 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0495-378}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, phage display of cDNA is always limited by the inability of most prokaryotes in producing post-translational modifications present in eukaryotic cells or by the misfolding of multi-domain proteins.

While pVI has been useful for the analysis of cDNA libraries, pIII and pVIII remain the most utilized coat proteins for phage display.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

==== pVII and pIX ====

In an experiment in 1995, display of Glutathione S-transferase was attempted on both pVII and pIX and failed.&lt;ref name="pmid7616570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Endemann H, Model P | title = Location of filamentous phage minor coat proteins in phage and in infected cells | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 250 | issue = 4 | pages = 496–506 |date=July 1995 | pmid = 7616570 | doi =  10.1006/jmbi.1995.0393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, phage display of this protein was completed successfully after the addition of a periplasmic signal sequence (pelB or ompA) on the N-terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid10339535"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gao C, Mao S, Lo CH, Wirsching P, Lerner RA, Janda KD | title = Making artificial antibodies: a format for phage display of combinatorial heterodimeric arrays | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 96 | issue = 11 | pages = 6025–30 |date=May 1999 | pmid = 10339535 | pmc = 26829 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.96.11.6025|bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.6025G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study, it has been shown that AviTag, FLAG and His could be displayed on pVII without the need of a signal sequence.  Then the expression of single chain Fv's (scFv), and single chain T cell receptors (scTCR) were expressed both with and without the signal sequence.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Løset GÅ, Roos N, Bogen B, Sandlie I | title = Expanding the versatility of phage display II: improved affinity selection of folded domains on protein VII and IX of the filamentous phage | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = e17433 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21390283 | pmc = 3044770 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017433 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...617433L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PelB (an amino acid signal sequence that targets the protein to the periplasm where a signal peptidase then cleaves off PelB) improved the phage display level when compared to pVII and pIX fusions without the signal sequence. However, this led to the incorporation of more helper phage genomes rather than phagemid genomes. In all cases, phage display levels were lower than using pIII fusion. However, lower display might be more favorable for the selection of binders due to lower display being closer to true monovalent display. In five out of six occasions, pVII and pIX fusions without pelB was more efficient than pIII fusions in affinity selection assays. The paper even goes on to state that pVII and pIX display platforms may outperform pIII in the long run.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"/&gt;

The use of pVII and pIX instead of pIII might also be an advantage because virion rescue may be undertaken without breaking the virion-antigen bond if the pIII used is wild type. Instead, one could cleave in a section between the bead and the antigen to elute. Since the pIII is intact it does not matter whether the antigen remains bound to the phage.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"/&gt;

=== T7 phages ===

The issue of using Ff phages for phage display is that they require the protein of interest to be translocated across the bacterial inner membrane before they are assembled into the phage.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danner S, Belasco JG | title = T7 phage display: a novel genetic selection system for cloning RNA-binding proteins from cDNA libraries | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 98 | issue = 23 | pages = 12954–9 |date=November 2001 | pmid = 11606722 | pmc = 60806 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211439598 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...9812954D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins cannot undergo this process and therefore cannot be displayed on the surface of Ff phages. In these cases, T7 phage display is used instead.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"/&gt; In T7 phage display, the protein to be displayed is attached to the C-terminus of the gene 10 capsid protein of T7.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"/&gt;
 
The disadvantage of using T7 is that the size of the  protein that can be expressed on the surface is limited to shorter peptides because large changes to the T7 genome cannot be accommodated like it is in M13 where the phage just makes its coat longer to fit the larger genome within it. However, it can be useful for the production of a large protein library for scFV selection where the scFV is expressed on an M13 phage and the antigens are expressed on the surface of the T7 phage.&lt;ref name="pmid11687245"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castillo J, Goodson B, Winter J | title = T7 displayed peptides as targets for selecting peptide specific scFvs from M13 scFv display libraries | journal = J.

The '''Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research''' ('''PIK''') is a German government-funded research institute addressing crucial scientific questions in the fields of global change, climate impacts, and [[sustainable development]]. Ranked among the top environmental [[think tank]]s worldwide, it is one of the leading research institutions and part of a global network of scientific and academic institutions working on questions of global environmental change. It is a member of the [[Leibniz Association]], whose institutions perform research on subjects of high relevance to society.

== History ==

PIK was founded in 1992 by its current director, [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]]. About 400 people work at the institute that is located on [[Potsdam]]'s historic [[Telegrafenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pik-potsdam.de/institute/organization ''PIK Research Portal'' – Organization]. Web site of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Visited on August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the natural and social sciences analyze the earth system and develop strategies and solution pathways for a sustainable development.

== Partners ==

PIK provides information to international organizations like the [[World Bank]] as well as to regional bodies like the [[Federal Government of Germany]] and the [[European Commission]]. PIK scientists also contribute to the reports of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC). The IPCC working group Climate Change mitigation is coordinated by the institute's deputy director and chief economist [[Ottmar Edenhofer]].

In 2007, PIK initiated a biennial Nobel Laureates' Symposium series on global sustainability. The fourth annual symposium is scheduled for April 22, 2015 and will be held in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;[http://www.nobelcause.org/ Nobel Laureates' Symposium series website]&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first time that the Laureates' Symposium will be held outside Europe and will be focused on the rapid urbanization East Asia and Pacific region.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

In 2010, PIK collaborated with the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]] to found Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climate-kic.org/networks/academic-partners/ ''Climate-KIC'' – Academic Partners]. Web site of Climate-KIC. Visited on August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this partnership, PIK works with other companies and academic institutions to address sustainable growth through climate change mitigation and adaptation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Climate-KIC|url=http://www.climate-kic.org/about/|website=climate-kic.org|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">In [[computer science]], particularly in [[human-computer interaction]], '''presentation semantics''' specify how a particular piece of a [[formal language]] is represented in a distinguished manner accessible to [[human senses]], usually human vision. For example, saying that &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;bold&gt; ... &lt;/bold&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must render the text between these constructs using some [[bold typeface]] is a specification of presentation semantics for that [[syntax]]. An example of  interactive presentation semantics is defining the expected behavior of a [[Hyperlink|hypertext link]] on a suitable syntax.

Many [[markup languages]] like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[DSSSL]], [[XSL-FO]] or [[troff]] have presentation semantics, but others like [[XML]], [[XLink]] and [[XPath]] do not.&lt;ref&gt; H. P.

{{evolutionary biology}}

'''Punctuated equilibrium''' (also called '''punctuated equilibria''') is a theory in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]] which proposes that once [[species]] appear in the [[fossil record]] the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history.&lt;ref name="pe1972"&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82-115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge ''Time frames''. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985, pp. 193-223. ([http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6564 2nd draft], [http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6567 3rd final draft], [http://www.somosbacteriasyvirus.com/phyletic.pdf Published draft])&lt;/ref&gt; This state of little or no morphological change is called ''stasis''. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and [[geologic time scale|geologically rapid]] events of branching speciation called [[cladogenesis]]. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, &amp; Eldredge, Niles (1977). [http://www.johnboccio.com/courses/SOC26/Bak-Sneppan/07_Gould.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered."] ''Paleobiology'' '''3''' (2): 115-151. (p.145)&lt;/ref&gt;

Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called [[anagenesis]]). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"&gt;Gould, S. J.

In 1972, paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it ''punctuated equilibria''.&lt;ref name="pe1972"/&gt;  Their paper built upon [[Ernst Mayr]]'s model of [[allopatric speciation|geographic speciation]],&lt;ref name=Mayr1954&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1954).

==History==
Punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of [[Ernst Mayr]]'s concept of [[Founder effect|genetic revolutions]] by [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] and especially [[peripatric speciation]] as applied to the fossil record. Although the sudden appearance of species and its relationship to speciation was proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954,&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; [[history of science|historians of science]] generally recognize the 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper as the basis of the new [[paleobiology|paleobiological]] research program.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1992).

New York: Oxford University Press, pp. [https://www.docdroid.net/29yd6nq/michael-shermer-the-paradox-of-the-paradigm.pdf 97-116.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary, Dana (2008).

New York: Columbia University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] discontinuity (or "sudden jumps")&lt;ref&gt;Schindewolf, Otto (1936). ''Paldontologie, Entwicklungslehre und Genetik''. Berlin: Borntraeger.&lt;/ref&gt; found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"/&gt; Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and that punctuated equilibrium "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Mayr1992 /&gt;

A year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, [[Niles Eldredge]] published a paper in the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of [[allopatric speciation]] might suggest a possible resolution.&lt;ref name=eldredge1971 /&gt;

The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the [[Geological Society of America|Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=pe1972/&gt; The symposium focused its attention on how modern [[microevolution]]ary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that "Eldredge's 1971 publication [on [[Paleozoic]] [[trilobite]]s] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly."&lt;ref name="StructureofEvolutionaryTheory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first= S. J. |date=2002 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn =0-674-00613-5 |page=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gould "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term ''punctuated equilibrium'' and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould."&lt;ref name=Opus200&gt;Gould, S. J. (1991). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_opus200.html "Opus 200"] ''Natural History'' 100 (August): 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Time Frames'' Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, N. 1985. ''Time Frames: The evolution of punctuated equilibria''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wilkins and Gareth Nelson have argued that French architect [[Pierre Trémaux]] proposed an "anticipation of the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould and Eldredge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = John S. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = G.J. | year = 2008 | title = Trémaux on species: A theory of allopatric speciation (and punctuated equilibrium) before Wagner | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3881/1/Tremaux-on-species.pdf | format = PDF | journal = History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 179–206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical mechanisms==
===Punctuational change===
When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, [[allopatric speciation]] was considered the "standard" model of speciation.&lt;ref name=pe1972 /&gt; This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper "Change of genetic environment and evolution,"&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; and his classic volume ''Animal Species and Evolution'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1963). ''Animal Species and Evolution''. Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Allopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of [[gene flow]]. New and even [[Mutation#Beneficial mutations|beneficial mutations]] are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogenizing]] effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from [[natural selection]] is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This [[hypothesis]] was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper:

{{quote|Rapidly evolving peripherally isolated populations may be the place of origin of many evolutionary novelties. Their isolation and comparatively small size may explain phenomena of rapid evolution and lack of documentation in the fossil record, hitherto puzzling to the palaeontologist.&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt;}}

Although punctuated equilibrium generally applies to sexually reproducing organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/science_on-punctuated-equilibria.html "On punctuated equilibria (letter)."] ''Science'' 276 (5311): 337-341.&lt;/ref&gt; some biologists have applied the model to non-sexual species like [[virus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, S.T, Joan Rowe, and Walter M. Fitch (1993).

As time went on biologists like Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"/&gt; Gould, for example, was particularly attracted to [[Douglas J. Futuyma|Douglas Futuyma's]] work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas |date=1987 |title=On the role of species in anagenesis |journal=[[The American Naturalist|American Naturalist]] |doi=10.1086/284724 |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=465–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stasis===
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the [[wikt:putative|putative]] causes of stasis. Gould was initially attracted to [[I. Michael Lerner]]'s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis. However this hypothesis was rejected over time,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence accumulated against it.&lt;ref name=Futuyma86&gt;Futuyma, Douglas (2005). ''Evolution''.

Biol.''  '''177''', 401-409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the existence of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of [[sibling species]], species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1989). ''Did Darwin Get it Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gould, "stasis may emerge as the theory's most important contribution to evolutionary science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA1155 872.]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Kim Sterelny]] in clarifying the meaning of stasis adds, "In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] mean. [[Jonathan Weiner]]'s ''[[The Beak of the Finch]]'' describes this very process."&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, Kim (2007). ''[[Dawkins vs. Gould|Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest]]''. Cambridge, U.K.: Icon Books, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical evolution===
Punctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are [[Unit of selection|Darwinian individuals]], and not just [[class (biology)|classes]], thereby providing a stronger framework for a [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|hierarchical theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref name="CoordinatedStasis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brett |first1=Carlton E. |last2=Ivany |first2=Linda C. |last3=Schopf |first3=Kenneth M. |date=1996 |title=Coordinated stasis: An overview |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00085-5 |volume=127 |issue=1–4 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common misconceptions==
Much confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, how fast the punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like [[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]], [[quantum evolution]], and [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name="gould_pe-fact-theory"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1992) [http://systematicbiology.co.nf/Gould_1989_PunctuatedEquilibriumFactTheory.pdf "Punctuated equilibrium in fact and theory."] In Albert Somit and Steven Peterson ''The Dynamics of Evolution''. New York: Cornell University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saltationism===
[[File:Punctuated Equilibrium.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Alternative explanations for the punctuated pattern of evolution observed in the fossil record. Both [[macromutation]] and relatively rapid episodes of gradual evolution could give the appearance of instantaneous change, since 10,000 years seldom registers in the geological record.]]

The punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould's theory. Gould's sympathetic treatment of [[Richard Goldschmidt]],&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1976). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_hopeful-monsters.html "The Return of Hopeful Monsters,"] ''Natural History'' 86 (June/July): 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt; the controversial [[genetics|geneticist]] who advocated the idea of "[[hopeful monster]]s," led some biologists to conclude that Gould's punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1982). ''Growth of Biological Thought''. Harvard University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/mayr_macroevolutionary-diversity.pdf p. 617]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J.

''The Face That Demonstrates the Farce of Evolution''. Nashville, TN: Word Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta-qOuhtGkAC&amp;pg=PA40 pp. 40-45.]&lt;/ref&gt; In an often quoted remark, Gould stated, "Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]]. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are [[List of transitional fossils|abundant between larger groups]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as Fact and Theory,"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last, supporters of punctuated equilibrium generally place the figure between 50,000 and 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayala |first1=F. |date=2005 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/ayala_structure.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Theology and Science |doi=10.1080/14746700500039800 |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum evolution===
[[Quantum evolution]] was a controversial hypothesis advanced by [[Columbia University]] paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]], who was regarded by Gould as "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2007) ''Punctuated equilibrium''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new [[Family (biology)|families]], [[Order (biology)|orders]], and [[Class (biology)|classes]] of organisms.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. J. and F. J. Ayala (1995) [https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=4910 ''Tempo and mode in evolution: genetics and paleontology 50 years after Simpson''.] Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the [[species]] level.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977 /&gt; Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944 /&gt; Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a [[Synergy|synergistic]] interaction between [[genetic drift]] and a shift in the [[fitness landscape|adaptive fitness landscape]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1953). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/simpson_evolutionary-rates.html ''The Major Features of Evolution'']. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution.&lt;ref name="Simpson1944p206"&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5qucNebo-kC&amp;pg=PA205 pp. 205-206.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Major Features of Evolution'' Simpson stated, "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as [[Sewall Wright]] as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |date=1982 |title=Character change, speciation, and the higher taxa |journal=Evolution |doi=10.2307/2408092 |volume=56 |issue=3 |page=427 |url=http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828022050/http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1984) ''Tempo and Mode in Evolution''. Reprint. Columbia University Press, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings of gradualism===
Punctuated equilibrium is often portrayed to oppose the concept of [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]], when it is actually a form of gradualism.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 1996 p. 224-252"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., Chapter 9. (p. 224-252)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that "Most of our [[paleontology|paleontological colleagues]] missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about [[allopatric speciation]] or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our [[Population genetics|evolutionary colleagues]] also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales".&lt;ref name=Opus200/&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] dedicated a chapter in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding ''rates of change''. His first point is to argue that [[phyletic gradualism]] — understood in the sense that evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called "constant speedism" by Dawkins — is a "caricature of Darwinism"&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and "does not really exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 228. Dawkins' exception to this rule is the non-adaptive evolution observed in molecular evolution.&lt;/ref&gt; His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of "constant speedism" is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms "variable speedism". Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: "''discrete variable'' speedism" and "''continuously variable'' speedism". Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as "discrete variable speedists", and "in this respect they are genuinely radical."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. "Continuously variable speedists", on the other hand, advance that "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record,{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} in contrast to his earlier claim that "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R (1982) ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. London: Oxford University Press, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.

==Criticism==
[[Richard Dawkins]] regards the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record to document migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly occurred but  "probably gradually" elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observation of stasis and examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheetham |first1=Alan |authorlink1=Alan Cheetham |last2=Jackson |first2=Jeremy |last3=Hayek |first3=Lee-Ann |author3-link= Lee-Ann C.

Dawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been "oversold by some journalists",&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; but partly due to Eldredge and Gould's "later writings".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins contends that the hypothesis "does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "minor gloss," an "interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory," and "lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] is especially critical of Gould's presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel (1995). ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 282-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould responded to Dennett's claims in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 "Darwinian Fundamentalism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 12, pp. 34-37; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121332/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_pluralism.html "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 26, pp. 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his technical volume ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_structure.html "Punctuated Equilibrium's Threefold History."] ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 1006-1021.&lt;/ref&gt;

English professor Heidi Scott argues that Gould's talent for writing vivid prose, his use of metaphor, and his success in building a popular audience of nonspecialist readers altered the "climate of specialized scientific discourse" favorably in his promotion of punctuated equilibrium.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Heidi |date=2007 |title=Stephen Jay Gould and the Rhetoric of Evolutionary Theory |journal=Rhetoric Review |doi=10.1080/07350190709336705 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=120–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould's rhetorical skills.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Philosopher John Lyne and biologist Henry Howe believed punctuated equilibrium's success has much more to do with the nature of the geological record than the nature of Gould's rhetoric. They state, a "re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change."&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, John and Henry Howe "'Punctuated Equilibria': Rhetorical Dynamics of a Scientific Controversy". in Harris, R. A. ed. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGvK8pBsiSAC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science''.] Mahwah NJ: Hermagoras Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as "evolution by jerks",&lt;ref&gt;Turner, John (1984). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6idhDboGmZoC&amp;pg=PA34 "Why we need evolution by jerks."] ''New Scientist'' 101 (Feb. 9): 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
which reportedly prompted punctuationists to describe [[phyletic gradualism]] as "evolution by creeps."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. and Steven Rose, ed. (2007). ''The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darwin's theory==
The sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most [[species]]—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?|long been noted]], including by [[Charles Darwin]] who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1871). ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of [[catastrophism]] and [[progressive creationism]], which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of [[evolution]] in accordance with the [[gradualism]] promoted by his friend [[Charles Lyell]]. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 ''Essay'', "Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false."&lt;ref name=VQR&gt;Eldredge, Niles (2006) [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/ "Confessions of a Darwinist."] ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' 82 (Spring): 32-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' states that "Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian ''Lingula'' differs but little from the living species of this genus". ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'' is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=331 p. 313].&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth edition (1866) of ''On the Origin of Species'' Darwin wrote that "the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F387&amp;pageseq=583 p. 551].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin's conception of evolution.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;

According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, "peripheral isolates" are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, "''I can by no means agree'' ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements....  Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F387&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 pp. 120-121.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin's early thinking, as shown in his ''Essay'' of 1844. But by the time he wrote the ''Origin'' he had downplayed its importance.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt; He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms&amp;nbsp;... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species.

Thus punctuated equilibrium is incongruous with some of Darwin's ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;&lt;ref name="ComesOfAge"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink1=Stephen Jay Gould |last2=Eldredge |first2=Niles |authorlink2=Niles Eldredge |date=1993 |title=Punctuated equilibrium comes of age |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/366223a0 |pmid=8232582|volume=366 |issue=6452 |pages=223–227 |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_comes-of-age.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplemental modes of rapid evolution==
{{See also|Rapid modes of evolution}}
Recent work in [[developmental biology]] has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of [[morphogenesis|tissue morphogenesis]] that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume ''[[Origination of Organismal Form]]'' (MIT Press; 2003).

==Language change==
{{See also|Language change}}
In linguistics, [[R. M. W. Dixon]] has proposed a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1997). ''The rise and fall of languages'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with reference particularly to the prehistory of the [[indigenous languages of Australia]] and his objections to the proposed [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027295118|title=Australian Languages|last=|first=|date=2004-03-18|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027295118|editor-last=Bowern|editor-first=Claire|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1075/cilt.249|editor-last2=Koch|editor-first2=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, recent work using [[computational phylogenetics|computational phylogenetic]] methods claims to show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when [[language change|languages split from one another]], accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atkinson |first1=Quentin D. |last2=Meade |first2=Andrew |last3=Venditti |first3=Chris |last4=Greenhill |first4=Simon J. |last5=Pagel |first5=Mark |date=2008 |title=Languages Evolve in Punctuational Bursts |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.1149683 |pmid=18239118 |volume=319 |issue=5863 |page=588}}; Dan Dediu mail, Stephen C.

David |date=2008 |title=How Apollo Flew to the Moon |location=Chichester |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=978-0-387-71675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|387}} It is a numerical definition of a fixed orientation in space and is usually (but not always) defined with respect to the stars. It was used by the [[Apollo PGNCS|Apollo Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS)]] as a reference to which the gimbal-mounted platform at its core should be oriented. Every operation within the spacecraft that required knowledge of direction was carried out with respect to the orientation of the guidance platform, itself aligned according to a particular REFSMMAT.

During an Apollo flight, the REFSMMAT being used, and therefore the orientation of the guidance platform, would change as operational needs required it, but never during a guidance process—that is, one REFSMMAT might be in use from launch through Trans-Lunar Injection, another from TLI to Midpoint, but would not change during the middle of a burn or set of maneuvers.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|150}}

For example, it was considered good practice to have the spacecraft displays show some meaningful attitude value that would be easy to monitor during an important engine burn. Flight controllers at mission control in Houston would calculate what attitude the spacecraft had to be at for that burn and would devise a REFSMMAT that matched it in some way. Then, when it came time for the burn, if the spacecraft was in its correct attitude, the crew would see their 8-ball display a simple attitude that would be easy to interpret, allowing errors to be easily tracked and corrected.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|197}}

In the hallowed halls of mission control, [[Captain Refsmmat]] was a [[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]]-type character, first drawn by flight controller Ed Pavelka as the "ideal mission controller", as an aid to the esprit de corps within the mission control team.&lt;ref name="Woods" /&gt;{{rp|146}}

'''''Taking the piss''''' is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] term meaning to take liberties at the expense of others, or to be joking, or to be unreasonable. It is a shortening of the idiom '''taking the piss out of,''' which is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning to [[Parody|mock]], tease, joke, ridicule, or scoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Chris Roberts (author)|first=Chris |last=Roberts|title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme|publisher=Thorndike Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7862-8517-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with "taking a piss", which refers to the act of urinating. '''Taking the Mickey''' (Mickey Bliss, [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]]), '''taking the Mick''' or '''taking the Michael''' is another term for making fun of someone. These terms are most widely used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].

==Usage==
The term sometimes refers to a form of mockery in which the mocker exaggerates the other person's characteristics; pretending to take on his or her attitudes, etc., for the purpose of comedic effect at the expense of another.  This would be described as "taking the piss" out of that person, or "a piss-take". It may be also be used to refer to a ruse whereby a person is led to believe a plainly unbelievable fact for the purpose of ridicule of the subject, e.g. "Are you being serious?" "No, I'm just taking the piss."

The phrase is in common usage throughout British society, employed by headline writers in broadsheet gazettes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2212788,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Taking the Mickey out of Saatchi | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | date=18 November 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tabloids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=380769&amp;in_page_id=1773 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Are Jordan and Peter taking the Mickey? | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as colloquially. It is also used in English speaking countries such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/20/1050777165949.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Taking the Mickey | date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/to-mitigate-gibbs-outburst-is-simply-taking-the-mickey/2007/01/16/1168709752692.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=To mitigate Gibbs outburst is simply taking the Mickey | date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial usage, "taking the piss" is also used to refer to someone or something that makes a claim which is not in line with a recognised agreement e.g. an invoice that is double the quoted price with no explanation for the added charge could be said to "take the piss", or likewise if something consistently misses a deadline.

The term can also mean to take unfair advantage.  For example, if someone has a food [[buffet]] and one guest clearly takes more than their expected share.  It can also relate to an abuse of trust, such as "''You can use my 'phone, but don't take the piss!''", i.e. do not abuse my offer of assistance by making lengthy calls that will cost me a lot of money.  Equally, a wilfully unproductive employee could be described as "taking the piss" for accepting a wage while knowingly failing to deliver on their obligation, or an employer could be accused of "taking the piss" for making unreasonable requests of their employees, e.g. expecting them to do unpaid overtime.

==Origin==
"Take the piss" may be a reference to a related (and dated) idiomatic expression, ''piss-proud'', which is a vulgar pun referring to the [[Nocturnal penile tumescence|morning erections]] which happen when a man awakens at the end of a dream cycle (each about 90 minutes in length throughout the night) or may be caused by a full bladder pressing upon nerves that help affect erection.  This could be considered a 'false' erection, as its origin is physiological not sexual, so in a metaphoric sense, then, someone who is "piss-proud" would suffer from false pride, and ''taking the piss out of them'' refers to deflating this false pride, through disparagement or mockery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A753527 |title=The Origins and Common Usage of British Swear Words |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tak2.htm |title=Take the piss |accessdate=7 January 2011 |last=Quinion |first=Michael |work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge of the expression's metaphoric origin became lost on users, "taking the piss out of" came to be synonymous with disparagement or mockery itself, with less regard to the pride of the subject.

"Take the mickey" may be an abbreviated form of the [[Cockney rhyming slang]] "take the Mickey Bliss",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/344000.html |title=Take the Mickey |accessdate=30 January 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder }}&lt;/ref&gt; a euphemism for "take the piss." It has also been suggested that "mickey" is a contraction of "[[urination|micturition]],"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; in which case "take the micturition" would be a synonymous euphemism for "take the piss." The phrase has been noted since the 1930s.

===Alternative theory of origin===
One theory is that during the [[History of the British canal system|age of the canals]] in Britain, urine would be brought up the canals to the wool mills in Northern England (particularly to Yorkshire), as urine was used in the process of fixing dye to wool. This was particularly the case when dyeing items blue with [[Indigo dye|indigo]] or more traditionally with [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]], before [[synthetic dyes]] were invented or made commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |title=Taking the piss |publisher=Blog.dgwbirch.com |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130027/http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being in the business of transporting urine was much less lucrative than transporting wine, so when the boatmen were questioned what they were carrying they would lie and say "I'm taking wine" and the response would be "No, you're taking the piss" to express disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |title=Dying Art |publisher=History.uk.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051715/http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple for Peace''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Temple pour la Paix'') is a construction project of the congregation [[Vajradhara-Ling]] in [[Normandy]] to promote [[world peace]]. The cornerstone was laid in 2003 and construction started in 2010. This [[Temple]] will be built in the same style as the [[Samye]] monastery, the first temple built in [[Tibet]] that was founded by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705110245/http://www.kagyu-dzong.com/site/projets/projet.htm Les projets de Lama Gyourmé pour Vajradhara-Ling]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims of the Temple ==
The aims of the Temple for Peace is not only to share teachings of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] but also to welcome demonstrations linked to peace: symposia, [[Interfaith|inter-religious meetings]], expositions and performances. It will be a place to encounter and favor the exchanges between different schools of [[Buddhism]], as well as [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam|Moslem]], [[Judaism|Jews]], and other traditions such as those of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians of North America]] and [[Indigenous Australians]].  Meetings will be organized between wise representatives of these traditions, enabling a better knowledge of their diversity as well as common values: their contributions in building a better world, mutual tolerance and the respect of others, in particular through peace and [[non-violence]]. Conferences will gather recognized personalities working to promote peace such as [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureates]], women and men involved in [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] projects, religious dignitaries of different confessions, artists working to promote respect and tolerance between peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agoravox.fr/culture-loisirs/culture/article/festival-paix-et-lumiere-a-la-77458 Festival Paix et Lumière à la Pagode de Vincennes 26 et 27 juin 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis of the project ==
In 1995 and in 1998, [[Lama Gyurme]] visited [[Tibet]] in a pilgrimage and met [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje]], the 17th [[Karmapa]] at [[Tsurphu]]. He presented him his project for construction of a temple for peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vajradharaling.org/p_tp-descriptif3.php Genèse du projet "Temple pour la Paix"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907094829/http://vajradharaling.org/p_tp-descriptif3.php |date=2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authorization to construct the Temple was granted by the French authorities in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templepourlapaix.org/pages/index.php?langage=1&amp;idRubrique=2&amp;idCategorie=2 Historique du projet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928183846/http://www.templepourlapaix.org/pages/index.php?langage=1&amp;idRubrique=2&amp;idCategorie=2 |date=2009-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cornerstone]] was laid by [[Tenga Rinpoche]] on September 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf Dalaï Lama France 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727140515/http://www.oceandesagesse.org/doc/dossier_presse_FR.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}, see page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was consecrated by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] on August 14, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vajradharaling.org/_download/presse/dossiers/VDL_SSDL-2008.pdf Venue de sa sainteté le dalaï-lama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206054118/http://www.vajradharaling.org/_download/presse/dossiers/VDL_SSDL-2008.pdf |date=2008-12-06 }}, site de [[Vajradhara-Ling]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDet_-Lama-Gyourme-a-recu-le-Dalai-lama-a-Aubry-le-Panthou-_8618-785432_actu.Htm Lama Gyourmé a reçu le Dalaï-lama à Aubry-le-Panthou], Ouest-France, December 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; at this occasion, the Dalai Lama delivered a speech on peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/monde/story/22641770 Le dalaï lama devrait attirer les foules en France], Associated Press, August 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction started in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franco-ecossaise.asso.fr/les%20camembertises%202010.pdf Anniversaire du centre tibétain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705062855/http://www.franco-ecossaise.asso.fr/les%20camembertises%202010.pdf |date=2010-07-05 }}, May 2010, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temple architecture ==
The Temple will have a surface area of {{formatnum:3600}} m² on five levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhaline.net/spip.php?article1488 Paix et lumière, festival au profit de la construction du Temple pour la Paix créé à l’initiative de Lama Gyourmé (26 - 27 juin)], Buddhaline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peace and Light Festival ==
Since 2006, each year at [[Kagyu-Dzong]], the Peace and Light Festival was started to support the construction of the Temple. It includes [[art exhibition]] and performances, and takes place in the [[Pagode de Vincennes]]. In 2008, it included a concert by Lama Gyurme and [[Jean-Philippe Rykiel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agoravox.fr/article.php3?id_article=40423 Visite du Karmapa aux Etats-Unis, portes ouvertes à Paris du Temple pour la Paix qui lui est lié]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, songs by Lama Gyurme were presented by the French actress [[Véronique Jannot]], while Tshering Wangdu&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachel.guidoni.free.fr/page1.htm Biographie]&lt;/ref&gt; also gave a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templepourlapaix.org/paix-lumiere/index.php Festival Paix et Lumière] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901053551/http://www.templepourlapaix.org/paix-lumiere/index.php |date=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13952">{{About|the thermal design envelope of microprocessors|the general concept|power rating}}

The '''thermal design power''' ('''TDP'''), sometimes called '''thermal design point''', is the maximum amount of [[heat]] generated by a computer chip or component (often a [[CPU]], [[GPU]] or [[system on a chip]]) that the [[computer cooling|cooling system]] in a computer is designed to [[dissipation|dissipate]] under any workload.  

The TDP is typically not the largest amount of heat the CPU could ever generate ([[Power rating|peak power]]), such as by running a [[power virus]], but rather the maximum amount of heat that it would generate when running "real [[application software|applications]]". This ensures the computer will be able to handle essentially all applications without exceeding its thermal envelope, or requiring a cooling system for the maximum theoretical power (which would cost more but in favor of extra headroom for processing power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = In Intel's case, a specified chip's TDP has less to do with the amount of power a chip needs to use (or can use) and more to do with the amount of power the computer's fan and heatsink need to be able to dissipate while the chip is under sustained load. Actual power usage can be higher or (much) lower than TDP, but the figure is intended to give guidance to engineers designing cooling solutions for their products.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources state that the peak power for a microprocessor is usually 1.5 times the TDP rating.&lt;ref name="HennessyPatterson2012"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the TDP is a conventional figure while its measurement methodology has been the subject of controversy.  In particular, until around 2006 [[AMD]] used to report the maximum power draw of its processors as TDP, but [[Intel]] changed this practice with the introduction of its [[Conroe (microprocessor)|Conroe]] family of processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar but more recent controversy has involved the power TDP measurements of some [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] Y-series processors, with which Intel has introduced a new metric called ''scenario design power'' (SDP).&lt;ref name="anandtech-6655"&gt;{{Cite web

== Overview ==
{{See also|CPU power dissipation}}

The TDP of a CPU has been underestimated in some cases, leading to certain real applications (typically strenuous, such as video encoding or games) causing the CPU to exceed its specified TDP and resulting in overloading the computer's cooling system.  In this case, CPUs either cause a system failure (a "therm-trip") or throttle their speed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://ixbtlabs.com/articles2/p4-throttling/
 | title = Testing Thermal Throttling in Pentium 4 CPUs with Northwood and Prescott cores
 | date = 2004-03-26 | accessdate = 2013-12-21
 | author = Stanislav Garmatyuk | website = ixbtlabs.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern processors will cause a therm-trip only upon a catastrophic cooling failure, such as a no longer operational fan or an incorrectly mounted heatsink.

For example, a [[laptop]]'s CPU cooling system may be designed for a 20&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]] TDP, which means that it can dissipate up to 20&amp;nbsp;watts of heat without exceeding the maximum [[junction temperature]] for the laptop's CPU.  A cooling system can do this using an active cooling method (e.g. forced convection) such as a [[Computer fan|fan]], or any of the three passive cooling methods: [[convection]], [[thermal radiation]] or [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. Typically, a combination of these methods is used.

Since safety margins and the definition of what constitutes a real application vary among [[Integrated device manufacturer|manufacturers]], TDP values between different manufacturers cannot be accurately compared.  For example, while a processor with a TDP of 100&amp;nbsp;W will almost certainly use more [[electric power|power]] at full load than a processor with a 10&amp;nbsp;W TDP from the same manufacturer, it may or may not use more power than a processor from a different manufacturer that has a 90&amp;nbsp;W TDP. Additionally, TDPs are often specified for families of processors, with the low-end models usually using significantly less power than those at the high end of the family.

The dynamic power consumed by a switching circuit is approximately proportional to the square of the voltage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== {{Anchor|VARIABLE}}Variable TDP ==
TDP specifications for some processors may allow them to work under multiple different power levels, depending on the usage scenario, available cooling capacities and desired power consumption.  Technologies that provide such variable TDPs include [[Intel]]'s ''configurable TDP'' (cTDP) and ''scenario design power'' (SDP), and [[AMD]]'s ''TDP power cap''.

=== {{Anchor|NDP|CTDP|TDPPC}}Configurable TDP ===
''Configurable TDP'' (''cTDP''), also known as ''programmable TDP'' or ''TDP power cap'', is an operating mode of later generations of Intel mobile processors ({{As of|2014|January|lc=yes}}) and AMD processors ({{As of|2012|June|lc=yes}}) that allows adjustments in their TDP values.  By modifying the processor behavior and its performance levels, power consumption of a processor can be changed altering its TDP at the same time.  That way, a processor can operate at higher or lower performance levels, depending on the available cooling capacities and desired power consumption.&lt;ref name="intel-mh-lines"&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Configurable TDP (cTDP) and Low-Power Mode (LPM) form a design vector where the processor behavior and package TDP are  dynamically adjusted to a desired system performance and power envelope. [...] With cTDP, the processor is now capable of altering the maximum sustained power with an alternate guaranteed frequency. Configurable TDP allows operation in situations where extra cooling is available or situations where a cooler and quieter mode of operation is desired.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69&amp;ndash;72}}&lt;ref name="phoronix-amd-kaveri"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel processors that support cTDP provide three operating modes:&lt;ref name="intel-mh-lines" /&gt;{{rp|71&amp;ndash;72}}
* ''Nominal TDP''{{snd}} this is the processor's rated frequency and TDP.
* ''cTDP down''{{snd}} when a cooler or quieter mode of operation is desired, this mode specifies a lower TDP and lower guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.
* ''cTDP up''{{snd}} when extra cooling is available, this mode specifies a higher TDP and higher guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.

For example, some of the [[Haswell (microarchitecture)#MOBILE|mobile Haswell]] processors support cTDP up, cTDP down, or both modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== {{Anchor|SDP}}Scenario design power ===
Intel's description of ''Scenario Design Power (SDP)'': "SDP is an additional thermal reference point meant to represent thermally relevant device usage in real-world environmental scenarios. It balances performance and power requirements across system workloads to represent real-world power usage. "&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Scenario design power'' (''SDP'') is not an additional power state of a processor. The SDP only states the average power consumption of a processor using a certain mix of benchmark programs to simulate "real-world" scenarios".&lt;ref name="anandtech-6655" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = Ars Technica
 | quote = If the CPU needs to work hard for an extended period of time and the laptop gets warmer, it will slowly ramp down its speed until it's operating at its stated TDP. [...] There are two OEM-configurable "power level" states that define how quick the CPU can be in these situations: PL2 tells the processor how much power it's allowed to use when it needs a short burst of speed, and PL1 defines how quickly the processor can run under sustained load. [...] This is at the heart of what Intel is doing with the Y-series processors: their maximum TDP has been lowered four watts, from 17 to 13. Intel is also validating them for use at two lower PL1 values: 10 watts and 7&amp;nbsp;watts. This is where the marketing we discussed earlier comes in—rather than keeping these values under the covers as it has so far been content to do, Intel has taken that lowest value, put it on its product pages, and called it SDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A '''top-lit updraft gasifier''' (also known as a '''TLUD''') is a [[micro-kiln]] used to produce charcoal, especially [[biochar]], and heat for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biochar-Producing Stoves to Benefit Climate, Health, and Soil|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLUD [[pyrolysis|pyrolyzes]] organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly [[carbon]] as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create [[terra preta]].

Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TLUD|url=http://www.drtlud.com/tlud-technology/history/|publisher=Dr TLUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a [[rocket stove]] in more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.

== The Technology ==

A TLUD gasifier stove &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioChar Foundation|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers.

The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet.

The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model.

Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up.

The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas. 

YouTube has many instructional videos, with further explanation on other websites.

[[File:Trinity House, Kirkgate Leith.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Kirkgate, Leith]]
[[File:Trinity House Maritime Museum - geograph.org.uk - 626296.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Leith]]
'''Trinity House''', 99 Kirkgate, is a category A [[listed building]]&lt;ref name= "historic scotland"&gt;[http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:27834 Historic Scotland - Listed Buildings - 99 New Kirkgate, Trinity House]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which was a [[guild hall]], [[customs house]], and centre for maritime administration and [[poor relief]]. In the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]] it also served as an [[almshouse]] and [[Hospital#Medieval Europe|hospital]]. Now in [[Historic Scotland|state care]], it houses a [[maritime museum]].

Trinity House was the headquarters of the Incorporation of Masters and Mariners, a [[Guild|trade incorporation]] and charitable organisation founded in the 14th century when the shipowners and shipmasters of Leith formed a [[Fraternity]] (from which the name, ''Trinity'', may derive). The present Trinity House is a Category A [[Listed building|listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] house, designed by [[Thomas Brown (architect)|Thomas Brown]] and built in 1816-8, using the existing basement and vaults of the former Trinity House and mariners' hospital of 1555.&lt;ref name= "historic scotland" /&gt;

Concerned to improve safety at sea, Trinity House established the first formal [[Seamanship|nautical training]] in the country and licensed [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s for the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and around the [[Geography of Scotland|Scottish coast]]. By collecting Licht Money (light money), by the 17th century they were maintaining primitive coal-fired lights in the Forth. In the 19th century, Trinity House was involved in the planning and funding of new and more reliable [[lighthouse]]s that took advantage of improvements in technology. These included the [[Bell Rock lighthouse]], [[Fidra lighthouse]] and the [[Isle of May lighthouse]].

The Masters and Mariners invested in land, which became known as Trinity Mains, near the village of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]]. This land later developed into a suburb of Leith and is now the modern-day district of [[Trinity, Edinburgh|Trinity]].

The medieval Incorporation served as a blueprint for the establishment of Trinity Houses in other maritime centres, including Dundee, [[Hull Trinity House|Hull]], [[Trinity House, London|London]] and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].

==History==
[[File:Convening Room Trinity House, Leith N wall.JPG|thumb|Convening Room Trinity House]]
The Masters and Mariners of the Trinity House in the Kirkgate was the oldest and wealthiest of the [[trade guild]]s of Leith. The guilds were divided into four groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/11.htm The Story of Leith - The Trade Guilds of Leith]&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sea captain|skipper]]s and [[Sailor|mariner]]s of the Trinity House
# [[Maltman|maltmen]], [[brewer]]s, and [[sled]]ders or [[cart]]ers
# [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and meal men (''[[Cereal|corn merchants]]'')
# traffickers (''[[merchant]]s''), and all other gentlemen and residents of Leith not members of any of the other corporations

In 1380 [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] granted the Incorporation of Master and Mariners of Leith the right to levy a [[Duty (economics)|duty]], called prime gilt, of 12 [[Scottish coinage|pennies]] on each [[ton]] of goods landed at Leith. An additional voluntary contribution, called crown money, was also collected. Trade was largely conducted over the [[North Sea]], with the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Baltic region]]s, the [[Low Countries]] and France. The funds raised by the prime gilt and crown money were then used for the [[Poor relief|relief]] of the sick, the poor and the widows and orphans of lost or captured mariners; and to care for aged mariners.

In 1555 the Incorporation had sufficient funds to build a hospital at the Kirkgate. The basement of this building survives under the current Trinity House.

Following a series of disputes over payments, in 1566 [[Mary Queen of Scots]] confirmed the right of the Incorporation to collect payments: ratifying "the gift, foundation, erection and institution of the hospital and of the prime gilt". Refusal to pay would result in the [[confiscation]] of sails and anchor.

In 1680, funded by fees and by a levy on Leith shipmasters, the Masters and Mariners appointed a professor to teach the mathematics of navigation to the sons and apprentices of shipmasters. This training for future officers was subsequently extended across Scotland.

On 29 June 1797 the Corporation of the Trinity House of Leith was granted a [[royal charter]].

As a result of the requirement for formal qualifications stipulated in the [[Merchant Seamen Act 1844]], in 1855 Trinity House and other Leith organisations founded the Leith Navigational School (also called the Government Navigation School), based at a room at [[St Ninian's Church, Leith|St Ninian's Church]] (also called the Mariners' Church), on Commercial Street. In 1903 Leith Navigation School came under the control of the [[Scottish Education Department]], and the name was changed to [[Leith Nautical College]] (since merged to become part of [[Jewel &amp; Esk College]], which in 2012 merged to become [[Edinburgh College]]).

Prime gilt was abolished in 1862, so Trinity House had to depend on property income to meet pension payments.

Currently Trinity House is in the care of [[Historic Environment Scotland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">The skull and bones of a man buried between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago on [[San Miguel Island]], in California's [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]], were exposed by beach erosion and discovered and preserved in 2005 by [[University of Oregon]] archaeologists. The remains were dated by way of radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts which had been intentionally buried with him. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man's DNA, though increasingly better testing techniques and methods became available and were utilized over the 12 years that passed after his original discovery. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on resolution of the precedent-setting [[Kennewick Man]] case from Washington State. Analysis of the bones indicated that he was in his forties when he died, and had spent time some distance east of what is now the Santa Barbara coastal region. Under procedures in accordance with the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), in May, 2018, they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe, for reburial on the island. The [[Chumash people]] had long occupied the island before the arrival of the first European explorers, and the find was given the place name of the island in the [[Chumash language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/special-reports/outdoors/2018/06/13/ancient-remains-discovered-reburied-san-miguel-island-tuqan-man-channel-islands-santa-ynez-chumash/670609002/ Tuqan Man, human remains buried 10,000 years ago, found on the Channel Islands], ''[[Ventura County Star]]'', Cheri Carlson, June 13, 2018.

Archaeological research has shown that San Miguel Island was first settled by humans at least 12,000 years ago, when San Miguel was still part of the larger Santarosae Island that connected the northern Channel Islands when sea levels were lower near the end of the Last Glacial period. Because the northern Channel Islands have not been connected to the adjacent mainland in recent geological history, the Paleo-Indians who first settled the island clearly had boats and other maritime technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Erlandson, J.M., T.C.

Science 441:1181-1185.&lt;/ref&gt; San Miguel was occupied by the ancestors of today's [[Chumash people]] for many millennia. They had developed a complex and rich maritime culture based on ocean fishing, hunting, and gathering. They called the island Tuquan in the Chumash language. For many centuries, they built and used sophisticated canoes, called [[tomol]]s, made from sewn planks caulked with [[asphaltum]] (bitumen). In tomols, they fished and hunted in island waters and participated in active trade with their neighbors on the other islands and the mainland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">The '''USC Center for Visual Anthropology''' ('''CVA''') is a center located at the [[University of Southern California]]. It is dedicated to the field of [[visual anthropology]], incorporating visual modes of expression in the academic discipline of anthropology.  It does so in conjunction with faculty in the anthropology department through five types of activities: training, research and analysis of visual culture, production of visual projects, archiving and collecting, and the sponsorship of conferences and film festivals. It offers a B.A.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dornsife.usc.edu/anth/undergraduate/ Anthropology: Undergraduate Degree Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; and an MVA&lt;ref&gt;[https://dornsife.usc.edu/anth/masters-in-visual-anthropology/ Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; in Visual Anthropology.

==History==
The CVA was founded and directed by Ira Abrams&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.temple.edu/~ruby/ruby/iwf.html The Professionalization of Visual Anthropology in the United States - The 1960s and 1970s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idyllwildarts.org/workshop-q10358-c10329-Faculty_Bios.aspx Faculty Bios]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with  [[Barbara Myerhoff]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://college.usc.edu/news/stories/634/legends-asch-and-myerhoff-inspire-a-new-generation-of-visual-ant/ Legends Asch and Myerhoff Inspire A New Generation of Visual Anthropologists &gt; News &gt; USC College]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Asch]] took over as director of the CVA in 1983. In 1984, he collaborated with the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] to create the MAVA degree (Master of Arts in Visual Anthropology), a 2-3 year terminal Masters program unique in its emphasis on both textual and visual media (film and photography) as components of an academically grounded research project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Asch served as director of the CVA until his death in 1994. In 2001, the MAVA program was merged into a ''Certificate in Visual Anthropology'' given alongside the Ph.D. in Anthropology. For a number of years, the CVA served as the west coast venue for the  [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.usc.edu/anth/html/cva.html Center for Visual Anthropology: USC Department of Anthropology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127144325/http://college.usc.edu/anth/html/cva.html |date=2009-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/186.html Filming Culture: Nigeria, Korea And Beyond Margaret Mead Ethnographic Film Festival Travels To The University, Bringing Two Videos By Usc Visual Anthropology Graduates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524112645/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/186.html |date=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new one year version of the Masters of Arts in Visual Anthropology was established in 2008, which focuses on the production of a half-hour ethnographic documentary over a twelve month period.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Susan 2009 "Legends Asch and Myerhoff Inspire A New Generation of Visual Anthropologists", Daily Trojan&lt;/ref&gt;  Over thirty new ethnographic documentaries have already been produced in this new program, and many of them are now in distribution and shown at film festivals.

The university is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division III [[Northwest Conference]] and was featured in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''. Willamette's mascot is the [[binturong|bearcat]] and old gold and cardinal are the school colors. Approximately 2,800 students are enrolled at Willamette between the graduate and undergraduate programs.&lt;ref name="willamette.edu"/&gt; The school employs over 200 full-time professors on the {{convert|69|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus located across the street from the [[Oregon State Capitol]].

Originally named the [[Oregon Institute]], the school was an unaffiliated outgrowth of the [[Methodist Mission]]. The name was changed to Wallamet University in 1852, followed by the current spelling in 1870. Willamette founded the first medical school and law school in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the second half of the 19th century. In the 20th century, the school started a [[sister school]] relationship with [[Tokyo International University]] and began competing in intercollegiate athletics.

Willamette's undergraduate programs exist within the school's College of Liberal Arts. The school was rated 82nd among American liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Liberal Arts Colleges -  Willamette University |publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/willamette-3227/overall-rankings |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of the graduate programs is the [[Willamette University College of Law|College of Law]], founded in 1883 and currently located in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center.

==History==
The university was founded as the [[Oregon Institute]] by the missionary [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]], who had arrived in what was then known as the [[Oregon Country]] in 1834 and had founded the Indian Manual Labor Institute for the education of the local [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Lee requested additional support for his mission, and received 53 additional volunteers in 1839, who arrived on the ship ''[[Lausanne (ship)|Lausanne]]''. After a series of meetings in Lee's home, the by-laws were adopted and board of trustees elected and the institute was officially established on February 1, 1842. The Oregon Institute officially opened on August 13, 1844 with a total of five students and one teacher, Mrs. [[Chloe Clark Willson|Chloe Clarke Willson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1834-1899.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1834 - 1899 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee served as the first President of the Board of Trustees, followed by [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]] after Lee's death in 1845. Leslie would serve until his death in 1869.&lt;ref name=wu&gt;Gatke, Robert Moulton. 1943. ''Chronicles of Willamette, the pioneer university of the West''.

[[File:Eaton Hall from OSC.JPG|left|thumb|[[Eaton Hall (Oregon)|Eaton Hall]] built in 1909]]
The original building of the institute was a three-story frame structure first occupied in 1844. At the time, it was one of the largest structures in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It housed the first session of the state legislature to meet in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] after the capital was moved there in 1851. The building burned down in 1877. In 1867, a new brick building was finished to house the school and named University Hall.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; The building was renamed as [[Waller Hall]] in 1912 to honor the Reverend [[Alvin F. Waller]], and is now the oldest university building west of the [[Mississippi River]] still in use.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; The first president was [[Francis S. Hoyt]], who served in that position from 1853 until 1860 and was replaced by [[Thomas Milton Gatch]] who is the only president of the school to serve as president two different times.&lt;ref name=presidents&gt;[http://www.willamette.edu/about/president/past/index.html Past Presidents.] Willamette University. Retrieved on September 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the institution was changed to "Wallamet University" in 1852. The following year, the [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] granted a charter to the university. The first graduate was Emily J. York, who received a degree as Mistress of English Literature in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/about/history/highlights_1834-1899.html|title=About: History of Willamette: 1834 - 1899 {{!}} Willamette University|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the university established the first [[Willamette University School of Medicine|school of medicine]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=archive&gt;Cowan, Ron.

In December 1941, the university's football team traveled to Hawaii to play the [[University of Hawaii]]. Many students accompanied the team by passenger ship to [[Oahu]]. The game was played was on December 6.

The {{convert|69|acre|adj=on}} campus is directly south of the [[Oregon State Capitol]], affording students access to internships in the institutions of [[Government of Oregon|Oregon government]]. Much of downtown Salem, including the Capitol, is on land once owned by the university. Railroad tracks are located directly east of the school, with the [[Salem (Amtrak station)|Salem Amtrak Station]] near the southeastern edge of campus.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; South of the school is [[Salem Hospital (Oregon)|Salem Hospital]], with [[Bush's Pasture Park]] and the school's [[McCulloch Stadium]] opposite the hospital.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

Willamette's core area lies between State Street on the north, Bellevue Street on the south, Winter Street to the west, and 12th Street on the east.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; On the west side of Winter Street lie the university's graduate programs in business and law.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.willamette.edu/map/campus_map.pdf|title=Willamette University Campus Map|date=December 1, 2008|publisher=Willamette University|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional school properties outside of the core area are the [[Hallie Ford Museum of Art]], the [[Oregon Civic Justice Center]], the Tokyo International University of America campus, and several residential buildings.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Willamette owns several other properties along State Street west of the main campus.&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; The school plans on redeveloping portions of the west end of campus in order to better tie the campus to downtown Salem.&lt;ref name="plan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan blurs boundaries of Willamette U, Salem|last=Cowan|first=Ron|date=January 8, 2006|work=Statesman Journal|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic buildings on campus include [[Eaton Hall (Oregon)|Eaton Hall]] and Smullin/Walton Hall, which are primarily used by humanities departments. Science classes are generally held in the Collins and Olin buildings. Willamette's music program is housed by the G. Herbert Smith Auditorium and Fine Arts building, as well as the Mary Stuart Rogers auditorium. Administrative offices are found in the Putnam University Center and [[Waller Hall]], Willamette's oldest building. Waller Hall was built using bricks made of clay from the campus quad.

In addition to Greek housing, eleven residence halls exist on the Willamette campus. Undergraduate students are under contract to live on campus for two years, after which they may move into private residence or one of the university's apartment complexes. [[Lausanne Hall]], originally home of the university's Women's College, is now one of the university's undergraduate dormitories. The building commemorates the ship that brought the reinforcements to Lee in 1839. York Hall commemorates the university's first graduate.

The Mill Stream runs through the middle of the campus. Starting across 12th Street and flowing through the length of the campus, it passes by the [[Martha Springer Botanical Garden]], the [[Mark O. Hatfield Library|Hatfield Library]], Hudson Hall, the University Center, Smith Auditorium and Goudy Commons. This artificial stream, commonly referred to as the Mill Stream, was once known as the Mill Race. It forms a "W" shape when viewed from the University Center. Biology and environmental science classes utilize the Mill Stream as an authentic research venue. As part of the freshman matriculation ceremony, new students place a lit candle into the Mill Stream and watch it float downstream.

On-campus athletics facilities are located in the southeast portion of the campus. These include a soccer field, tennis courts, and the Sparks Center.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Softball, football, and baseball stadiums are located outside of the main campus.

===Greek life===
There are five fraternities and three sororities at Willamette. The sororities are [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Phi]]. Alpha Chi Omega and Pi Beta Phi have their own houses located along sorority row on Mill Street. The fraternities at Willamette are [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], and [[Sigma Chi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willamette.edu/offices/osa/greek/index.html|title=Student Activities: Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life|website=willamette.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek life at Willamette began in the 1920s with the foundation of several local fraternities and sororities. In 1942, G. Herbert Smith, a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]], became President of Willamette, and invited national fraternities and sororities onto campus. The local fraternities were soon converted into national fraternities and sororities. Pi Beta Phi became the first national sorority at Willamette in 1944, and Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta were installed in 1947. At its peak, there were six fraternities and five sororities at Willamette.

Two other sororities, [[Chi Omega]] and [[Alpha Phi]], and the fraternity [[Delta Tau Delta]], used to have chapters at Willamette.  In the mid-1990s, Delta Tau Delta lost its charter. The two sororities lost their charters after their move to sorority row. Chi Omega was transformed into a multicultural oriented residence known as WISH (Willamette International Studies House). In the spring of 2014, Alpha Phi accepted an invitation from the university's Panhellenic Council to reorganize their chapter on Willamette's campus. In the fall of 2014, Beta Theta Pi began recolonization of its chapter on Willamette's campus with the consent of the university's Inter-Fraternity council.
