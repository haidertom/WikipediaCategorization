'''American studies''' or '''American civilization''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] of scholarship that examines [[History of the United States|American history]], [[Society of the United States|society]], and [[Culture of the United States|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Theories of American Culture, Theories of American Studies | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ym7FW6rNnoC&amp;pg=PR9| isbn= 3-8233-4173-1 | publisher= Gunter Narr Verlag | year= 2003| author=Winfried Fluck| accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traditionally incorporates the study of history, [[American literature|literature]], and [[critical theory]], but also welcomes research methods from a variety of other disciplines.

Scholarship in American studies has most often concerned the [[United States]]. In the past decades, however, it has also sought to study other nations and territories in the Americas, as well as American interactions with countries across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowe|first1=Juan Carlos|title=Transnationalism and American Studies|url=http://www.theasa.net/project_eas_online/page/project_eas_online_eas_featured_article/|website=American Studies Association|publisher=American Studies Association|accessdate=2015-09-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916062345/http://www.theasa.net/project_eas_online/page/project_eas_online_eas_featured_article/|archivedate=2015-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects studied within the field are varied, but often examine the histories of American communities, ideologies, or cultural productions. Examples might include topics in American social movements, literature, media, tourism, folklore, and intellectual history.

Fields studying specific American ethnic or racial groups are considered to be both independent of and included within the broader American studies discipline. This includes [[African American studies]], [[Latin American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[American Indian studies]], and others.

==Founding notions==
[[Vernon Louis Parrington]] is often cited as the founder of American studies for his three-volume ''Main Currents in American Thought'', which combines the methodologies of [[literary criticism]] and historical research; it won the [[1928 Pulitzer Prize]]. In the introduction to ''Main Currents in American Thought'', Parrington described his field:

:I have undertaken to give some account of the genesis and development in American letters of certain germinal ideas that have come to be reckoned traditionally American&amp;mdash;how they came into being here, how they were opposed, and what influence they have exerted in determining the form and scope of our characteristic ideals and institutions. In pursuing such a task, I have chosen to follow the broad path of our political, economic, and social development, rather than the narrower [[Belles-lettres|belletristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parrington|first1=Vernon Louis|title=Main Currents In American Thought Volume One 1620-1800 The Colonial Mind|date=1927 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc|page=ix|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.53378/2015.53378.Main-Currents-In-American-Thought#page/n9/mode/2up |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "broad path" that Parrington describes formed a scholastic course of study for [[Henry Nash Smith]], who received a Ph.D. from [[Harvard]]'s interdisciplinary program in "History and American Civilization" in 1940, setting an academic precedent for present-day American Studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsm76|title = Texas State Historical Association|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The first signature methodology of American studies was the "[[myth and symbol]]" approach, developed in such foundational texts as Henry Nash Smith's ''Virgin Land'' in 1950 and [[Leo Marx]]'s ''[[The Machine in the Garden]]'' in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Myth and symbol scholars claimed to find certain recurring themes throughout American texts that served to illuminate a unique American culture. Later scholars such as [[Annette Kolodny]] and [[Alan Trachtenberg]] re-imagined the myth and symbol approach in light of multicultural studies.

Beginning in the 1960s and 70s, these earlier approaches were criticized for continuing to promote the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]&amp;mdash;the notion that the US has had a special mission and virtue that makes it unique among nations. Several generations of American Studies scholars have critiqued this ethnocentric view, and have focused critically on issues of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and both transnational and international concerns.

Institutionally, in the last decade the American Studies Association has reflected the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the field, creating particularly strong connections to other interdisciplines such as ethnic studies, gender studies, cultural studies and post- or de-colonial studies. Environmental perspectives, in ascendance in related fields, such as literature and history, have not penetrated the mainstream of American studies scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10231602/Necrocracy_in_America_American_Studies_Begins_to_Address_Fossil_Fuels_and_Climate_Change |title=Necrocracy in America: American Studies Begins to Address Fossil Fuels and Climate Change &amp;#124; Matthew Schneider-Mayerson |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme of the field in recent years has been internationalization{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}&amp;mdash;the recognition that much vital scholarship about the US and its relations to the wider global community has been and is being produced outside the United States.

==Outside the United States==
Following [[World War II]] and during the [[Cold War]], the U.S. government promoted the study of the United States in several European countries, helping to endow chairs in universities and institutes in American history, politics and literature in the interests of [[cultural diplomacy]].  Many scholars and governments in Europe also recognized the need to study the U.S. The field has become especially prominent in Britain and Germany. The [[British Association for American Studies]] was founded in 1955, and is a constituent member of the [[European Association for American Studies]].

European centres for American studies include the [[Center for American Studies]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] and most notably the [[John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies]] in Berlin, Germany. Other centers for American Studies in Germany include the Bavarian America-Academy, the [[University of Munich]], the [[Heidelberg Center for American Studies]] (HCA) and the Center for North American Studies (Zentrum für Nordamerikaforschung or ZENAF) at [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Graduate studies in the field of North American Studies can also be undertaken at the [[University of Cologne]], which works together in joint partnership with the North American Studies program at the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamericanstudies.de/ |title=Home |publisher=Northamericanstudies.de |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Studies Leipzig program at the [[University of Leipzig]] offers both BA and MA degrees and is known for the graduate journal ''[[aspeers]]''. Founded in 1992, the Center for American Studies at the [[University of Southern Denmark]] now offers a graduate program in American Studies. In the [[Netherlands]] the [[University of Groningen]] and the [[Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen]] offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American Studies. The [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[University of Leiden]] and the [[University of Utrecht]] only offer a graduate program in American Studies. Both the [[University of Sussex]] and the [[University of Nottingham]] in England offer both a number of postgraduate and undergraduate programs. In [[Sweden]], the Swedish Institute for North American Studies at [[Uppsala University]] offers a minor in American studies. In [[Slovakia]], the [[University of Presov]] and [[Pavol Jozef Safarik University]] offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American Studies combined with British Studies.  The Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library also offers a range of events and fellowships, as well as promoting the American collections held at the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/americas/|title=American Collections blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's main center for American studies is the [[Institute for US and Canadian Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], founded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the Middle East, the oldest American Studies program is the American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307193645/http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/ |archivedate=2009-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Bahrain]] in Sakhir.  Founded in 1998, the UOB ASC celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/tenth%20anniversary.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001011305/http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/tenth%20anniversary.htm |date=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established as a university minor, the ASC currently offers over 20 different courses for students, heralds weekly movies in its ASC Theater, regularly hosts diverse speakers, and sponsors gatherings and excursions for ASC students. There is a new American Studies program at the [[University of Tehran]], Iran. The new program, offered at the Faculty of World Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fws.ut.ac.ir|title=دانشکده مطالعات جهان|author=|date=|website=دانشکده مطالعات جهان}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multidisciplinary MA program focusing on American culture, politics, history and ethnicity.

In Oceania, the [[University of Canterbury]] in [[Christchurch]] New Zealand operated a full undergraduate and graduate American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/amst/|title=College of Arts - School of Humanities and Creative Arts - University of Canterbury - New Zealand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program until 2012, and in Australia, a postgraduate program in US Studies is run by the [[United States Studies Centre]] at the University of Sydney.

In Canada, the [[University of Alberta]] has the [[Alberta Institute for American Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanstudies.ualberta.ca/ |title=Home - University of Alberta |publisher=Americanstudies.ualberta.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222173722/http://www.americanstudies.ualberta.ca/ |archive-date=2015-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Western Ontario]] has a Centre for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.uwo.ca/ |title=CAS Main page - Western University |publisher=Cas.uwo.ca |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has both an undergraduate and master's program in American Studies, with specializations at the graduate level in American Cultural Studies, and Canadian-American Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.uwo.ca/graduate/grad_program_information.html |title=Program Information - CAS - Western University |publisher=CAS |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[York University]] offers an undergraduate program in United States Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/us-studies |title=United States Studies &amp;#124; Future Students &amp;#124; York University |publisher=Futurestudents.yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, due to the lack of communication between China and the United States since the communist party took up the power in 1949, the Chinese recognition of the U.S. was still limited to the communist political propaganda of the Cold War at the time when the two countries established the diplomatic relationship. Therefore, since the Sino-U.S. relationship was normalized in 1979, various research centers have been founded within Chinese universities in order to meet up to the needs of understanding the U.S. Thus, most of the prestigious American Studies centers in China established around 1980s, such as American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110013928/http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/ |archivedate=2014-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Beijing Foreign Studies University]]) in 1979, the Institute of American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ias.cass.cn|title=中国社会科学院美国研究所|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Chinese Academy of Social Science]]) in 1981, Center For American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.fudan.edu.cn|title=复旦大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Fudan University]]) in 1985, American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.pku.edu.cn/Pages/Default.aspx?id=b666eff9-c079-462e-a492-9a60f2bd7cfe |title=北京大学美国研究中心 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011622/http://www.asc.pku.edu.cn/Pages/Default.aspx?id=b666eff9-c079-462e-a492-9a60f2bd7cfe |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Peking University]]) in 1980,Center for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://cas.tongji.edu.cn{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tongji University]]), American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascscu.scu.edu.cn|title=四川大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sichuan University]]) in 1985, [[Hopkins-Nanjing Center|Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies]] in 1986,  American Social and Cultural Studies Center ([[China Foreign Affairs University]]) and Center for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flold.ecnu.edu.cn/myzx/About_Us.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129012354/http://www.flold.ecnu.edu.cn/myzx/About_Us.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[East China Normal University]]) in 2004. These centers do not have undergraduate programs. Based on the requirement of the curriculum setup of the China Department of Education, these centers only have graduate programs. In addition, there are also scholarly journals, such as ''American Studies Quarterly'',&lt;ref&gt;http://qk.cass.cn/mgyj/set{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; up in 1987 and organized by both the Institute of American Studies of Academy of Social Science and the Chinese Association of American Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ias.cass.cn/zhmgxuehui/zc.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030155/http://ias.cass.cn/zhmgxuehui/zc.asp |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }} and&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fudan American Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.fudan.edu.cn/far.php|title=复旦大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Center of American Studies of Fudan University.

The American Studies in the U.S. is different from the American Studies in China. The former focuses more on one aspect, which is “civilization”; and the latter includes almost every aspects of the U.S., among which the civilization is just a constituent (Ye 207). Take the curriculum in the American Studies program in Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) as an example. The American Studies program in BFSU is not only the oldest one but also the one in which all courses taught in English from the beginning of its founding. To help the students lay a comprehensive and interdisciplinary grounding in American Studies, the current ASC curriculum, made up of 28 courses, centers on three major areas: 1) American Government and Diplomacy, 2) American Society and Culture, 3) American Economy and Trade. In addition, there have been short courses and seminars offered by guest speakers from home and abroad to broaden the students’ horizon for better understanding of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Studies Center |url=http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/about/american-studies-center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129014049/http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/about/american-studies-center |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 November 2014 |website=Beijing Foreign Studies University |accessdate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every master student is required to choose one of the three major areas as his or her study track and chooses the courses accordingly.

The affiliation of each center decides its different research focuses, although sometimes they have some study overlapping. According to the affiliations, these centers can be generally divided into two groups. The one, affiliated to the international relations department, academically tends to focus on U.S. politics, economy, law and diplomacy. The diploma conferred is the Politics. While the other, to the foreign language department, usually concentrate more on racial/gender issues, literature, religion, education, history and culture. The diploma conferred is English Language and Literature. For example, the American Studies Center of BFSU belongs to the School of English and International Studies, and the Center of American Studies of Fudan University is administered by the Institute of International Studies.

The researches on different areas are not equally developed. The researches on economy, politics and foreign policy have been much more developed than that on American culture and thoughts. Out of the all articles from the year of 1987 to 2008 published in ''American Studies Quarterly'', the ones, which deal with the Sino-U.S. relations including American foreign diplomacy, foreign commerce and military policies and strategies, accounts for 50.9%. Whereas, the articles, which have its topics on literature, history, gender, intellectual history, philosophy and culture, only take up about 20% (Ye 207).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=叶Ye|first1=英Ying|title=中美两国的美国研究及美国学在中国的学科建 (American Studies in the United States and China and the Curriculum Setup of American Civilization in China)|journal=西南民族大学学报（Journal of Southwest Universities for Nationalities)|volume=5|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the accelerating academic exchange between two countries, more and more students are coming to the U.S. to study American Studies and at the same time American Studies scholars coming to China to do researches and teaching.

In [[Republic of Korea]], [[Sogang University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://english.sogang.ac.kr&lt;/ref&gt; (Seoul, Korea) is the sole institution that offers regular degree program both in bachelor(BA) and master(MA) degree in American Studies, named American Culture. The American Culture division is run by the Department of English along with English Literature and Linguistics. The undergraduate program consists of classes covering topics such as Native American, Black American, Asian American, American history and the context of specific period of America.

The Amman Message was delivered in [[Amman]], Jordan, as a [[Ramadan]] sermon by Chief Justice Sheikh Iz-al-Din al-Tamimi in the presence of King Abdullah II and a number of Muslim scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Embassy of Jordan - Washington, DC |url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr11092004.shtml |title=Jordan issues the 'Amman Message' on Islam |accessdate=2007-08-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070816204118/http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr11092004.shtml| archivedate= 16 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued by the [[International Crisis Group]], "The sermon stressed the need to re-emphasise Islam's core values of compassion, mutual respect, tolerance, acceptance and freedom of religion."&lt;ref name="J47"/&gt; The next year, in July 2005, an Islamic convention brought together 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries who issued a three-point declaration (later known as 'Three Points of the Amman Message').&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt; This declaration focused on:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message summary] - Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining why the message was issued, King Abdullah stated: "[W]e felt that the Islamic message of tolerance was being subjected to a fierce and unjust attack from some in the West who do not understand Islam's essence, and others who claim to be associated with Islam and hide behind Islam to commit irresponsible deeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885839539&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=King Abdullah calls to end extremism |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Tony Blair]], while [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], gave a speech in which he praised the Amman message and the gathering of numerous scholars, commenting, "This was a clear message that Islam is not a monolithic faith, but one made up of a rich pattern of diversity, albeit all flowing from the same fount."&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

Despite the ecumenical nature of the Amman Message, since it was issued there has been a marked decline in [[Shia-Sunni relations]] as a result of increased sectarian conflict in such countries as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Volpi|editor1-first=Frederic|title=Political Civility in the Middle East|date=11 Jun 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317977810|page=150}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The Amman Message has been criticized by CIFIA, a Barelvi group based in [[Hyderabad]] regards the message as contrary to the teachings of Islam.&lt;ref name="cifia"&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.cifiaonline.com/theammanmessage.htm|title=THE AMMAN MESSAGE|publisher=CIFIA|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suhail Nakhouda, writing in the Amman-based ''[[Islamica Magazine|Islamica]]'', stated that the Amman message did little to effectively address ongoing problems: "There is no water, no pavements; the economy is bad, and many young people are out of work. Peoples' lives, as well as the images they see, stay the same." Nakhouda stated that King Abdullah's message was likely to be dampened by his lifestyle, which he claims is the subject of criticism.&lt;ref name="J47"/&gt;

The '''Andras Felkai Academic Award''' is a [[scholarship]] intended to support young [[Hungary|Hungarian]] economics students to obtain a university degree or further studies. The scholarship is available for both undergraduate studies and graduate studies in Hungary and abroad. Eligible expenses which may be covered include tuition fees, exams, textbooks, teaching aids and the related costs of travel and accommodation, etc.

The aim of the Andras Felkai Academic Award is to contribute to the Hungarian economy and the financial sector with highly trained professionals who, like Andras Felkai, are characterized by a positive attitude, competence and international-mindedness. In order to achieves its aims the Award supports the studies of talented students and young professionals selected by the committee.

'''Andras Felkai''' was a prominent and respected figure of the Hungarian financial sector. He was born in 1956 in [[Budapest]], began his studies in [[Germany]], and then lived with his family in [[India]] for many years. He obtained his diploma at [[Dresden University of Technology|Dresden University]] of Technology Traffic and Transportation Psychology, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration. From 1980 until 1988 he worked at CIB Bank and left the bank as the leader of the division of International Corporate Relations. In 1988 he was appointed the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, later the Chief Executive Officer of Inter-Europa Bank. In the middle of the 1990s he worked at the subsidiary (branch?) of the São Paulo Bank in Vienna, then from the end of the year he was President and Chief Executive Officer of European Commercial Bank. After 1998 when Citibank bought the financial institute he played executive roles in Citibank Hungary. In the subsequent years, he successfully led his own consulting company, and was a member of the board of directors of [[Synergon Information Systems]] plc. He died in an aircraft accident with other members of the Management Board in June 2001.

Citibank Hungary, together with the Foundation for Developing Financial Culture, co-founded the Andras Felkai Academic Award in 2002. The family of Andras Felkai, several institutions and individual donors have also contributed to the fund.

The Andras Felkai Academic Award Fund is a non-profit organization and its financial support enjoys tax incentives.

An '''apologue''' or '''apolog''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀπόλογος, a "statement" or "account") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly.  Unlike a [[fable]], the moral is more important than the narrative details.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apologue|volume=2|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[parable]], the apologue is a tool of [[rhetoric]]al [[argument]] used to convince or persuade.

Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of [[Jotham]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:7-15); "The Belly and its Members," by the patrician [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]] in the second book of [[Livy]]; and perhaps most famous of all, those of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Well-known modern examples of this literary form include [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories derived from African and [[Cherokee]] cultures and recorded and synthesized by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a [[fable]] in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as "a satire in action."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

An apologue differs from a [[parable]] in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be ''true'' in the sense that "when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: "when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it."  The [[parable]] reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander).  It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, [[Martin Luther]] thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} for the main text, but the origin of the examples is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2017/01/calamity.html|title=Calamity|website=www.shonmehta.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with [[allegory]], [[metaphor]] and [[imagination]]. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the [[slave]]s, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely [[Aesop]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. [[La Fontaine]] in France; [[John Gay|Gay]] and [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]] in England; [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert|Gellert]], [[Lessing]] and [[Friedrich von Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in Germany; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Tomas de Iriarte]] in Spain, and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] in Russia, were leading later writers of apologues.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, "Le Coq et la Perle" ("The Cock and the Pearl").&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

''"A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. “Ho! ho!” quoth he, “that’s for me,” and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? “You may be a treasure,” quoth Master Cock, “to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.”''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On the other hand, in the romances of [[Reynard the Fox]] we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, [[Corti]], is said to have developed an apologue of "The Talking Animals" reaching twenty-six [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Antoine Houdar de la Motte|La Motte]], writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters [[amour-propre]] by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but [[Rousseau]] contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A work by P. Soullé, ''La Fontaine et ses devanciers'' (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] wrote a propos his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' "There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be ''felt''.  Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy."{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Astrolinguistics''' is a field of [[linguistics]] connected with the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).

== Early Soviet experiments ==

Arguably the first attempt to construct a language for interplanetary communication was made by the anarchist philosopher Wolf Gordin (brother of [[Abba Gordin]]) in his books ''Grammar of the Language of the Mankind AO'' (1920) and ''Grammar of the Language AO'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumka.be/sites/default/files/files/files/volf_gordin_-_grammatika_yazyka_ao_-_1923.pdf Wolf Gordin. Grammar of the Language AO (1923) (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ''AO'' language was presented at the First international exhibition of interplanetary machines and mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of [[Tsiolkovsky]]) in Moscow, 1927 as a language for interplanetary travels&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Smith. Rockets and Revolution: A Cultural History of Early Spaceflight. University of Nebraska Press, 2014. P. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-"fetishizing", non-"sociomorphic", non-gender based and non-[[Class discrimination|classist]]. The design of the language was inspired by the [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futuristic poetry]], brothers Gordins' pan-anarchist philosophy and early Tsiolkovsky's remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with later Freudenthal's insights)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1995_num_17_2_2419 Kuznecov S. Linguistica cosmica: La naissance du paradigme cosmique // Une familière étrangeté: La linguistique russe et soviétique. Paris, 1995 (Histoire Épistémologie Langage. 17/11 (Tome XVII - fascicule 2)), p. 211-234.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Freudenthal's LINCOS==
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
An integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician [[Hans Freudenthal]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], in 1960 – around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book ''[[Lincos (artificial language)|LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse]]'' seems at first sight non-linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language.  The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (''Homo sapiens''), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: “LINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephimeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing”.

==Ollongren's LINCOS==
The concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph  ''Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic'', written by the astronomer and computer scientist [[Alexander Ollongren]], [[University of Leiden]], The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic – which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense). Kadri Tinn's (Astronomy for Humans) review of Ollongren's book recognised that aspect – she wrote:

{{Quote|Astrolinguistics is the study of interstellar languages and possibility of communication using an artificially created language that is self-contained and wouldn't include some of the aspects of natural languages. … new Lingua Cosmica is a language system based on applied logic, the understanding of which might be expected from a civilization that has developed technology advanced enough to receive radio emissions.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8006">{{short description|Neo-Nazi and occult symbol}}
[[File:BlackSun.svg|thumb|The "Black Sun" symbol from Wewelsburg castle]]
The '''black sun''' (German {{lang|de|Schwarze Sonne}}) is a symbol employed by the [[SS]] during the [[Nazi era]], and in a post-[[Third Reich]] context by [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and some [[occult]] subcultures, such as [[Satanism]]. The first known occurrence of the symbol is on a green and white mosaic on a floor in [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]] remodeled and expanded under [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig runes]], symbols employed as a logo by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''. All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the "black sun" (and therefore also its name) developed from the influence of a popular German novel first published in 1991.

==Wewelsburg mosaic==
[[File:Schwarze_Sonne_Obergruppenführersaal_(SS_Generals%27_Hall).jpg|thumb|The former SS Generals' Hall (German: ''Obergruppenführersaal'') on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle with the dark green sun wheel mosaic located on the floor in the center of the hall]]
In 1933, [[Heinrich Himmler]] acquired [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]]. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2003: 148-150).&lt;/ref&gt;

A product of Himmler's remodeling, the symbol widely known today as the "Black Sun" consists of twelve circular sig runes on the floor of the structure's north tower (the ''Obergruppenführersaal''). The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative [[Merovingian]] discs dating from the early medieval period (see ''[[Zierscheibe]]''). The objects received notable discourse during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

In 1991, writer [[Russell McCloud]] published the popular novel ''Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo'' (German 'The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') which scholar [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] describes as an "occult-Nazi thriller". In the novel, McCloud links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the occult concept of the black sun, which had been introduced in the 1950s by the [[Landig Group]] as a replacement for the [[swastika]] and as a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the [[Aryan]] race. After the publication of the novel, the Wewelsburg symbol became popularly known as the "Black Sun".&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

==Neo-Nazism, white nationalism, and the alt-right==
The symbol has historically remained prominent in neo-Nazi occult circles, wherein it occurs frequently in print publications and on associated websites.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt; However, the symbol also sees frequent use in many [[neo-Nazi]], [[alt-right]], and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] more generally, as seen, for example, on imagery used by [[Vanguard America]] during the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in August 2017.&lt;ref name="PORTER-2017"&gt;Porter (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Azov Battalion]], a [[National Guard of Ukraine]] regiment widely associated with neofascism, employs the symbol in an official capacity as an emblem element, along with the Wolfsangel.&lt;ref name="LUHN-2014"&gt;Luhn (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by the Church of Satan==
Along with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the [[Wolfsangel]], the [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig rune]], and the [[totenkopf]], the black sun is used by adherents of the [[Church of Satan]] and other [[Satanism|Satanists]]. According to scholar Chris Mathews:

{{quote|In defending their use, Satanists draw attention to their historical origins, as most have origins that precede their Nazi application, some stretching centuries back into the past. [Specifically], they adopt the primary iconography of the SS, the Nazi's own elite order. With these symbols, many of the pre-Nazism connections are questionable. Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is [[Nazi occultism]], for which Nazi Satanic groups and [[Esoteric Nazism|esoteric neo-Nazis]] adopt it.&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp;q=black+sun&amp;chrome_dont_add_custom_search_engines_srsly=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathews (2009: 153)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mathews notes that Satanists sometimes combine Nazi imagery, such as when the Church of Satan's online store sold Wolfsangel rings by presenting them before a Black Sun background. Mathews says, "Despite the systematic exploitation of ambiguity, any denial that Nazi symbols are being used ''as'' Nazi symbols is both disingenuous and unconvincing."&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"/&gt;

==Pop culture==
In 2018, the symbol appeared on merchandise for Colombian pop singer [[Shakira]]'s [[El Dorado World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/shakira-selling-nazi-like-trinket-for-el-dorado-tour/a-44301030 | title=Shakira selling Nazi-like trinket for El Dorado tour | date=19 June 2018 | publisher=Deutsche Welle | accessdate=5 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Live Nation Entertainment]], "The necklace Live Nation designed for Shakira’s ‘El Dorado World Tour’ was based on pre-Colombian imagery ... However, some fans have expressed concern that the design bears an unintentional resemblance to neo-Nazi imagery. We sincerely apologize for this inadvertent similarity and have permanently pulled the item from the tour collection".&lt;ref name="SHAKIRA"&gt;Park (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carbon monoxide''' ('''CO''') is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to [[hemoglobin|hemoglobic]] animals (both [[Hemoglobin#Analogues in non-vertebrate organisms|invertebrate]] and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 [[parts-per notation|ppm]], although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of [[ground-level ozone]].
 
Carbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of two [[covalent bond]]s as well as one [[Dipolar bond|dative]] covalent bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Molecular orbitals in Carbon Monoxide CO |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]] |url=http://www.chemtube3d.com/orbitalsCO.htm |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with other triply-bonded diatomic molecules having ten valence electrons, including the [[cyanide]] anion, the [[nitrosonium]] cation and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].

==History==
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician [[Galen]] (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, David G. (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XsnPIfP0oBcC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Carbon Monoxide Toxicity''], CRC Press, p. 5, {{ISBN|0-8493-2065-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, the French chemist [[:fr:Joseph-Marie-François de Lassone|de Lassone]] produced CO by heating [[zinc oxide]] with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was [[hydrogen]], as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] by the Scottish chemist [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruikshank]] in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, W. (1801) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Some observations on different hydrocarbonates and combinations of carbone with oxygen, etc. in reply to some of Dr. Priestley's late objections to the new system of chemistry,"] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'' [a.k.a. ''Nicholson's Journal''], 1st series, '''5''' : 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, W. (1801) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA201 "Some additional observations on hydrocarbonates, and the gaseous oxide of carbon,"] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'', 1st series, '''5''' :  201–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by [[Claude Bernard]] around 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&amp;pg=PA38|page=38|title=Molecules of death|author1=Waring, Rosemary H. |author2=Steventon, Glyn B. |author3=Mitchell, Steve C. |publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-86094-814-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep [[motor vehicle]]s running in parts of the world where [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or [[wood gas generator]]s were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by [[gasification]] was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as [[wood gas]]. Carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during [[the Holocaust]] at some [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|Nazi German extermination camps]], the most notable by [[gas van]]s in [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], and in the [[Action T4]] "[[euthanasia]]" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_04R6DoPxLoC&amp;pg=PT323|page=323|title=A history of modern Germany, 1800–2000|author=Kitchen, Martin |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of [[carbon]]-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), such as when operating a [[stove]] or an [[internal combustion engine]] in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Mike. [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide – Molecule of the Month], Winchester College, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal gas]], which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as [[blast furnace|iron smelting]], still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KQqLicqcTM8C&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|title=Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future|author1=Ayres, Robert U.  |author2=Ayres, Edward H. |publisher=Wharton School Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-13-701544-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large quantity of CO byproduct is formed during the oxidative processes for the production of chemicals.

Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reactions in the [[troposphere]] that generate about 5{{e|12}} kilograms per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.176.4032.290|title=Carbon Monoxide Balance in Nature|year=1972|last1=Weinstock|first1=B.|last2=Niki|first2=H.|journal=Science|volume=176|pages=290–2|pmid=5019781|issue=4032|bibcode = 1972Sci...176..290W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, other forms of combustion, and [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].

In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal [[neurotransmitter]] in 1993,&lt;ref name = verma&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7678352 | title = Carbon monoxide: A putative neural messenger | year = 1993 | last1 = Verma | first1 = A | last2 = Hirsch | first2 = D. | last3 = Glatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Ronnett | first4 = G. | last5 = Snyder | first5 = S. | journal = Science | volume = 259 | issue = 5093 | pages = 381–4 | pmid = 7678352|bibcode = 1993Sci...259..381V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Carbon Monoxide Gas Is Used by Brain Cells As a Neurotransmitter |first=Gina |last=Kolata |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/26/science/carbon-monoxide-gas-is-used-by-brain-cells-as-a-neurotransmitter.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 26, 1993 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate [[inflammation|inflammatory responses]] in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and promoters of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name="Li2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19486912|year=2009|last1=Li|first1=L|last2=Hsu|first2=A|last3=Moore|first3=PK|title=Actions and interactions of nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide in the cardiovascular system and in inflammation—a tale of three gases!|volume=123|issue=3|pages=386–400|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.05.005|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials of small amounts of carbon monoxide as a drug are ongoing.&lt;ref name="clinical-trial"/&gt; Too much carbon monoxide causes [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].

==Molecular properties==
Carbon monoxide has a [[molar mass]] of 28.0, which, according to the [[ideal gas law]], makes it slightly less dense than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8.

The [[bond length]] between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]].&lt;ref name=gilliam&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gilliam, O. R. |author2=Johnson, C. M. |author3=Gordy, W. |title=Microwave Spectroscopy in the Region from Two to Three Millimeters|year=1950|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=78|issue=2|pages=140–144|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.140|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..140G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a similar bond length (109.76&amp;nbsp;pm) and nearly the same [[molecular mass]]. Carbon–oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8&amp;nbsp;pm in [[formaldehyde]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling point (82&amp;nbsp;K) and melting point (68&amp;nbsp;K) are very similar to those of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (77&amp;nbsp;K and 63&amp;nbsp;K, respectively). The [[bond-dissociation energy]] of 1072&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is stronger than that of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (942&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]. wiredchemist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ground state|ground]] [[electronic state]] of carbon monoxide is a [[singlet state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highly Excited Triplet States of Carbon Monoxide| first=C. R. |last=Vidal|date=28 June 1997 |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828201131/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html|archivedate=2006-08-28|accessdate= August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there are no unpaired electrons.

===Bonding and dipole moment===
The carbon monoxide has a very high [[bond-dissociation energy]], the strongest of any neutral molecule, 11.65 eV.  Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 [[electrons]] in the [[valence shell]]. Following the [[octet rule]] for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a C←O [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.122&amp;nbsp;[[Debye|D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scuseria | first1=Gustavo E. | last2=Miller | first2=Michael D. | last3=Jensen | first3=Frank | last4=Geertsen | first4=Jan |title=The dipole moment of carbon monoxide|journal=J.

The molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen has more electron density than carbon, and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. By contrast, the [[isoelectronic]] dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.

If carbon monoxide acts as a [[Metal carbonyl|ligand]], the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the [[coordination complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupinetti | first1 = Anthony J. | last2 = Fau | first2 = Stefan | last3 = Frenking | first3 = Gernot | last4 = Strauss | first4 = Steven H. | title = Theoretical Analysis of the Bonding between CO and Positively Charged Atoms| journal = J.

See also the section ''[[#Coordination_chemistry|"Coordination chemistry"]]'' below.

===Bond polarity and oxidation state===
Theoretical and experimental studies show that, despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the dipole moment points from the more-negative carbon end to the more-positive oxygen end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Alkorta | first2 = Ibon | last3 = Solimannejad | first3 = Mohammad | last4 = Elguero | first4 = Jose | title = Theoretical Study of the 1:1 Complexes between Carbon Monoxide and Hypohalous Acids | journal = J.

The calculated polarization toward the oxygen atom is 71% for the [[sigma bond|σ-bond]] and 77% for both [[pi bond|π-bonds]].&lt;ref name=Stefan&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stefan | first1 = Thorsten | last2 = Janoschek | first2 = Rudolf | title = How relevant are S=O and P=O Double Bonds for the Description of the Acid Molecules H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively? | journal= Journal of Molecular Modeling | volume =6 | issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=282–288 |doi=10.1007/PL00010730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oxidation state]] of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.

===Toxicity===
&lt;!--Please keep this section short, there is no need to elaborate here. Details will be more useful in the [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] article.--&gt;

It combines with [[hemoglobin]] to produce [[carboxyhemoglobin]], which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues.

The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and a feeling of weakness. Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. Infants may be irritable and feed poorly. Neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting), and seizures.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal" /&gt;

Some descriptions of carbon monoxide poisoning include [[retina]]l hemorrhages, and an abnormal cherry-red blood hue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ganong|first=William F|title= Review of medical physiology|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLa8vDBXDD4C&amp;dq=Ganong+WF.+Review+of+Medical+Physiology.+Norwalk+Ct:+Appleton+%26+Lange,+1995&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=May 2009|edition=22|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-144040-0|page=684|chapter=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most clinical diagnoses these signs are seldom noticed.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Ivan|date=1 June 2001|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=J R Soc Med|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270–272|pmid=11387414|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty with the usefulness of this cherry-red effect is that it corrects, or masks, what would otherwise be an unhealthy appearance, since the chief effect of removing deoxygenated hemoglobin is to make an asphyxiated person appear more normal, or a dead person appear more lifelike, similar to the effect of red colorants in embalming fluid. The "false" or unphysiologic red-coloring effect in anoxic CO-poisoned tissue is related to the meat-coloring commercial use of carbon monoxide, discussed below.

Carbon monoxide also binds to other molecules such as [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]].

===Normal human physiology===
{{see also|Gaseous signaling molecules}}
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a [[signaling molecule]]. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a [[neurotransmitter]] or a [[vasodilation|blood vessel relaxant]].&lt;ref name="endogenous_co"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=L|title=Carbon Monoxide: Endogenous Production, Physiological Functions, and Pharmacological Applications|journal=Pharmacol Rev|volume=57|issue=4|pages=585–630|date=December 2005|pmid=16382109|doi=10.1124/pr.57.4.3|last2=Wang|first2=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation.&lt;ref name="endogenous_co" /&gt; Relative to inflammation, carbon monoxide has been shown to inhibit the movement of [[leukocyte]]s to inflamed tissues, stimulate leukocyte [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s by leukocytes. In animal model studies, furthermore, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial [[sepsis]], pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing. These actions are similar to those of [[Specialized pro-resolving mediators]] which act to dampen, reverse, and repair the tissue damage due to diverse inflammation responses. Indeed, carbon monoxide can act additively with one of these mediators ([[Resolvin]] D1) to limit inflammatory responses. The studies implicate carbon monoxide as a physiological contributor to limiting inflammation and suggest that its delivery by inhalation or carbon monoxide-forming drugs may be therapeutically useful for controlling pathological inflammatory responses.&lt;ref name="pmid26095908"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallace JL, Ianaro A, Flannigan KL, Cirino G | title = Gaseous mediators in resolution of inflammation | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26095908 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.05.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26208702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uehara EU, Shida Bde S, de Brito CA | title = Role of nitric oxide in immune responses against viruses: beyond microbicidal activity | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 845–52 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26208702 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-015-0857-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26498251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakahira K, Choi AM | title = Carbon monoxide in the treatment of sepsis | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

===Atmospheric presence===

[[File:Carbon Monoxide concentrations in spring..jpg|thumb|Carbon Monoxide concentrations in Northern Hemisphere spring as measured with the MOPITT instrument.]]

Carbon monoxide (CO) is present in small amounts (about 80 ppb) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. About half of the carbon monoxide in Earth's atmosphere is from the burning of [[fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and biomass (such as [[forest fires|forest]] and [[bushfire]]s).&lt;ref name=Seinfeld2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seinfeld |first1=John |last2=Pandis |first2=Spyros |date=2006 |title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change |url= |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= |isbn=978-0-471-72018-8 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rest of carbon monoxide comes from chemical reactions with [[organic compound]]s emitted by human activities and plants. Small amounts are also emitted from the ocean, and from geological activity because carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high [[pressure]]s in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcllhZcy53cC&amp;pg=PA243|page=243|title=Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors|author1=Sigel, Astrid  |author2=Sigel, Roland K. O. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84755-915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect effect on [[radiative forcing]] by elevating concentrations of direct [[greenhouse gas]]es, including [[methane]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[ozone]]. CO can react chemically with other atmospheric constituents (primarily the [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], OH&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) that would otherwise destroy methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gnaNHeU4rgQC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106|title=Global climate change linkages: acid rain, air quality, and stratospheric ozone|author=White, James Carrick|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=978-0-444-01515-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] and ozone.

In the [[atmosphere of Venus]] carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 [[nanometre|nm]].

Due to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5194/acp-10-10655-2010 | title = IASI carbon monoxide validation over the Arctic during POLARCAT spring and summer campaigns | year = 2010 | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = Law | first2 = K.

===Urban pollution===
Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).

Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = McLinden | first2 = C.

====Role in ground-level ozone formation====
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone}}
Carbon monoxide is, along with [[aldehyde]]s, part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form [[photochemical smog]]. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH) to produce a radical intermediate &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[peroxy]] radical (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002JD002415|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observationsduring ACSOE|year=2002|author1=Reeves, Claire E. |author2=Penkett, Stuart A. |author3=Bauguitte, Stephane |author4=Law, Kathy S. |author5=Evans, Mathew J. |author6=Bandy, Brian J. |author7=Monks, Paul S. |author8=Edwards, Gavin D. |author9=Phillips, Gavin |author10=Barjat, Hannah |author11=Kent, Joss |author12=Dewey, Ken |author13=Schmitgen, Sandra |author14=Kley, Dieter |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=107|pages=4707|issue=D23|bibcode = 2002JGRD..107.4707R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO) to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydroxyl radical. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives O(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P) via photolysis, thereby forming O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; following reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:
:CO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
(where hν refers to the [[photon]] of light absorbed by the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule in the sequence)

Although the creation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical step leading to low level [[ozone]] formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QkErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|title=Ozone and other photochemical oxidants|publisher=National Academies|year=1977|isbn=978-0-309-02531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor pollution===
In closed environments, the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products.&lt;ref name="cpsc"&gt;[[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html Carbon Monoxide Questions and Answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109204227/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/466.html |date=2010-01-09 }}, accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[Florida Department of Health]], "every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning"&lt;ref name=EPHT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |title=Tracking Carbon Monoxide |publisher=Environmental Public Health Tracking – Florida Dept. of Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927164735/http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and [[gas heater|gas]] and [[kerosene heater|kerosene]] room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204014524/http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/NPDSPoisonData/AnnualReports/tabid/125/Default.aspx "AAPCC Annual Data Reports 2007"].

===Presence in blood===
Carbon monoxide is absorbed through breathing and enters the blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. It is also produced in [[heme#Degradation|heme catabolism]] and enters the blood from the tissues, and thus is present in all normal tissues, even if not inhaled.

Normal circulating levels in the blood are 0% to 3%,{{clarify|reason=what is this the percentage of?

=== Space ===
Outside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common molecule in the [[interstellar medium]], after [[molecular hydrogen]].  Because of its asymmetry, this [[polar molecule]] produces far brighter [[spectral line]]s than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect.  Interstellar CO was first detected with [[radio telescope]]s in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [[space telescopes]]. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the [[molecular cloud]]s in which most [[star formation|stars form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | year=1991 | volume=29 | pages=195–237 | author=Combes, Françoise | title=Distribution of CO in the Milky Way | doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.29.090191.001211 | bibcode=1991ARA&amp;A..29..195C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beta Pictoris]], the second brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], shows an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared emission]] compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide)&lt;ref name="LAT-20140308"&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |title=Did two planets around nearby star collide?

Solid carbon monoxide is a component of [[comet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1998A&amp;A...330..375G |title=Making a comet nucleus |author1=Greenberg |first1=J.

However, there is very little CO in the atmosphere of [[Pluto]], which seems to have been formed from comets. This may be because there is (or was) liquid water inside Pluto. Carbon monoxide can react with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|CO|2}}

This is called the [[water-gas shift reaction]] when occurring in the gas phase, but it can also take place (very slowly) in aqueous solution.
If the hydrogen partial pressure is high enough (for instance in an underground sea), [[formic acid]] will be formed:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HCOOH

These reactions can take place in only a few million years even at temperatures such as found at Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christopher Glein and Hunter Waite |title=Primordial N2 provides a cosmo chemical  explanation  for the  existence of Sputnik Planitia, Pluto |journal=Icarus |volume=313 |pages=79–92 |date=May 11, 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2018.05.007 |arxiv=1805.09285|bibcode=2018Icar..313...79G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Miners refer to carbon monoxide as "white damp" or the "silent killer". It can be found in confined areas of poor ventilation in both surface mines and underground mines. The most common sources of carbon monoxide in mining operations are the internal combustion engine and explosives however in coal mines carbon monoxide can also be found due to the low temperature oxidation of coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/illness_prevention/healthtopics/carbonmonoxide.htm|title=MSHA - Occupational Illness and Injury Prevention Program - Health Topics - Carbon Monoxide|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 200. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial production===
A major industrial source of CO is [[producer gas]], a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The initially produced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon to give CO is described as the [[Boudouard reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higman, C |author2=van der Burgt, M | title = Gasification | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-7506-7707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above 800&amp;nbsp;°C, CO is the predominant product:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → 2 CO (ΔH = 170 kJ/mol)

Another source is "[[water gas]]", a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of [[steam]] and carbon:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO (ΔH = +131 kJ/mol)

Other similar "[[syngas|synthesis gas]]es" can be obtained from [[natural gas]] and other fuels.

Carbon monoxide can also be produced by [[high-temperature electrolysis]] of carbon dioxide with [[solid oxide electrolyzer cell]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Yun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianchen|last3=Yu|first3=Bo|last4=Zhang|first4=Wenqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Jing|last6=Qiao|first6=Jinli|last7=Zhang|first7=Jiujun|title=A review of high temperature co-electrolysis of H                            O and CO to produce sustainable fuels using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs): advanced materials and technology|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|date=2017|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1427–1463|doi=10.1039/C6CS00403B|pmid=28165079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal [[oxide]] [[ore]]s with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:

:MO + C → M + CO

Carbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air.

:2 C(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO(g)

Since CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) [[entropy]] of reaction. The [[Ellingham diagram]] shows that CO formation is favored over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in high temperatures.

===Laboratory preparation===
Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formic acid]] or [[oxalic acid]], for example with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name="koch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brauer|first=Georg|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 1, 2nd Ed|date=1963|publisher=Academic Press|location=Newyork|isbn=978-0121266011|page=646|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLYatwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Preparative+Inorganic+Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered [[zinc]] metal and [[calcium carbonate]], which releases CO and leaves behind [[zinc oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]:

:Zn + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ZnO + CaO + CO

[[Silver nitrate]] and [[iodoform]] also afford carbon monoxide:

:CHI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO + 3AgI

Finally, metal [[oxalate]] salts release CO upon heating, leaving a [[carbonate]] as byproduct:

: {{chem|Na|2|C|2|O|4}} → {{chem|Na|2|C|O|3}} + {{chem|CO}}

==Coordination chemistry==

[[File:MO COeng.svg|thumb|left|200px|Energy level scheme of the σ and π orbitals of carbon monoxide]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-HOMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]] of CO is a σ [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-LUMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]] of CO is a π* [[antibonding]] [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]

Most metals form [[coordination complex]]es containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide [[ligands]]. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate [[back-donation]] from the metal d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital, to the π* [[molecular orbital]] from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; on the metal to form a [[sigma bond]]. This electron donation is also exhibited with the [[cis effect]], or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position. [[Nickel carbonyl]], for example, forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and [[nickel]] metal:
: Ni + 4 CO → Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1 bar, 55 °C)
For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide. Nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mond L, Langer K, Quincke F | title= Action of carbon monoxide on nickel| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1890| pages=749–753|doi = 10.1039/CT8905700749| volume= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the '''carbonyl''' [[ligand]]. One of the most important metal carbonyls is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:

[[Image:IronPentacarbonylStructure.png|150px|Structure of iron pentacarbonyl.]]
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-3D-balls.png|120px|Iron pentacarbonyl.]]

Many metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, [[iridium(III) chloride|iridium trichloride]] and [[triphenylphosphine]] react in boiling [[2-Methoxyethanol|2-methoxyethanol]] or [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] to afford [[Vaska's complex|IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;]].

Metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using [[infrared spectroscopy of metal carbonyls|infrared spectroscopy]].

==Organic and main group chemistry==
In the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with [[alkene]]s to form [[carboxylic acids]] in a process known as the Koch–Haaf reaction.&lt;ref name = koch&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Koch, H. |author2=Haaf, W.|title=1-Adamantanecarboxylic Acid|year=1973|collvol=5|collvolpages=20|prep=cv5p0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gattermann–Koch reaction]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|arenes]] are converted to [[benzaldehyde]] derivatives in the presence of [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]].&lt;ref name = coleman&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=''p''-Tolualdehyde|author=Coleman, G. H. |author2= Craig, David |last-author-amp=yes |collvol=2|collvolpages=583|year=1943|prep=cv2p0583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organolithium compounds (e.g. [[butyl lithium]]) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.

Although CO reacts with [[carbocation]]s and [[carbanion]]s, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;Chatani, N.; Murai, S. "Carbon Monoxide" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. [[halogenation|Chlorination]] of CO is the industrial route to the important compound [[phosgene]]. With [[borane]] CO forms the adduct [[Borane carbonyl|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BCO]], which is [[isoelectronic]] with the [[acylium|acetylium]] cation [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. CO reacts with [[sodium]] to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as [[acetylenediol|sodium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|Na|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}. It reacts with molten [[potassium]] to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, [[acetylenediol|potassium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|K|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}, [[benzenehexol|potassium benzenehexolate]] 6{{chem|K|+}} {{chem|C|6|O|6|6-}},&lt;ref name="wbuechIV"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Büchner | first1 = W. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = E. | title = Zur Kenntnis der sogenannten "Alkalicarbonyle" IV[1] Über die Reaktion von geschmolzenem Kalium mit Kohlenmonoxid | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume =47 |issue =6 |pages =1415–1423 | year = 1964 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19640470604}}

The compounds [[cyclohexanehexone]] or triquinoyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cyclopentanepentone]] or leuconic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.

At pressures of over 5 [[pascal (unit)|gigapascals]], carbon monoxide converts into a [[polycarbonyl|solid polymer of carbon and oxygen]].  This is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is a powerful explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150659a007|title=New phases and chemical reactions in solid carbon monoxide under pressure|year=1984|last1=Katz|first1=Allen I.|last2=Schiferl|first2=David|last3=Mills|first3=Robert L.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|pages=3176–3179|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/cm0524446|title=Pressure-Induced Polymerization of Carbon Monoxide: Disproportionation and Synthesis of an Energetic Lactonic Polymer|year=2006|last1=Evans|first1=W.

==Uses==

===Chemical industry===
Carbon monoxide is an [[industrial gas]] that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elschenbroich |first1=C. |last2=Salzer |first2=A. |title=Organometallics: A Concise Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-28165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the [[hydroformylation]] reaction of [[alkene]]s, carbon monoxide, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydroformylation is coupled to the [[Shell higher olefin process]] to give precursors to [[detergent]]s.

[[Phosgene]], useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and [[chlorine]] gas through a bed of porous [[activated carbon]], which serves as a [[catalyst]].  World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann's| author1 = Wolfgang Schneider | author2 =  Werner Diller | title = Phosgene | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Methanol]] is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows [[coal]] or biomass to be converted to diesel.

In the [[Monsanto process]], carbon monoxide and [[methanol]] react in the presence of a homogeneous [[rhodium]] [[catalyst]] and [[hydroiodic acid]] to give [[acetic acid]]. In the more recent [[Cativa process]], an [[iridium]] catalyst is used. These two processes for the carbonylation are responsible for most of the industrial production of [[acetic acid]].

An industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].

Carbon monoxide can also be used in the [[water-gas shift reaction]] to produce [[hydrogen]].

===Meat coloring===
Carbon monoxide is used in [[modified atmosphere]] packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with [[myoglobin]] to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment [[metmyoglobin]]. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat.&lt;ref name="Meatsci1999_SORHEIM"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sorheim, S |author2=Nissena, H |author3=Nesbakken, T |title=The storage life of beef and pork packaged in an atmosphere with low carbon monoxide and high carbon dioxide|journal=Journal of Meat Science|year=1999|pages=157–164|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0309-1740(98)00163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.

The technology was first given "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling. In 2004, the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor.&lt;ref name="Meatsci2005_eilert"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eilert EJ|title=New packaging technologies for the 21st century|journal=Journal of Meat Science |year=2005|pages=122–127|volume=71|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.003|pmid=22064057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this ruling, the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=644&amp;sub=sub1|author= Huffman, Randall D. |title=Low-Oxygen Packaging with CO: A Study in Food Politics That Warrants Peer Review|publisher=FoodSafetyMagazine.com|accessdate=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/food/foodsafety/questionable-technologoies/carbon-monoxide/|website=Food and Water Watch|title=Food Safety: Carbon Monoxide|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.3115:|title=Carbon Monoxide Treated Meat, Poultry, and Seafood Safe Handling, Labeling, and Consumer Protection Act (Introduced in House)|work=The Library of Congress|date=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive, but the bill died in subcommittee.

===Medicine===
{{see also|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name = verma/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name="Li2009" /&gt; However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref name="clinical-trial"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallurgy===

Carbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent, and whilst not known, it has been used in [[pyrometallurgy]] to reduce [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming [[carbon dioxide]] in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature. The [[blast furnace]] process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.

===Lasers===

Carbon monoxide has also been used as a [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in high-powered infrared [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ionin | first1 = A. | last2 = Kinyaevskiy | first2 = I. | last3 = Klimachev | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kotkov | first4 = A. | last5 = Kozlov | first5 = A. | title = Novel mode-locked carbon monoxide laser system achieves high accuracy | doi = 10.1117/2.1201112.004016 | journal = SPIE Newsroom | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===

Carbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars. [[Carbon monoxide/oxygen engine]]s have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the [[atmosphere of Mars]] by [[zirconia]] [[electrolysis]], without using any [[Water on Mars|Martian water resources]] to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel.&lt;ref name=landis2001&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Landis |title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=730–735 |doi=10.2514/2.3739 |bibcode = 2001JSpRo..38..730L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[blast furnace gas]] collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on [[Cowper stove]]s and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on [[open hearth furnace|open hearth steelmaking]].

'''Carlo Lodoli'''  (1690 – October 27, 1761) was an Italian [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], Franciscan priest, mathematician and teacher, whose work anticipated modernist notions of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[truth to materials]]. He claimed that architectural forms and proportions should be derived from the abilities of the material being used. He is sometimes referred to as the [[Socrates]] of architecture since his own writings have been lost his theories are only known from the works of others. Together with architects and architectural theorists including [[Claude Perrault]], Abbé [[Jean-Louis de Cordemoy]], Abbé [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]], Lodoli articulated a [[rational architecture]] which challenged the prevailing [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, Spiro (1985) ''A History of Architecture''. Oxford University Press, New York. p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girolamo Zanetti]] records that after 20 years of writing Lodoli finished his treatise on architecture but refused to publish it. Instead [[Francesco Algarotti]] endeavoured to publicise Lodoli's thinking in his own work ''Saggio sopra l'architettura'' (1757) albeit in a somewhat watered down form, emphasising imitation rather than Lodoli's daring anti-Baroque rationalism. It was [[Andrea Memmo]] who attempted to do justice to Lodoli's theories in his work ''Elementi d'architettura lodoliana'' (1786) published one year before the first edition of the only book bearing Lodoli's name, ''Apologhi immaginati'' (1787); a collection remarks and tales, often paradoxical in nature, told to his friends and pupils. Another pupil of Lodoli's, [[Francesco Milizia]] (1725–1798) published a long treatise, ''Principles of Civic Architecture'' (1781), which presented an exhaustive architectural system inspired by contemporary science.&lt;ref&gt;Lefaivre, Liane and Alexander Tzonis (2004) ''The emergence of modern architecture: a documentary history from 1000 to 1810'' Routledge, London and New York. p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodoli spent the years 1739 to 1751 in the office of Padre Generale Commissario di Terra Santa in Venice, here he committed himself to the restoration (1739–43) of the pilgrim's hospice attached to the monastery. This was his only built architectural work.

'''Chinese architecture''' demonstrates an [[architectural style]] that developed over millennia in [[China]], before spreading out to influence architecture all throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]]. Since the solidification of the style in the early [[Imperial China|imperial period]], the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the [[Tang Dynasty]], Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Northeast and [[Southeast Asia]]. Chinese architecture is typified by various features; such as, bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, the incorporation of ideas related to [[feng shui]] such as directional hierarchies, a horizontal emphasis, and the allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or other symbolism. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood, a relatively perishable material, and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials, much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications. Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China, such as the influences on [[mosque]] structures originating in the [[Middle East]]. Chinese architecture has also influenced neighboring areas, including Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. Although displaying certain unifying aspects, rather than being completely homogeneous, Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation, such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or used for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design. 

{{quote|The architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization. From every source of information—literary, graphic, exemplary—there is strong evidence testifying to the fact that the Chinese have always enjoyed an indigenous system of construction that has retained its principal characteristics from prehistoric times to the present day. Over the vast area from Chinese Turkistan to Japan, from Manchuria to the northern half of French Indochina, the same system of construction is prevalent; and this was the area of Chinese cultural influence. That this system of construction could perpetuate itself for more than four thousand years over such a vast territory and still remain a living architecture, retaining its principal characteristics in spite of repeated foreign invasions—military, intellectual, and spiritual—is a phenomenon comparable only to the continuity of the civilization of which it is an integral part.|[[Liang Sicheng]]|1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Liang Sicheng]], year 12, ''A pictorial history of Chinese architecture : a study of the development of its structural system and the evolution of its types'', ed. by Wilma Fairbank, Cambridge (Mass.): [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the 20th Century, Western-trained Chinese architects have attempted to combine traditional Chinese designs into [[modern architecture]] (usually government), with great success. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout contemporary [[China]] required higher speed of construction and higher [[floor area ratio]], which means that in the great cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings, which are normally less than 3 levels, has declined in favor of modern architecture. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including [[carpentry|major and minor carpentry]], [[masonry]], and [[stonemasonry]], are still applied to the construction of [[vernacular architecture]] in the vast rural area in China.

==History==
===Neolithic &amp; early Antiquity===
Chinese civilizational cultures developed in the plains along the numerous rivers that emptied into the [[Bohai Bay|Bohai]] and [[Honzhow Bay|Hongzhow]] bays. The mosr prominent of these rivers, the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and the [[Yangtze]], hosted a complex fabric of villages. The climate was warmer and more humid that today, allowing for millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. There was, however, no single "origin" of the Chinese civilization.

==Features==

[[File:Tang Tricolored Model of Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[sancai]] (tri-colored) ceramic mansion from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), excavated from a Tang era tomb at Zhongbu village in the western suburbs of Xi'an.&lt;br&gt;
The rectangular compound shown above has two sections of courtyards. The buildings on the axle line include central entrance, four-pointed pavilion, mountain-shaped front hall, artificial mountain and ponds, eight-pointed pavilion and mountain-shaped retiring quarters. The two sides of the central axle are arranged with corridor rooms symmetrically.]]

===Architectural bilateral symmetry===

A very important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[articulation (architecture)|articulation]] and bilateral symmetry, which signifies balance. Bilateral symmetry and the articulation of buildings are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. When possible, plans for renovation and extension of a house will often try to maintain this symmetry provided that there is enough capital to do so.&lt;ref name=KnappEA&gt;{{Citation| first = Ronald G. |last= Knapp |year=2006 |title=Chinese Houses: The Architectural Heritage of a Nation |publisher=Tuttle Publishing | isbn=978-0-8048-3537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary elements are positioned either side of main structures as two wings to maintain overall bilateral symmetry. The buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns in a structure to produce an odd number of bays (間). With the inclusion of a main door to a building in the center bay, symmetry is maintained.

In contrast to the buildings,  the Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. The principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ming Furniture in the Light of Chinese Architecture |first=Sarah |last=Handler |publisher=Ten Speed Press |date=January 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of "Nature and Man in One", as opposed to the home itself, which is a symbol of the human sphere co-existing with, but separate from nature. So, the arrangement is as flexible as possible to let people feel they are surrounded by and in harmony with nature. The two essential elements of the garden are hill stones and water. The hill stones mean the pursuit of immortality and water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to yang (static beauty) and the water belongs to yin (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete the whole nature. &lt;ref&gt; Cui, Huaizu, and Qingqing Hu (2015), ''Creation and Appreciation of “Nature and Man in One” and Chinese Classic Beauty of Garden – Taking the Suzhou classic garden as an example'', (https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/04/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001.html). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclosure===

In much of traditional Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes take up an entire property but enclose open spaces within themselves. These enclosed spaces come in two forms, the:&lt;ref name="KnappEA"/&gt;
*''Courtyard (院)'': The use of open courtyards is a common feature in many types of Chinese architectures. This is best exemplified in the [[Siheyuan]], which has consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas.
*''"Sky well" (天井)'': Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an "open space" surrounded by buildings, which is seen in northern courtyard complexes, can be seen in the southern building structure known as the "sky well". This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offer small opening to the sky through the roof space from the floor up.

These enclosures serve in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Northern courtyards are typically open and facing the south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping the cold northern winds out. Southern sky wells are relatively small and serves to collect rain water from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] [[impluvium]] while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories of the house and allows for exchange of cool air with the outside.

===Hierarchy===
[[File:Tomb of Northern Qi Dynasty in Jiuyuangang, Xinzhou, Mural, Building.jpg|thumb|A tomb mural of [[Xinzhou]], dated to the [[Northern Qi]] (550-577 AD) period, showing a hall with a [[Roof tiles|tiled roof]], [[dougong]] brackets, and doors with giant [[door knockers]] (perhaps made of bronze)]]
The projected hierarchy and importance and uses of buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front of the property are the least important.

South-facing buildings in the rear and more private location of the property with higher exposure to sunlight are held in higher esteem and reserved for elder members of the family or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help.&lt;ref name=zggjz&gt;{{citation |title=中国古建筑 |publisher=齊魯音像出版社出版发行 |last=浙江长城纪实文化传播公司 |year=2004 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/zhongguo-gu-jian-zhu/oclc/057661389 |isbn=978-7-88408-237-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used particularly for rooms of celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multiple courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically being used as storage or servants’ rooms or kitchens.&lt;ref name=KnappEA/&gt;

=== Horizontal emphasis ===
Classical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not well emphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Li |first = Yih-yuan |title = Ancestors |publisher = DE GRUYTER MOUTON |ISBN = 9783110805314 |doi = 10.1515/9783110805314.329 |chapter = Chinese Geomancy and Ancestor Worship: A Further Discussion |year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe in visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date = 2017-01-31 |work = Traditional Chinese Architecture |publisher = Princeton University Press |ISBN = 9781400885138 |doi = 10.1515/9781400885138-018 |chapter = Twelve. Typical Design Features of Ming Palaces and Altars in Beijing |title = Traditional Chinese Architecture }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preference contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. This often meant that [[Pagoda|pagodas]] towered above all other buildings in the skyline of a Chinese city.&lt;ref name="Kohrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kohrman |first = Matthew |date = March 1998 |title = Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China:Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China |journal = American Anthropologist |volume = 100 |issue = 1 |page = 236 |doi = 10.1525/aa.1998.100.1.236.1 |ISSN = 0002-7294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halls and palaces in the [[Forbidden City]] (which were in fact partially designed with some western influence),  have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearances suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of [[Jørn Utzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Richard |last = Weston |title = Utzon |publisher = Edition Blondal |year = 2002 |ISBN = 978-87-88978-98-8 |page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmological concepts ===
[[File:Siheyuan model.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Model of a Chinese [[Siheyuan]] in Beijing, which shows off the symmetry, enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized.]]

Chinese architecture from early times used concepts from [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]] such as ''[[feng shui]]'' ([[geomancy]]) and [[Taoism]] to organize construction and layout from common residences to imperial and religious structures.&lt;ref name="KnappEA" /&gt; This includes the use of:
* Screen walls to face the main entrance of the house, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines.
* Talismans and imagery of good fortune:
** [[Door god]]s displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage the flow of good fortune
** Three anthropomorphic figures representing [[Fu Lu Shou]] (福祿壽 fú-lù-shòu) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation "the three stars are present" (三星宅 sān-xīng-zhài)
** Animals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as [[bat]]s and [[pomegranates]], respectively. The association is often done through [[rebus]]es.
* Orienting the structure with its back to elevated landscape and ensuring that there is water in the front. Considerations are also made such that the generally windowless back of the structure faces the north, where the wind is coldest in the winter.
* Ponds, pools, wells, and other water sources are usually built into the structure.
* Aligning a building along a north/south axis, with the building facing south and the two sides facing east and west respectively.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions in traditional Chinese architecture reflected the belief in a type of [[immanence]], where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form. Although the Western tradition gradually developed a body of architectural literature, little was written on the subject in China, and the earliest text, the [[Kaogongji]], was never disputed. However, ideas about cosmic harmony and the order of the city were usually interpreted at their most basic level, so a reproduction of the "ideal" city never existed. [[Beijing]] as reconstructed throughout the 15th and 16th century remains one of the best examples of traditional Chinese [[town planning]].

==Architectural types==
There are various types of Chinese architecture. Some of these relate to the associated use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious.

=== Commoners ===
Due to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner's homes survive to this day compared to those of nobles. According to Matthew Korman, the average commoner's home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style, such as early 20th century homes, were very similar to late and mid imperial homes in layout and construction.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

These homes, be they those of bureaucrats, merchants or farmers, tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building would be a shrine for the deities and the ancestors, which would also be used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for the elders; the two wings of the building (known as "guardian dragons" by the Chinese) were for the junior members of the family, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room could be very close to the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Beijing Courtyard House |last=Cassault |first=Andre |publisher=Open House International |year=1987 |ISBN = |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or even two extra pairs of "wings" had to be built. This resulted in a U-shaped building, with a courtyard suitable for farm work.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt; Merchants and bureaucrats, however, preferred to close off the front with an imposing front gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law held that the number of stories, the length of the building and the colours used depended on the owner's class.

Some commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called [[Tulou]] for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou also shows the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials to build the walls with rammed earth. There is no window to the outside on the lower two floors for defense, but it’s open on the inside with a common courtyard and lets people get together easily.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Shao-Sen; Li, Su-Yu; and Shi-Jie Liao (2012). ''The Genes of Tulou: A Study on the Preservation and Sustainable Development of Tulou'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/12/3377/htm). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial===
There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the [[Emperor of China]]. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles, yellow having been the Imperial color; yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s ("''dougong''"), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surfaces of the walls, tend to be red in color. Black is also a famous color often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods are inspired by the black color to descend to the earth.

The Chinese 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the first Ming emperor for his personal use, was used as decoration on the beams, pillars, and on the doors on Imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings.

Only the buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine ''jian'' (間, space between two columns); only the gates used by the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] could have five arches, with the centre one, of course, being reserved for the Emperor himself. The ancient Chinese favored the color [[red]]. The buildings faced south because the north had a cold wind.

[[Beijing]] became the [[capital of China]] after the [[Mongol]] invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun since the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] dynasty. The [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The Emperor and the Empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Crown Prince]] at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (therefore the numerous imperial concubines were often referred to as "The Back Palace Three Thousand"). However, during the mid-[[Qing Dynasty]], the Emperor's residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] ordering facades, rather the Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access—there are no vistas, but a series of gates and pavilions.

[[Numerology]] heavily influenced Imperial Architecture, hence the use of nine in much of construction (nine being the greatest single digit number) and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms—just short of the mythical 10,000 rooms in heaven. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting Imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, where there is the notion of Ruler being affiliated with the Sun.

The tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th century [[Tang Dynasty]] tombs at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], can also be counted as part of the imperial tradition in architecture. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC).&lt;ref name="guo 2004 12"&gt;Guo, Qinghua.

Generally speaking, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], followed by a great hall, housing the statues of the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]]. Accommodations for the monks and the nuns are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th century [[Puning Temple (Hebei)|Puning Temple]] and [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]]. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have [[pagoda]]s, which may house the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha]]; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides.

[[Daoism|Daoist]] architecture, on the other hand, usually follows the commoners' style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of [[superstition]] about [[demon]]s which might try to enter the premise (see [[feng shui]].) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a [[Daoism|Daoist]] temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, the lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin and yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that creates eternity. &lt;ref&gt; Suhadolnik, Nataša Vampelj (2011).

The tallest pre-modern building in China was built for both religious and martial purposes. The [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of 1055 AD stands at a height of {{convert|84|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and although it served as the crowning pagoda of the Kaiyuan monastery in old Dingzhou, [[Hebei]], it was also used as a military [[watchtower]] for [[Song Dynasty]] soldiers to observe potential [[Liao Dynasty]] enemy movements.

The architecture of the [[List of mosques in China|mosques]] and ''[[Gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'' tomb shrines of [[Islam in China|China's Muslims]] often combines traditional Chinese styles with Middle Eastern influences.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Ancient Chinese urban planning}}
Chinese urban planning is based on [[fengshui]] geomancy and the [[well-field]] system of land division, both used since the Neolithic age. The basic [[well-field]] diagram is overlaid with the luoshu, a [[magic square]] divided into 9 sub-squares, and linked with Chinese numerology.&lt;ref&gt;Schinz, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In Southern Song Dynasty (1131AD), the design of Hongcun city in Anhui was based around "harmony between man and nature", facing south and surrounded by mountains and water. According to the theory of the traditional Chinese fengshui geomancy, it is a carefully planned ancient village and show the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept. &lt;ref&gt; Zheng, Shanwen; Han, Baolong; Wang, Dang; and Zhiyun Ouyang (2018). ''Ecological Wisdom and Inspiration Underlying the Planning and Construction of Ancient Human Settlements: Case Study of Hongcun UNESCO World Heritage Site in China'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1345). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;

Since wars happened in northern China very often, people moved to southern China. The building method of a courtyard house was adapted to southern China. The village of Tungyuan in Fujian Province is a good example of a planned settlement that shows the Chinese feng shui elements - psychological self-defense and building structure – in the form of material self-defense. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). ''Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen'', page 455 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf).

==Construction==

===Materials and history===
[[File:Earthenware architecture models, Eastern Han Dynasty, 3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Models of watchtowers and other buildings made during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (AD 25–220); while these models were made of ceramics, the real versions were made of easily perishable wood and have not survived.]]
Wood was originally utilised as a primary building material because it was very common. Also, Chinese people trust that life is connecting with nature and humans should interact with animated things, therefore wood was favored as opposed to stone, which was associated with the homes of the dead.&lt;ref&gt; Li, Lin; Tang, Lei; Zhu, Haihong; Zhang, Hang; Yang, Fan; and Wenmin Qin (2017). ''Semantic 3D Modeling Based on CityGML for Ancient Chinese-Style Architectural Roofs of Digital Heritage'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/5/132/htm). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike other building construction materials, old wooden structures often do not survive because they are more vulnerable to weathering and fires and are naturally subjected to rotting over time. Although now-nonexistent wooden residential towers, watchtowers, and pagodas predated it by centuries, the [[Songyue Pagoda]] built in 523 is the oldest extant [[Chinese pagoda|pagoda in China]]; its use of [[brick]] instead of wood had much to do with its endurance throughout the centuries. From the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common and replaced wooden edifices. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] completed in 605 or the [[Xumi Pagoda]] built in 636, yet stone and brick architecture is known to have been used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties.

The earliest walls and platforms in China were of [[rammed earth]] construction, and over time brick and stone became more frequently used. This can be seen in ancient sections of the [[Great Wall of China]], while the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a renovation of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).

*''Foundations'': Most buildings are typically erected on raised platforms (臺基) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on raised stone pedestals (柱础) which occasionally rest on [[Deep foundation|piles]]. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed [[earth]] platforms that are unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground directly. Upper class constructions typically have high raised stone paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; The vertical beams rest and remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the pressure exerted by the building structure.&lt;ref name=yu&gt;{{citation |first=Maohong |last=YU |first2=Yoshiya |last2=ODA |first3=Dongping |last3=FANG |first4=Junhai |last4=ZHAO |title=Advances in structural mechanics of Chinese ancient architectures |journal=Front.

*''Structural beams'': Use of large structural timbers for primary support of the roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.
*''Structural connections'': Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling alone, seldom with the use of glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion while under high compression.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Structural stability is further ensured through the use of heavy beams and roofs, which weighs the structure down.&lt;ref name=yu /&gt; The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as [[dougong]], and the used of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and groundshift from [[earthquake]]s without significant damage to its structure.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Dougong has a special function. The rich people applied valuable materials to decorate the Dougong for displaying their wealth. The common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). ''Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen'', page 458 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;
*''Walls'': The common use of curtain walls or door panels to delineate rooms or enclose a building, with the general de-emphasis of [[load-bearing wall]]s in most higher class construction. However, with the reduction in availability of trees in the later dynasties for building structures, the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction increased, with brick and stone being commonly used.
*''Roofs'': Flat roofs are uncommon while [[gable]]d roofs are almost omnipresent in traditional Chinese architecture. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof supporting beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Three main types of roofs are found:
*#''Straight inclined'': Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures.
*#''Multi-inclined'': Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces.
*#''Sweeping'': Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof. This type of roof construction is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the ridges of the roof are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines.
*''Roof apex'': The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (horse-head walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.
*''Roof top decorations'': Symbolism can be found from colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. They are usually used by the emperor. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which, in turn, represent youth and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628081026/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |archivedate=28 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] and the [[Six Dynasties]], miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called "soul vases" (''[[hunping]]''), found in many tombs of that period.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;{{citation

== Influence from outside of China ==
Despite largely being self-developing, there have been periods where Chinese architecture received significant influence from abroad, particularly during conquest dynasties such as the Yuan and Qing, who tended to be more outward-looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James-Chakraborty |first=Kathleen |date=2014-01-01 |pages=1–15|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |ISBN = 9780816673964 |doi = 10.5749/minnesota/9780816673964.003.0001 |chapter=Ming and Qing China |title = Architecture since 1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations and ruins of the Yuan capitol of [[Khanbaliq]] directly under the Forbidden City in Beijing were analysed by scholars to be both distinct from previous styles and ancestral to many later features of Ming and Qing architecture. Additionally the import of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan led to an influx of Islamic design elements, especially in mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hou |first=Renzhi |year=2014 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |ISBN =9783642553202 |doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-55321-9_7 |chapter = Khanbaliq (1267–1368) of the Yüan Dynasty (1260–1368) |title = An Historical Geography of Peiping |series = China Academic Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo city, Zhejiang province is a type of Islamic Architecture which appeared in China during the Song dynasty (990AD). When the Arabic traders arrived at the big commercial city of Ningbo and settled down there, they spread the Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, more mosques were built around Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Hagras, Hamada Muhammed (2017).

There are many miniature pagodas in Northeast China. They were built when the Buddhists came from India to spread Buddhism during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), and the empire supported the practice of Buddhism. They developed some new types of Buddhist architecture building with bricks. So, we can find many high-rise pagodas from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Youn-mi (2017).

== Influence in neighboring Asian countries ==
Chinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring Asian countries. After the Tang dynasty, the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], where the [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof]] design is ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tA_3y2XsMMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Barron's how to Prepare for the AP World History Examination|first=John|last=McCannon|date=19 March 2018|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="steinhardt 2004 228" /&gt;In [[Architecture of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from [[Architecture of India|Indian]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_History_of_the_British_Empire.html?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|first=Robin|last=Winks|date=21 October 1999|publisher=OUP Oxford|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tJM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=East+Asia#v=onepage&amp;q=East+Asia&amp;f=false|title=Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura|first=S.

The [[Chinese guardian lions|Chinese-origin guardian lion]] is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kgorman.ca/monster-monday-guardian-lions/|title=Monster Monday: Guardian Lions|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=kgorman.ca|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variation==
There is considerable regional variance in traditional Chinese architecture, some of which are very divergent from general layouts. Several of the more notable regional styles include:
===Shanxi architecture===
{{main|Shanxi architecture}} 
Shanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from [[Tang dynasty]], including the [[Foguang Temple]] and [[Nanchan Temple]]. [[Yungang Grottoes]] in [[Datong]] and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred [[Mount Wutai]] exemplify the religious architectures of China.
[[Shanxi Courtyard Houses|Shanxi family compounds]] are representative of [[vernacular architecture]] in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, [[yaodong]] is a type of [[earth shelter]] that are commonly found.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lingnan (Cantonese) architecture===
{{main|Cantonese architecture}} 
The classical Lingnan architecture is used primarily in the southern province of [[Guangdong]] and the eastern half of the neighboring [[Guangxi]]. It is noted for its use of carvings and sculptures for decorations, green brick, balconies, "Cold alleys", "Narrow doors", and many other characteristics adaptive to the [[subtropical]] region.
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Minnan (Hokkien) architecture===
{{main|Hokkien architecture}} 
Minnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the [[Hoklo people]], the Han Chinese group who have been the dominant demographic of most of [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]]. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and "cut porcelain carving" for decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Hongyin, X. (2009).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Hakka architecture===
{{main|Hakka architecture}}
[[Hakka people]] have been noted for building very distinctive walled villages in order to protect themselves from [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars|clan wars]].
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

===Gan architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Jiangxi}}
The [[Gan Chinese]]-speaking province of [[Jiangxi]] is noted for its distinct style, making use of bricks, wood, and stones as materials, primarily erected with wooden frames. 
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Yaodong ===
{{Main|Yaodong}}
The [[Jin Chinese]] cultural area of [[Shanxi]] and northern [[Shaanxi]] are noted for carving their homes into the sides of mountains. The soft rock of the [[Loess Plateau]] in this region makes for an excellent insulating material.&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Others===
Aside from the above, there are many other regional styles, such as [[Hutong]], which is prevalent in [[northern China]], [[Longtang]] and [[Shikumen]] of [[Haipai]] (Shanghainese) architecture, and so on.

'''Clinical psychology''' is an integration of science, theory and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[mental health|well-being]] and personal development.&lt;ref name="apa1"&gt;American Psychological Association, Division 12, [http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html About Clinical Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plante"&gt;[[Thomas G. Plante|Plante, Thomas]]. (2005). ''Contemporary Clinical Psychology.'' New York: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-47276-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to its practice are [[psychological testing|psychological assessment]], [[clinical formulation]], and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health professional|mental health profession]].

The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological [[clinic]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] by [[Lightner Witmer]]. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research),&lt;ref name="McFall2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McFall|first1=Richard M.|title=Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006|pages=21–49|issn=1548-5943|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095245}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology|Ph.D. science-practitioner model]] (integrating research and practice), and the [[Doctor of Psychology|Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model]] (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK and the Republic of Ireland the [[Doctor of Clinical Psychology|Clinical Psychology Doctorate]] falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—[[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]].

==History==
{{main|History of psychology|History of psychotherapy}} {{further|Eastern philosophy and clinical psychology|Islamic psychology}}
[[Image:Phrenology1.jpg|thumb|right|Many 18th c. treatments for psychological distress were based on pseudo-scientific ideas, such as [[Phrenology]].]]
The earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives.&lt;ref name="benjamin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin, Ludy|year=2007|title=A Brief History of Modern Psychology|location=Malden, MA|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|ISBN=978-1-4051-3206-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of such physicians included [[Patañjali]], [[Padmasambhava]],&lt;ref&gt;T. Clifford and Samuel Wiser (1984), ''Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;Afzal Iqbal and A. J. Arberry, ''The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi|Rumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, one approach to study mental conditions and behavior was using [[phrenology]], the study of personality by examining the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face ([[physiognomy]]) and [[Franz Anton Mesmer|Mesmer's]] treatment for mental conditions using magnets ([[mesmerism]]). [[Spiritualism]] and [[Phineas Quimby]]'s "mental healing" were also popular.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benjamin, Ludy|year=2005|title=A history of clinical psychology as a profession in America (and a glimpse at its future)|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume= 1|pages=1–30|pmid=17716080|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. The study of mental illness was already being done in the developing fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] within the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] movement.&lt;ref name="benjamin"/&gt; It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when [[Sigmund Freud]] was first developing his "[[psychoanalysis|talking cure]]" in [[Vienna]], that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began.

===Early clinical psychology===
[[File:Psychologicalcliniccover.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of ''The Psychological Clinic,'' the first journal of clinical psychology, published in 1907 by [[Lightner Witmer]]]]
[[Image:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] was the first to offer formal education in clinical psychology.]]
By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on "pure" science as the only respectable practice.&lt;ref name="benjamin"/&gt; This changed when [[Lightner Witmer]] (1867–1956), a past student of [[Wundt]] and head of the psychology department at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="heiden"&gt;Alessandri, M., Heiden, L., &amp; Dunbar-Welter, M. (1995). "History and Overview" in Heiden, Lynda &amp; Hersen, Michel (eds.), ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology''. New York: Plenum Press. {{ISBN|0-306-44877-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, ''The Psychological Clinic'', where he coined the term "clinical psychology", defined as "the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change".&lt;ref name="compass"&gt;Compas, Bruce &amp; Gotlib, Ian. (2002). ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education. {{ISBN|0-07-012491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was slow to follow Witmer's example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the U.S.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, Rand. (1999). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss12.html Clinical psychology born and raised in controversy.] ''APA Monitor'', 30(11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and [[neurology|neurologists]].&lt;ref name="routh"&gt;{{cite book|author=Routh, Donald|year=1994|title=Clinical psychology since 1917: Science, practice, and organization|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|ISBN=0-306-44452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at [[psychological assessment]]. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during [[World War I]] with the development of two intelligence tests, ''Army Alpha'' and ''Army Beta'' (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heiden"/&gt; Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.

===Early professional organizations===
The field began to organize under the name "clinical psychology" in 1917 with the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology. This only lasted until 1919, after which the [[American Psychological Association]] (founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized.&lt;ref name="apa100"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=American Psychological Association|year=1999|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss13.html|title= APA: Uniting psychologists for more than 100 years|magazine=APA Monitor Online|volume=30|issue=11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021204931/http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss13.html|archivedate=October 21, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, its division of clinical psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

===World War II and the integration of treatment===

When [[World War II]] broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled "shell shock" (eventually to be termed [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]) that were best treated as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="heiden"/&gt; Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition.&lt;ref name="reisman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reisman, John|year=1991|title=A History of Clinical Psychology|location=UK|publisher=Taylor Francis|ISBN=1-56032-188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; After the war, the [[Veterans Administration]] in the U.S. made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;

WWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 [[Scientist–practitioner model|scientist-practitioner model]], known today as the ''Boulder Model'', for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Routh, Donald|year=2000|title=Clinical Psychology Training: A History of Ideas and Practices Prior to 1946|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=2|pages=236–41|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.2.236|pmid=10717971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical psychology in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the [[National Health Service]]&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, John|author2=Llewelyn, Susan|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=What is Clinical Psychology?|edition=4th|location=UK|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-856689-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the [[British Psychological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry, David|year=1959|title=Clinical psychology abroad|journal=American Psychologist|volume=14|issue=9|pages=601–604|doi=10.1037/h0038711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree===
By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the [[University of Illinois]] starting in 1968.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Murray, Bridget|year=2000|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.html|title=The degree that almost wasn't: The PsyD comes of age|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008102440/http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.aspx|archivedate=October 8, 2010|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the [[Vail Conference]] on Professional Training in Psychology, the [[practitioner–scholar model]] of clinical psychology—or ''Vail Model''—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology ([[Psy.D.]]) degree was recognized.&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Norcross, J.|author2=Castle, P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|url=http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp|title=Appreciating the Psy.D: The Facts|magazine=[[Eye on Psi Chi]]|volume=7|issue=1|pages=22–26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060927062930/http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp|archivedate=2006-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name="murray"/&gt; Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"/&gt;

===A changing profession===
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Menninger, Roy|author2=Nemiah, John|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=American psychiatry after World War II: 1944-1994|location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Psychiatric Press|ISBN=0-88048-866-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is [[health psychology]], the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"/&gt; Other major changes include the impact of [[managed care]] on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.

==Professional practice==
Clinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on [[research]] into the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]], [[Psychotherapy|treatment]], or cause of [[mental illness]] and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a [[medical school]] or [[hospital]] setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an [[University|institution of higher education]]. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and [[forensic psychology|forensics]] (e.g., providing expert testimony in a [[legal proceeding]]).&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;

In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical psychologists who provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice.&lt;ref&gt;American Board of Professional Psychology, [http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm Specialty Certification in Professional Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214135515/http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm |date=2006-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States such specializations are credentialed by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] (ABPP).

==Training and certification to practice==

Clinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf Pathways to register as a psychologist including clinical psychologist in Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819231047/http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf |date=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in [[scientist-practitioner model|Ph.D.]] programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in [[Psy.D.]] programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"/&gt; Both models are accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;ref&gt;APA. (2005). [http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/qrg_doctoral.html Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology: Quick Reference Guide to Doctoral Programs].&lt;/ref&gt; and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a [[Masters degree]], which usually take two to three years post-Bachelors.

In the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych.), which is a practitioner [[doctorate]] with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year.&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, K. &amp; Pilgrim, D. (2004). ''A short introduction to clinical psychology.'' London; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-4768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]] and the Health Professions Council ([[health professions council|HPC]]). The [[health professions council|HPC]] is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist.

The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:&lt;ref name="ASPPB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asppb.org/|title=Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards|accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
#Completion of supervised clinical experience or internship
#Passing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination

All U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination.&lt;ref name="ASPPB"/&gt; Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), [[Licensed Professional Counselor]] (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychotherapyguild.com/disciplines.html|title=Professional Disciplines|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council [[health professions council|(HPC)]] is necessary. The [[health professions council|HPC]] is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the U.K. In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law "registered psychologist" and "practitioner psychologist"; in addition the specialist title "clinical psychologist" is also restricted by law.

==Assessment==
An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is [[psychological assessment]], and there are indications that as many as 91% of [[psychologist]]s engage in this core clinical practice.&lt;ref name="groth"&gt;Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment,'' 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-41979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming [[hypotheses]] about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than [[diagnoses]]) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;

===Measurement domains===
There exist hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high [[validity (psychometric)|validity]] (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] (i.e., consistency). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:
*'''Intelligence &amp; achievement tests''' – These tests are designed to measure certain specific kinds of cognitive functioning (often referred to as [[intelligence quotient|IQ]]) in comparison to a norming-group. These tests, such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC-IV]], attempt to measure such traits as general knowledge, verbal skill, memory, attention span, logical reasoning, and visual/spatial perception. Several tests have been shown to predict accurately certain kinds of performance, especially scholastic.&lt;ref name="groth"/&gt;
*'''Personality tests''' – [[Personality test|Tests of personality]] aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. They generally fall within two categories: [[objective test|objective]] and [[projective test|projective]]. Objective measures, such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]], are based on restricted answers—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—which allow for computation of scores that can be compared to a normative group. Projective tests, such as the [[Rorschach inkblot test]], allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli. 
*'''Neuropsychological tests''' – [[Neuropsychological tests]] consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular [[brain]] structure or pathway. They are typically used to assess impairment after an injury or illness known to affect [[neurocognitive]] functioning, or when used in research, to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups. 
*'''Clinical observation''' – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is a vital part of assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the [[mental status examination]], which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.&lt;ref name="groth"/&gt;

===Diagnostic impressions===
{{See also|Mental disorder}}

After assessment, clinical psychologists may provide a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] impression. Many countries use the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. Both are [[nosology|nosological]] systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including [[symptom]]s and signs.&lt;ref name="jablensky"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jablensky, Assen|year=2005|title=Categories, dimensions and prototypes: Critical issues for psychiatric classification|journal=Psychopathology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=201–5|pmid=16145275|doi=10.1159/000086092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several new models are being discussed, including a "dimensional model" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model]] of personality&lt;ref name="jablensky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="widiger"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Widiger, Thomas|author2=Trull, Timothy|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Plate tectonics in the classification of personality disorder: shifting to a dimensional model|journal=American Psychologist|volume=62|issue=2|pages=71–83|pmid=17324033|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.2.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a "psychosocial model", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mundt, Christoph|author2=Backenstrass, Matthias|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Psychotherapy and classification: Psychological, psychodynamic, and cognitive aspects|journal=Psychopathology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=219–22|pmid=16145279|doi=10.1159/000086096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use ''[[clinical formulation|formulation]]''—an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kinderman, P.|author2=Lobban, F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients|journal=Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy|volume=28|issue=3|pages=307–310|doi=10.1017/S1352465800003118|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27557001_Evolving_formulations_Sharing_complex_information_with_clients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical v. mechanical prediction ===
Clinical assessment can be characterized as a [[prediction]] problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior.&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"/&gt; For example, many [[psychotherapy|therapy]] decisions are made on the basis of what a [[clinical psychologist|clinician]] expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., [[psychological test]] results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, [[X-ray]], etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, [[diagnosis]], or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an [[algorithm]]ic, or "mechanical" fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., [[therapeutic effect|treatment response]]). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm.&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"/&gt; The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]]. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|decision-making]] processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.&lt;ref name="Meehl1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Meehl|title=Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Echo Point Books &amp; Media|isbn=978-0-9638784-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grove|first1=William M.|last2=Meehl|first2=Paul E.|title=Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal (mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: The clinical-statistical controversy.|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law| volume=2| issue=2|year=1996| pages=293–323| issn=1076-8971| doi=10.1037/1076-8971.2.2.293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What has come to be called the "clinical versus statistical prediction" debate was first described in detail in 1954 by [[Paul Meehl]],&lt;ref name="Meehl1954" /&gt; where he explored the claim that mechanical (formal, algorithmic) methods of data combination could outperform clinical (e.g., subjective, informal, "in the clinician's head") methods when such combinations are used to arrive at a prediction of behavior. Meehl concluded that mechanical modes of combination performed as well or better than clinical modes.&lt;ref name="Meehl1954"/&gt; Subsequent [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of studies that directly compare mechanical and clinical predictions have born out Meehl's 1954 conclusions.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Zald | first2 = D.H. | last3 = Hallberg | first3 = A.M. | last4 = Lebow | first4 = B. | last5 = Snitz | first5 = E. | last6 = Nelson | first6 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Clinical versus mechanical prediction: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 19–30 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.12.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=M.

==Intervention==
{{main|Psychotherapy}}
Psychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;

Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy ([[cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]]) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a [[psychoanalyst]] might encourage [[free association (psychology)|free association]], while a psychologist trained in [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;
*Insight – emphasis is on gaining greater understanding of the motivations underlying one's thoughts and feelings (e.g. psychodynamic therapy)
*Action – focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. [[brief therapy|solution focused therapy]], cognitive behavioral therapy)
*In-session – interventions center on the here-and-now interaction between client and therapist (e.g. humanistic therapy, Gestalt therapy)
*Out-session – a large portion of therapeutic work is intended to happen outside of session (e.g. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)
 
The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laroche"&gt;{{cite journal|author=La Roche, Martin|year=2005|title=The cultural context and the psychotherapeutic process: Toward a culturally sensitive psychotherapy |journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|volume=15|issue=2|pages=169–185|doi=10.1037/1053-0479.15.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four main schools===
Many clinical psychologists are [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrative]] or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model.

In the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The [[British Psychological Society]] Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy.

In the USA, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: [[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[behavioral]]/[[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]].&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;

====Psychodynamic====
{{main|Psychodynamic psychotherapy}}
The psychodynamic perspective developed out of the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various [[defense mechanisms|defenses]] used to keep them in check.&lt;ref name="gabbard"&gt;Gabbard, Glen. (2005). ''Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'', 4th Ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|1-58562-185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and an examination of the client's [[transference]] towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and "transfer" them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include [[self psychology]], [[ego psychology]], and [[object relations theory]]. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term ''psychodynamic psychology'', with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state.&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;

====Humanistic====
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}
Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the [[person-centered psychotherapy|person-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]] (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and [[existential psychology]] developed by [[Viktor Frankl]] and [[Rollo May]].&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt; Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McMillan, Michael|year=2004|title=The Person-Centred Approach to Therapeutic Change|location=London, Thousand Oaks|publisher=SAGE Publications|ISBN=0-7619-4868-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[intersubjective|intersubjectivity]] and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rowan, John|year=2001|title=Ordinary Ecstasy: The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology|location=London, UK|publisher=Brunner-Routledge|ISBN=0-415-23633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called ''self-actualization''. From 1980, [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as ''humanistic psychodrama''.&lt;ref&gt;Gessmann, Hans-Werner (2013;2), Humanistische Psychologie und Humanistisches Psychodrama. In: Humanistisches Psychodama Band 4, Verlag des PIB Duisburg, pp. 27–84.&lt;/ref&gt; According to humanistic thinking,&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneider, K.|author2=Bugental, J.|author3=Pierson, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=The handbook of humanistic psychology: leading edges in theory, research, and practice|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Sage Publications|ISBN=978-0-7619-2121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.

====Behavioral and cognitive behavioral====
{{main|Cognitive behavioral therapy|Behaviour therapy}}
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of [[cognitive therapy]] and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], both of which grew out of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[behaviorism]]. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through ''schemas'' or ''beliefs'') can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beck, A.|author2=Davis, D.|author3=Freeman, A.|year=2007|title=Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-476-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many techniques used, such as [[systematic desensitization]], [[socratic questioning]], and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including [[dialectical behavior therapy|dialectic behavior therapy]] and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|year=2006|quote=Albert Ellis is often referred as the "grandfather" of CBT for his influential work in this field.|url=http://www.aabt.org/What%20are/What%20Are%20Behavioral%20and%20Cognitive%20Therapies.html|title=What is CBT?|accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in [[behaviorism]]. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called [[applied behavior analysis|applied behavior analysts]] or behavioral health counselors. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]]. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donohue W, Ferguson KE |year=2006 |title= Evidence-based practice in psychology and behavior analysis |journal= Behav Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–50|format=PDF|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/3/335.pdf&amp;productCode=pa |doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including [[functional analysis (psychology)]], which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[functional analytic psychotherapy]], including [[dialectical behavior therapy|dialectic behavior therapy]] and [[behavioral activation]]. In addition, specific techniques such as [[contingency management]] and [[exposure therapy]] have come from this tradition.

====Systems or family therapy====
{{main|Family therapy}}
Systems or [[family therapy]] works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bitter, J.|author2=Corey, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|chapter=Family Systems Therapy|editor=Gerald Corey|title=Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy|location=Belmost, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the "system" as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors.

===Other therapeutic perspectives===
{{see also|List of psychotherapies}}
There exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.

*'''Existential''' – [[Existential therapy|Existential psychotherapy]] postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.&lt;ref&gt;Van Deurzen, Emmy. (2002). ''Existential Counseling &amp; Psychotherapy in Practice.'' London; Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-6223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gestalt''' - [[Gestalt therapy]] was primarily founded by [[Fritz Perls]] in the 1950s. This therapy is perhaps best known for using techniques designed to increase self-awareness, the best-known perhaps being the "empty chair technique." Such techniques are intended to explore resistance to "authentic contact", resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete "unfinished business".&lt;ref name="woldt"&gt;Woldt, Ansel and Toman, Sarah. (2005). ''Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice''. Thousand Oaks, CA.: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-2791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Postmodern''' – Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths.&lt;ref&gt;Slife, B., Barlow, S. and Williams, R. (2001). ''Critical issues in psychotherapy: translating new ideas into practice.'' London: SAGE. {{ISBN|0-7619-2080-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since "mental illness" and "mental health" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blatner Adam | year = 1997 | title = The Implications of Postmodernism for Psychotherapy | url = http://www.blatner.com/adam/level2/pmodpsy198.htm | journal = Individual Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 476–482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include [[narrative therapy]], [[solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]], and [[coherence therapy]].
*'''Transpersonal''' – The [[transpersonal psychology|transpersonal perspective]] places a stronger focus on the [[spirituality|spiritual]] facet of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boorstein, Seymour. (1996). ''Transpersonal Psychotherapy.'' Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-2835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] states of consciousness. It also is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential.
*'''Multiculturalism''' – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration.&lt;ref name="laroche"/&gt; Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of [[acculturation]] can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Mark|year=2005|title=Learning the Art of Helping|edition=3rd|chapter=Helping Someone Who is Different|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-111753-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Price, Michael|year=2008|title= Culture matters: Accounting for clients' backgrounds and values makes for better treatment|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume= 39|issue=7|pages=52–53|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/07-08/culture.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Feminism''' – [[Feminist therapy]] is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hill, Marcia|author2=Ballou, Mary|year=2005|title=The foundation and future of feminist therapy|location=New York|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=0-7890-0201-9|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Positive psychology''' – [[Positive psychology]] is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of [[Martin Seligman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Seligman, Martin|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|year=2000|title=Positive psychology: An introduction|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=1|pages=5–14|pmid=11392865|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.5|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; then president of the APA. The [[history of psychology]] shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing [[mental illness]] rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Snyder, C.|author2=Lopez, S.|year=2001|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location=New York, Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-513533-4|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linley, Alex|displayauthors=etal|year=2006|title=Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–16|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/positive.pdf|doi=10.1080/17439760500372796|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Seligman, M.|author2=Rashid, T.|author3=Parks, A.|year=2006|title=Positive Psychotherapy. |journal=American Psychologist|volume=61|issue=8|pages=774–788|lastauthoramp=y|pmid=17115810|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.61.8.774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
{{main|Integrative psychotherapy}}
In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as [[neuroscience]], [[behavioral genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[psychopharmacology]]. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norcross, John|author2=Goldfried, Marvin|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=The Future of Psychotherapy Integration: A Roundtable|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|volume=15|issue=4|pages=392–471|doi=10.1037/1053-0479.15.4.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional ethics==
{{globalize/US|date=February 2016}}
The field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the U.S., professional ethics are largely defined by the APA ''Code of Conduct'', which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.&lt;ref name="apa3"&gt;APA. (2003). ''[http://www.apa.org/ethics/code2002.html Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct].'' Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields.

The APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People's Rights and Dignity.&lt;ref name="apa3"/&gt; Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.

In the UK the [[British Psychological Society]] has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. This has four key areas: Respect, Competence, Responsibility and Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.bps.org.uk/sites/beta.bps.org.uk/files/Policy%20-%20Files/Code%20of%20Ethics%20and%20Conduct%20%282009%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other European professional organisations have similar codes of conduct and ethics.

==Comparison with other mental health professions==

===Psychiatry===
[[File:Prozac.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]], branded by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] as Prozac, is a [[antidepressant]] [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] prescribed by [[physician]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, and some [[nurse]]s.]]
Although clinical psychologists and [[psychiatrist]]s can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing the illness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Graybar, S.|author2= Leonard, L.|year=2005|title=In Defense of Listening|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=15895765}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although many also employ [[psychotherapy]] as well. Psychiatrists and [[medical psychology|medical psychologists]] (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[computed tomography|CAT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning.

Clinical psychologists generally do not [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a growing movement for psychologists to have [[prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescribing privileges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klusman, Lawrence|year=2001|title=Prescribing Psychologists and Patients' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=32|issue=5|pages=496–500|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.32.5.496|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, [[medical psychology|medical psychologists]] may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Louisiana, the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, and the United States Military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Halloway, Jennifer|year=2004|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/gaining.aspx|title=Gaining prescriptive knowledge|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume=35|issue=6|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling psychology===
[[Counseling psychology|Counseling psychologists]] undergo the same level of rigor in study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists helped people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; However, that distinction has faded over time, and of the counseling psychologists who do not go into academia (which does not involve treatment or diagnosis), the majority of counseling psychologists treat mental illness alongside clinical psychologists. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling.

Counseling psychology as a field values multiculturalism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div17.org/about-cp/what-is-counseling-psychology/|title=What is Counseling Psychology - Society of Counseling Psychology, Division 17|author=|date=|website=div17.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social advocacy, often stimulating research in multicultural issues. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. Counseling psychologists tend to be more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norcross, John |year=2000 |url=http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20030415061149/http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-04-15 |title=Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff? |journal=Eye on Psi Chi |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, counseling and clinical psychologists can be employed in a variety of settings, with a large degree of overlap (prisons, colleges, community mental health, non-profits, corporations, private practice, hospitals and Veterans Affairs). Distinctions between the two fields continue to fade.

===School psychology===
[[School psychology|School psychologists]] are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the U.K., they are known as "educational psychologists". Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the [[Educational Specialist|Educational Specialist Degree]] (Ed.S.), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.), and [[Doctor of Education]] (Ed.D.).

Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Silva, Arlene|year=2003|url=http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx|title=Who Are School Psychologists?|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|url=http://www.apa.org/crsppp/schpsych.html|title=Archival Description of School Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical social work===
[[Social work]]ers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the U.S. and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work. The Masters in Social Work in the U.S. is a two-year, sixty credit program that includes at least a one-year practicum (two years for clinicians).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cswe.org/NR/rdonlyres/111833A0-C4F5-475C-8FEB-EA740FF4D9F1/0/EPAS.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational therapy===
[[Occupational therapy]]—often abbreviated OT—is the "use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |year=2000 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/19/O0021900.html |title=Occupational Therapy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123505/http://www.bartleby.com/61/19/O0021900.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, [[cognitive]] and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities.

==Criticisms and controversies==
Clinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.&lt;ref name="observing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pilgram, D.|author2=Treacher, A. |lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Clinical Psychology Observed|publisher=Routledge|location=London &amp; USA/Canada|ISBN=0-415-04632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leichsenring, Falk|author2=Leibing, Eric|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=7|pages=1223–1233|pmid=12832233|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reisner, Andrew|year=2005|title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=55|issue=3|pages=377–400|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lilienfeld, Scott|displayauthors=etal|year=2014|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|ISBN=978-1462517510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with [[consumer/survivor movement|client groups]] and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client.&lt;ref name="observing"/&gt; It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kyuken, W.|title=Power and clinical psychology: a model for resolving power-related ethical dilemmas|journal=Ethics Behav.|year=1999|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–37|pmid=11657486|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[critical psychology]] movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a "psy complex", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smail, D. |url=http://www.davidsmail.freeuk.com/introfra.htm|title=Power, Responsibility and Freedom|type=Internet Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf|author=International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses|year=2001|title=''Response to Clinical Psychologists Prescribing Psychotropic Medications''|accessdate=2007-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614091424/http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2009 editorial in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggests that a large number of clinical psychology practitioners in the United States consider scientific evidence to be "less important than their personal – that is, subjective – clinical experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Psychology: a reality check|type=Editorial|journal=Nature |page=847|date=15 October 2009|doi=10.1038/461847a|volume=461}} Published online 14 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparatio''' in [[Classical rhetoric]] is strategy that uses ''comparison'' to persuade people. Comparatio relies upon people's [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about a phenomenon, and then discursively "links" that phenomenon to a different phenomenon about which the speaker/writer wishes to make a claim.

For example, if someone wanted to persuade an audience of the merit of putting in a new freeway system, they could use comparatio as a rhetorical strategy. They might compare the new freeway system to a "river of life flowing through our community" or they could call it a "path to commercial vibrance."

Comparisons can also be made to phenomena about which an audience could be expected to have negative feelings. For example, if you were opposed to the new freeway because of the environmental damage it would do to waterfowl nesting areas, you might compare the new freeway to "a corridor of death for our bird species."

The rhetorical success of comparatio hinges upon comparing your claim to a phenomenon that is:
*familiar to the audience
*likely to evoke emotional feelings
*adequately similar to your claim to seem logical.

It would not, for example, work well to call the freeway a "ham sandwich lodged in the throat of the community." The freeway seems more logically related to the throat (a passageway or throughway) than an obstacle in that passageway.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of parchment''' constitutes the care and treatment of [[parchment]] materials which have cultural and historical significance. Typically undertaken by professional [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|book and document conservators]], this process can include preventative measures which protect against future deterioration as well as specific treatments to alleviate changes already caused by agents of deterioration.  

==Parchment manufacturing and properties==
[[File:Perkament fabricage-516117.ogv|thumb|left|The making of parchment in the Netherlands]]
[[Parchment]] is the skin of an animal, usually sheep, calf or goat, which has been dehaired, processed with a lime solution and stretched under tension. The dried material is a thin membrane which is most commonly used as a writing surface, but can also be used to make other items like [[bookbinding]]s and [[drumhead]]s. Throughout Europe, parchment was the primary writing substrate from its development in the 2nd century BCE through the [[Middle Ages]], though it is used through the present day for various official documents. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whymark|first1=Francesca|title=Is not parchment made of sheepskins? Ay, my lord, and of calfskins too...|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/collectioncare/2013/09/parchment-conservation-lyte-geneaology.html|website=British Library Collection Care Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically parchment made from calfskin is called [[vellum]], though the term can also be used to refer to very fine quality parchment made from the skins of other animals. For the purposes of conservation and restoration, the term parchment is used in reference to vellum objects, as the terms have been used interchangeably throughout time to refer to objects with the same conservation concerns. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment Treatments|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/pcc/18_parchment.pdf|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parchment has unique structural qualities which differentiate it from paper-based materials. Typically, parchment is resistant to mechanical damage like tears or creasing, though it is easily susceptible to damage from mold and high temperatures.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; Parchment is also highly [[hygroscopic]] in nature, meaning that changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause irreversible variations to its structural makeup. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for your collections: Parchment documents|url=http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/276234/Caring-for-your-collections-Parchment-documents.pdf|website=State Library of Queensland|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific qualities dictate the conservation and restoration treatments required for parchment. 

===Physical and chemical properties===
Most skins used for parchment are between 1 – 3 mm in thickness before processing. Animal skin used for parchment all has the same basic structure, with slight variations due to the species, age and diet of the specific animal. Skin is composed of innumerable fibrils made up of the protein [[collagen]], which are held in bundles that interweave in a three dimensional manner through the skin.  The fibrous material is composed of many long chain molecules of collagen, which can react with certain environmental factors. One universal property of collagen is that it exhibits sudden shrinkage when heated in water, starting at 65&amp;#176;C. Prolonged exposure to alkali, like in parchment liming process, changes the amino acids, consequently dropping shrinkage temperatures as low as 55&amp;#176;C. 
&lt;ref name="Betty Haines"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haines|first1=Betty|title=Parchment|publisher=Leather Conservation Center|isbn=9780946072057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Manufacturing===
Once it is removed from the animal, the skin is temporarily preserved, either by drying or liberal application of salt, until it can be processed. The skin is then immersed in water for 48 hours, which cleans and rehydrates it. This step also removes the non-collagenous materials, like [[hyaluronic acid]], [[dermaten sulphate]] and [[plasma proteins]]. The skin is then soaked in a lime or [[alkali]] solution, known as the [[Liming (leather processing)|liming]] process.&lt;ref name="Betty Haines" /&gt; In the 19th century, chemicals were added to speed up the liming process, which resulted in weaker parchments. These added compounds sometimes reacted to produce gypsum, giving the parchment a characteristic gray hue.&lt;ref name="NEDCC" /&gt; The skin is then stretched in suspension on a frame, constricting it as it dries. This ensures even contraction across the entire parchment which ensures that it will remain flat when dried. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hingley|first1=Mark|title=Success in the Treatment of Parchment and Vellum using a Suction Table|journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists|date=2001|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00379810120037513}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being prepared, parchment is sometimes coated so that it is more receptive to pigment and ink. Historical coatings, which include chalk, egg whites and matte paint, must be taken into consideration as a meaningful part of the preservation and conservation plan.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; 

The manufacturing process, which removes the skin's natural fats and oils, means that parchment is more reactive to moisture and relative humidity than other skin-based material. After being stretched, parchment has an inherent desire to revert to its original animal shape, especially if left unrestrained or exposed to repeated changes in relative humidity.&lt;ref name="Sackville manuscript"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxtable|first1=Merryl|title=Tethering the cow – Treatment and display of the Sackville Pedigree – a large 16th century heraldic parchment manuscript|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Autumn 2002|issue=42|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-42/tethering-the-cowtreatment-and-display-of-the-sackville-pedigreea-large-16th-century-heraldic-parchment-manuscript/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
Parchment is usually positively identified by sight, sometimes with the assistance of a [[hand lens]] or [[microscope]]. Visible hair follicle pattern, veining, scars, bruises and sometimes fat deposits all help confirm the animal origin of the material. Additional light sources including [[ultraviolet]] lights, can make these properties more easily identifiable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment|url=https://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/librarypreservation/mee/preservation/parchment.html|website=Library Preservation and Conservation|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes visual examination is not sufficient to distinguish parchment from certain types of highly [[calender]]ed papers. Misidentification of these materials can lead to inappropriate preservation methods or conservation treatments.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; Analytical testing, which involves removing a small piece of parchment, can be done by or under the supervision of a professional conservator-restorer to ensure positive identification. One type of analytical testing involves examining the parchment specimen under a [[light microscope]] or [[scanning electron microscopy]]. A simple flame test can also be done on the parchment specimen; true parchment will emit the meaty smell of burned protein, while other look-alike materials will smell like paper or wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Jack|title=Identifying Parchment|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/2002/0610.html|website=Conservation OnLine DistList}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agents of deterioration==

*'''Relative humidity changes''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen, Lee &amp; Sobel|title=THE EFFECTS OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY ON SOME PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MODERN VELLUM:|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|date=1991|volume=33|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-03-005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause parchment to change shape, especially if movement is restrained by a frame or mount at certain parts of the object, which leads to uneven distortion. This distortion can result in cockling and destabilization of any pigments affixed to the parchment.&lt;ref name="Single leaf parchment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norman|first1=Daniel|title=The mounting of single leaf parchment &amp; vellum objects for display and storage|journal=Conservation Journal|date=October 1993|issue=09|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-09/the-mounting-of-single-leaf-parchment-and-vellum-objects-for-display-and-storage/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low humidity levels can cause parchment to [[Desiccation|desiccate]]. &lt;ref name="PSAP" /&gt;
*'''Water and excessive moisture'''
Direct water contact and excessive moisture in the environment can cause structural problems for parchment including: expansion of object; discoloration; alteration of surface coatings; gelatinization of skin; and realignment of fibers. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*'''Oxygen'''
Atmospheric oxygen reacts with the chemical composition of parchment, which subsequently changes the physical properties of the object over time. &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free" /&gt;
*'''Mold'''
Mold is a probable consequence of water damage to parchment, especially when the object is not dried within 48 hours of the initial contact with water. &lt;ref name="Drying methods - NARA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplan &amp; Ludwig|title=Efficacy of Various Drying Methods|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/conservation/drying-methods-01.html|website=Archives.gov|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Heat:'''
Heat in excess of the ideal storage conditions can cause damage to collagen structure, irreversible contraction and alteration of surface materials in parchment objects. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*'''Light exposure'''
Lower wavelength and [[ultraviolet]] light lead to degradation of the collagen structure and photodiscoloration, usually causing yellowing of parchment.&lt;ref name="Betty Haines" /&gt; Parchment exposed to UV light can also have a photochemical reaction causing it to become brittle.&lt;ref name="NEDCC"&gt;{{cite web|title=INHERENT VICe: Materials|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-4/2inherent-vice-materials#parchment|website=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Flaking and friability:'''
Consolidation of media on parchment, such as those found in [[Conservation and restoration of illuminated manuscripts#inks and pigments|illuminated manuscripts]], is compromised by the instability of the parchment substrate. Excessive flexing or chemical changes in the parchment can lead to loss of pigment and text. &lt;ref name="Quandt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quandt|first1=Abigail|title=Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual|date=1996|volume=15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Poor storage'''
Parchment which has been adhered to a rigid mount for storage or display is unable to expand and contract, as its natural tendency. This poor storage technique can lead to tears, perforations and loss. Parchment stored in an unregulated and inconsistent environment is more susceptible to damage. &lt;ref name="PSAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment|url=https://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/parchment|website=Preservation Self-Assessment Program|publisher=University of Illinois Libraries|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and Preventative Care==
Proper storage environments can help ward off structural, chemical and environmental changes which affects the long-term preservation of parchment. Storage factors must take into account the factors of the particular parchment object, including its condition, age, storage history and plans for use. [[Conservation and restoration of illuminated manuscripts|Illuminated manuscripts]] and composite parchment objects, which may include [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and ribbons, may have additional storage needs.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; A consistent storage environment is crucial for the long-term stability of parchment, which is especially vulnerable to changes in humidity, temperature and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Single leaf parchment" /&gt; 

Microenvironments are less expensive ways to provide consistent storage environments for parchment if the external storage conditions are not ideal. Moisture sensitive parchments can be stored in a [[Plexiglas]] sandwich by inserting the matted parchment between two sheets of acrylic and taping off all sides. Parchment can also be stored in envelopes constructed out of [[polyester]] sheets. &lt;ref name="Garside Microenvironments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside &amp; Walker|title=The Formation of Microenvironments in Polyester Enclosures|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|volume=13|issue=1|url=http://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021223/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the long-term preservation of organic material like parchment, the ideal temperature range is 10-15&amp;#176;C with a [[relative humidity]] level of 30-50%. The ideal storage and display environment is oxygen-free, as oxygen prevalence has been shown to react with collagen over time, leading to increased brittleness of parchment. Oxygen-free storage and display cases are filled with [[inert gas]] as well as a chemical substance that reacts as an absorber if any stray oxygen leaks into the encasement. &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maekawa|first1=Shin|title=Oxygen-Free Museum Cases|publisher=The Getty Institute|isbn=0-89236-529-3|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/oxygenfree.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns of conservation==
All conservation and restoration treatments of parchment objects should follow the conduct set forth in [[American Institute for Conservation]]'s Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VxrIGUdTLAo]. The hazards of specific treatments need to be weighed against the benefits, as many traditional liquid-based conservation techniques can pose risks to parchment.

==Conservation treatments==
===Removal of previous restorations===
Previous repairs and conservation treatments are removed if it is determined that the parchment is in good condition and that the repair is not of historic importance to the parchment. Dried out patches are removed via cleaning and humidification techniques. Parchment objects that have been attached to mounts are removed with a sharpened lifting tool and a small amount of moisture. Previous laminations, like [[Goldbeater's skin]] and Mipofolie, can sometimes be removed with solvents and mechanical techniques, though this removal technique can risk additional damage to the original parchment. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

===Cleaning===
Surface cleaning of parchment has been developed after methods used for cleaning paper, with a few key differences related to the structural and chemical properties of parchment.  For the most part, chemical treatments are ineffective and some, like hypochlorites and [[methyl bromide]], can [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturalize]] parchment. Prior to cleaning, any flaking or vulnerable media is [[Conservation_and_restoration_of_illuminated_manuscripts#Consolidation|consolidated]] to ensure it does not detach from the parchment substrate. Consolidation of parchment media is undertaken by applying various dilute adhesives like isinglass, gelatin or parchment size through brush application or by the use of an ultrasonic humidifcation apparatus.  

If their presence is determined upon examination, insects and pests are eliminated and the parchment disinfected. An appropriate round of [[fumigation]] in an [[autoclave]] is used to remove pests and sterilize the object. Dry and wet cleaning techniques can both be used effectively on parchment objects. Mechanical cleaning using erasers and other abrasive tools is used to remove mildew and dirt. Surface cleaning of parchment is typically completed using white vinyl erasers (solid and grated) and confined to areas where no media is present. Water baths, which sometimes use neutral detergents or alcohol as additives, can be used to clean as well as prepare the parchment for stretching as part of the conservation process. &lt;ref name="RAMP Study"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vinas|title=Traditional restoration techniques: a RAMP study|date=1988|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris|url=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/ramp/html/r8817e/r8817e09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wet cleaning method, which is especially useful for removing mold and mildew, uses a cotton swab covered in fluid, usually [[denatured alcohol]], ethanol or saliva. [[Laser]] cleaning may provide a non-contact cleaning process, though conservation labs throughout Europe still mostly use traditional wet and dry cleaning methods for parchment.&lt;ref name="Laser cleaning Vest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vest|first1=Marie|title=Critical evaluation of laser cleaning of parchment documents|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Spring 2002|volume=40|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-40/critical-evaluation-of-laser-cleaning-of-parchment-documents/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humidification===
Humidification is a parchment conservation treatment which involves the controlled and monitored increase in relative humidity. Humidified parchments are more flexible, which will allow for corrections to distortions like cockling, puckering and changes in original size. Some methods of humidification are: humidification chambers: moisture chambers with ultrasonic [[humidifier]], moisture chambers with steam/ultrasonic mist; and application of alcohol and water. Localized humidification is sometimes used to treat specific folds or creases in parchment objects. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

===Flattening, tensioning and drying=== 
After humidification, drying techniques are necessary to ensure that the parchment lays flat and does not suffer additional moisture-related issues. The specific method is dependent on the condition of the object, as well as the humidification process utilized. Some of the most common methods include:
*Drying and flattening under pressure, often pressed between two absorbent surfaces
*Tensioning at the edges, where the parchment is constricted at the edges with weights or clips. This techniques most closely reflects parchment's original manufacturing process.
*Stretch drying on [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Terylene]]
*Vacuum suction table flattening&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

Localized creases are eased with a solution of 80% to 90% [[isopropyl alcohol]] and water, which is applied to the creases directly with a cotton swab and then gently pulled flat by hand. The Alcohol-Water mixture is [[azeotropic]], meaning both components evaporate simultaneously. The solution has a lower surface tension than just water, which causes the fibers to suffer less shrinkage.&lt;ref name=woods1995&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00379819509511780|author=Woods, Chris|year=1995|title= Conservation Treatments for Parchment Documents|journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists|volume=16|issue =2|pages=221–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending and in-filling losses===
Sewing tears is not recommended as a conservation treatment, unless it is replacing a sewn portion original to the object. Correcting non-original splits, tears, perforations and losses in parchment requires careful consideration of its specific condition. For losses that don't require much support, transparent membranes, such as fish skin or sausage casing, are placed over the damaged area with an adhesive. Infill materials, including new parchment, reconstituted parchment and [[Washi|Japanese paper]], are used to repair losses requiring greater structural support. All infill materials have some conservation concerns, as they will react differently  to environmental factors than the original parchment. 
*New parchment: It is difficult to match the infill material to the original parchment type in terms of animal, thickness and appearance. Modern parchments that appear visually similar also respond differently to humidity fluctuations, causing potential problems after the conservation treatment. Parchment infills are matched by thinning them to the appropriate size and [[Bevel|bevelling]] the original parchment before the repair.
*Japanese paper: Paper is dissimilar to parchment in both appearance and behavior, which can pose the future issue of storing an object with composite materials. Paper infills can be toned with watercolor or [[acrylic paints]] to better match the original parchment appearance. Acrylic-toned papers are treated with various adhesives such as B-72, Aquazol, or PVA to mimic the translucency of the surrounding parchment. Varying layers of application are used to best approximate the thickness and condition of the specific original parchment.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*Reconstituted parchment: Collagen fibers and dry [[cellulose]] materials are mixed together with liquid ingredients to create a [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]]-like substance. This material is applied to the original parchment in a process similar to [[leafcasting]] paper.&lt;ref name="Reconstituted parchment fill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wikarski, Eyb-Green &amp; Baatz|title=Filling in Losses in Parchment Bound Volumes – Part I: Assessment of Parchment and Paper Fibres in Reconstituted Parchment|journal=Restaurator|date=2015|volume=36|issue=1|pages=25-46|url=http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002frest.2015.36.issue-1$002fres-2014-0103$002fres-2014-0103.pdf?format=INT&amp;t:ac=j$002frest.2015.36.issue-1$002fres-2014-0103$002fres-2014-0103.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster Recovery===
Parchment which has been accidentally exposed to excess moisture or water is extremely susceptible to mold, mechanical damage and irreversible dimensional changes. Emergencies often affect large quantities of objects, therefore the mass treatment of objects usually includes freezing or [[freeze-drying]] as the first step. As time permits, parchment object are then thawed and dried using more traditional measures. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

==Case Studies==

===Charters of Freedom===
The United States [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], collectively known as the Charters of Freedom, were housed in metal and glass encasements, filled with [[helium]] gas, from 1952 to 2001. In 1951, the [[National Bureau of Standards]] reported that an inert gas environment would be the best means of preserving the Charters of Freedom.  &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free" /&gt; In 1982, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] partnered with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on a 9-year project which determined that the encasement glass was deteriorating. Upon the issuing of this report, it was decided that new encasements and conservation treatments were needed for the long-term preservation of the Charters of Freedom. The documents were thoroughly examined for signs of deterioration and past restorations, all of which were thoroughly documented in condition reports. 

The first step of treatment stabilized the ink of the text using a gelatin adhesive. The dirt and grime were then cleaned from the parchments, though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten the parchments. The Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All the parchments were then installed into new titanium and aluminum encasements, developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], which are filled with inert [[argon]] gas. The current environmental conditions of the Charters of Freedom encasements is monitored by scientists and conservators for signs of possible deterioration agents. &lt;ref name="NARA Charters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ritzenthaler &amp; Nicholson|title=A New Era Begins for the Charters of Freedom|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_preservation_02.html|website=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canterbury Magna Carta===
In 1731, one of four surviving copies of the 1215 [[Magna Carta]], known as the Canterbury Magna Carta, was partially damaged in a fire at its temporary storage location at [[Ashburnham House]]. Damage included shrinkage and discoloration of the parchment substrate, though the ink text was still legible. In the 1830s, [[British Museum]] staff attempted a restoration, using chemicals to treat the parchment and unintentionally rendering the text illegible. 

In 2014, the [[British Library]] undertook a [[Multispectral image|multispectral imaging]] project to determine if the text on the damaged document could be recovered. Analysis under [[ultraviolet]] light allowed scientists and conservators to see text that was invisible to the naked eye. This new technology allows the document to be used for continued research purposes, despite the previous botched restoration.&lt;ref name="Magna Carta conservation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Christina|title=Revealing the secrets of the burnt Magna Carta|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/revealing-the-secrets-of-the-burnt-magna-carta|website=British Library|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16606">'''Cultural group selection''' is an explanatory model within [[cultural evolution]] of how cultural traits evolve according to the competitive advantage they bestow upon a group. This multidisciplinary approach to the question of human culture engages research from the fields of [[anthropology]], [[behavioural economics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[evolutionary game theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

While cultural norms are often beneficial to the individuals who hold them, they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race." Discover Magazine. May. 64-66. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Norms can spread by cultural group selection when they are practiced within successful groups, and norms are more likely to spread from groups that are successful. But, for cultural group selection to occur, there must exist, between groups, cultural differences that when transmitted across time affect the persistence or proliferation of the groups.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, D.T. Variation and selective retention in sociocultural evolution. Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory. Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.&lt;ref name="sol" &gt;Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473–494.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[game theory|game theoretic]] models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="joe" &gt;Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include [[imitation]], [[conformity]], and [[in-group bias]], that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time.

Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed. While altruistic behaviour such as [[kin selection]] and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on [[Observational learning|social learning]] in acquiring behaviours.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164–181&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.&lt;ref name="tomasello"&gt;Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529&lt;/ref&gt; Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum]], [[Dictator game|Dictator]], and [[Third-party punishment]] games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology.

== Human adaptations for culture ==
For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task.&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

[[Michael Tomasello]] suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:&lt;ref name="tomasello" /&gt;

=== Joint attention ===
At around 9–12 months infants begin engaging in [[joint attention]]. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.

=== Imitative learning ===
By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of [[imitative learning]], children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome,&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an [[Andrew Meltzoff]] study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.

=== Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation ===
Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture.

== Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation ==
Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation ''and'' increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‘mechanisms’ are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases.

According to [[Joseph Henrich]], between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Conformist transmission ===
Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.&lt;ref name="Boyd85"&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4),
612–643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task
importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915–927.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt; Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.

=== Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission ===
Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high-prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick "opinion leaders" adopt them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[self-similarity]] transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt;

=== Punishment of non-conformists ===
Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068–1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Gächter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative conformity ===
Normative conformity is the act of changing one’s visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] are a perfect example of how robust this effect is&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International
Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator.

== Mechanisms ==
As [[Donald T. Campbell]] says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; This means groups are selected ''for'' or ''against'' according to their respective ''gains'' or ''losses'' relative to other groups.

Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Demographic swamping ===
Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices.  This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994.

Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500–1000 years for group selection to happen this way.&lt;ref name="sol" /&gt;

=== Prestige-biased group selection ===
In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation.

The '''European Master in Law &amp; Economics''', also known as EMLE, is an [[Erasmus Mundus]] post-graduate [[master's degree]]. It focuses on "interdisciplinary studies of law and economics" and "an advanced understanding of the economic effects of divergent laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emle.org emle.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is offered by a consortium of nine universities: [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] (co-ordinating institution), [[University of Hamburg]], [[University of Bologna]], [[University of Ghent]], [[University of Aix-Marseille]], [[University of Vienna]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and the [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]]. Furthermore, the EMLE maintains a link with the [[University of California, Berkeley]] which allows some students to serve as visiting scholars in residence there.

Students who participate in the EMLE Program usually divide their time between two or three of the participating Universities and, depending on their allocations, can receive multiple-degrees from each institution where they have undertaken studies. The partner universities variously award [[LL.M.]], [[M.Sc.]] or [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degrees. The language of instruction is English, but the master thesis can also be written in another European language.

==History of the programme==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics started in 1990 at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Ghent]], [[Paris Dauphine University]], and [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] with 20 students from a variety of countries. From the very beginning, the Programme received recognition and financial support of the ERASMUS Bureau of the European Community. The partner universities exchanged multilateral agreements to continue their joint venture and made all the necessary arrangements in order to be included in the new SOCRATES framework between the European Commission and the European universities. The number of partner universities has increased rapidly and the network now comprises seven teaching centres within the EU and two internationally.

==Admission==

Admission to the EMLE is extremely selective. Applicants must have a bachelor’s or master's degree in law or economics with high academic merit. Degrees from related disciplines are also acceptable, provided that the curriculum comprises a significant number of courses in law or economics. Preference is given to applicants who already have a first masters or above, and most admitted students already hold advanced degrees.  The demand for a place in the programme has steadily risen.  Given the increase in the number of applications, the acceptance rate is now consistently below 10%. While most students still come from within the E.U., over 30 other countries are represented in each class.

==Structure==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics is the primary source of high quality postgraduate education in the field of the economic analysis of law. The EMLE is designed to provide students with advanced knowledge in the Economic Analysis of Law and to allow them to use economic methods to explain and assess the effects of divergent legal rules. Students study introductory courses and core courses on the major topics in the economic analysis of law.

Students also take specialized courses and write a master thesis. The EMLE includes three kinds of courses: Economic Courses, Comparative Law Courses, and Law and Economics Courses.

Students will become competent to work for private companies, public organizations, as economic advisers, or for large multinational law firms. Graduates are also well prepared for research in Law and Economics. Many EMLE graduates now hold teaching positions in European universities.

==Reputation and accreditation==

The EMLE has been recognized as an Erasmus Mundus Masters Course by a panel of independent academic experts and chosen by the Selection Committee out of 128 proposals.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The European Commission has designated the programme of "outstanding academic quality."{{cn|date=November 2017}} The Master in Law and Economics is the only Masters Course in Economics and one of the two Erasmus Mundus Courses in the legal discipline. In 2002, the EMLE Programme was already selected to take part in the Joint Masters Project of the European University Association (together with 10 other networks). In August 2004, the EMLE program in Rotterdam and Ghent was accredited by the NVAO, the [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders]]. Also in 2004, The EMLE was also included in the list of the eleven best European Joint Masters by the EUA. In February 2005, the EMLE was accredited by ZEvA, the German Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency. The EMLE has participated in the TEEP II Project, which is a form of external quality assurance and The TEEP II Committee showed a very high appreciation of the EMLE. The Israeli economic newspaper [[Haaretz]] classified the EMLE programme as "the most elitist integrated Master program"&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 22 August 2010, Amit Ben - Aroya, "בבוקר משפט מסחרי, בערב שיטוט בפאריס", http://www.themarker.com/law/1.578905&lt;/ref&gt; for law and economics.

==Governance==

The EMLE is organized and governed by Associated Members and a Committee of Patronage, which is composed of public and private research institutions, governmental bodies, law firms and consulting firms, commercial enterprises, and renowned scholars in law and economics.

Associated Members include: [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], [[Deutsche Bank AG]], [[De Nederlandsche Bank]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Deloitte]], [[White &amp; Case LLP]], [[Covington &amp; Burling LLP]], [[Centre for European Policy Studies]], European Association of Law and Economics, [[RiskMetrics]] Group, Joseph von Sonnenfels Center for the Study of Public Law and Economics, [[Bombay Stock Exchange Limited]], and many other notable institutions.

The Committee of Patronage includes world-leading Professors: [[James M. Buchanan]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1985), [[Ronald Coase]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1991), [[Robert Cooter]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), R. Epstein ([[University of Chicago]]), Michael Faure ([[University of Maastricht]]), [[William Landes]] ([[University of Chicago]]), [[Ejan Mackaay]] ([[University of Montréal]]), [[Henry Manne]] (former Dean - [[George Mason University Law School]]), A. Mitchell Polinsky ([[Stanford Law School]]), [[Richard Posner]] ([[University of Chicago]], Chief Judge [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]), Susan Rose-Ackerman ([[Yale Law School]]), Steven Shavell ([[Harvard Law School]]), Cento Veljanovski (Research &amp; Editorial Director of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], London), [[Oliver E. Williamson]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), and O. Zerbe, Jr. ([[University of Washington]]).

==The Midterm Meeting==

The first Midterm Meeting of the EMLE took place in Ghent in 1991. Since then the Midterm Meeting of EMLE has grown to be a multi-facetted event, a symposium of lectures and scientific discussion seminars, informal networking and other social activities. This annual event now rotates between Bologna, Ghent and Hamburg, and also serves as the forum for the EMLE graduation ceremonies. The EMLE Midterm Meeting attracts one of the largest groups of Law and Economics scholars in the world and is widely regarded as one of the leading conferences for law and economics.

The '''''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential''''' is published by the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). It is available online since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=1#qt-encyclopedia UIA Online Encyclopedia]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=2#qt-encyclopedia Hardcover edition of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential].

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/224156 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Scope and challenge]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising]. Union of International Associations.

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples of loops can be seen at [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=7 Transformative approaches project – Analysis: Vicious cycles and loops] and [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=9 Transformative approaches project – Examples of vicious problem cycles and loops]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond the problem-lobby mindset'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=25 World problems project – Comments: beyond the problem-lobby mindset]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Problem perception and levels of awareness''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=28 World problems project – Comments: problem perception and levels of awareness]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy].

Work on the first edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, matching those of the [[Union of International Associations|UIA]]. The publisher [[K G Saur Verlag|Klaus Saur]], of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000.&lt;ref name=backstrat /&gt; In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the ''Encyclopedia'' databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven [[knowledge management]] capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist who has been a primary editor for the ''Encyclopedia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164090 Nadia McLaren].

The ''Encyclopedia'' was the fruit of a continuing processing of documents gathered from many of the thousands of the [[international organization]]s profiled in the ''[[Yearbook of International Organizations]]''. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the ''Encyclopedia''. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades.&lt;ref name=back&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=8 Encyclopedia of world problem and human potential project – Overview: background and acknowledgements].

He reports in ''Encyclopedia Illusions''&lt;ref name=illusions /&gt; how the narrow focus of the [[Club of Rome]] on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.

Anthony Judge was the architect and managing editor of the ''Encyclopedia''. He was also the main author of the notes and commentaries. The principal editors over the years have been, for different editions, Jon Jenkins and Maureen Jenkins (who had also worked at the Institute of Cultural Affairs), Owen Victor, Jacqueline Nebel, Nadia McLaren, and Tomáš Fülöpp. There were also enthusiastic editorial contributions from volunteers. All people related to the UIA who worked directly on one or more of the five ''Encyclopedia'' editions figure on a list that can be found online under the heading ''Associates of the Union of Intelligible Associations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-intelligible.org/associates/ Associates of the Union of Intelligible Associations].

[[Richard Slaughter]] emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php A meta-linguistic resource] Richard A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">An '''Environmental Literacy Plan''' (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]] (NCLI) of 2008 which the House of Representatives passed on September 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by the NCLI of 2008, ELP’s must contain numerous and explicit provisions.

== Definition ==
An Environmental Literacy Plan (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the 2008 [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]] (NCLI)  which the House of Representatives passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State standards, content areas, and courses or subjects ===

Environmental Literacy Plan’s include environmental literacy content standards in grades Pre-K through 12th grade. Curriculum integration of the environmental literacy standards into the curriculum occur through content integration or as standalone topics of learning. "Attention should be paid to mandated learning outcomes and curriculum content, standardized tests, and instructional syllabuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkowitz|first=Alan|title=New Opportunities for ecology education in the United States in Ecology for Education|year=1993|publisher=New Cambridge Press|location=Cambridge|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clear and supported learning standards are required to ensure high school graduates possess a determined degree of environmental literacy.

=== High school graduation requirements ===
One  component of an ELP is the consideration of how environmental literacy will be incorporated into the state’s graduation requirement. Hence high school courses should be aligned with the topic of environmental literacy, programming opportunities for students should be offered or credits for environmental literacy should be a requirement for graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Developing a State Environmental  Literacy Plan|journal=North American Association for Environmental Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional development ===

The ELP provides provisions for both pre-service and in-service teacher preparation. Teacher preparation within the field of environmental literacy will need to support learning using place-based and experiential learning strategies. "The work of reorienting teachers education for the values of sustainability is crucial to creating a new understanding of ourselves and our place in communities, in the living world and in traditions of relational reciprocity that will sustain us all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Patrick|title=Who Will Teach the Teachers in Teaching Sustainability, Teaching Sustainably| year=2012| publisher=Stylus Pub|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment of environmental literacy ===
The initial ELP should contain a detailed description of how the state education agency will assess and measure the learning achieved through the implementation of the ELP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of environmental literacy of students will measure the extent to which the ELP was successful.

=== Implementation and support ===
Key logistical and implementation issues will be addressed within the ELP. One of the most essential components of the ELP is  planning for future funding and support. As designated by the NCLI act of 2008 funding tampers off after the initial year of implementation and eventually reduces to 50% of total program expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3036 (110th): No Child Left Inside Act of 2008|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3036#overview|publisher=govgtrack.us|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ELP outlines and anticipates future sources of funding for the state environmental literacy program. The ELP also considers how federal and state education-related legislation and initiatives such as IDEA or STEM funding will be integrated into the overall environmental literacy program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">The '''European Parliamentary Technology Assessment''' (EPTA) is a network of [[technology assessment]] (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.

[[Image:epta.jpg|thumb|EPTA-Logo]]

== Objectives ==

The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example [[bioethics]] and [[biotechnology]], [[public health]], environment and energy, [[information and communication technologies|ICTs]], and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) of the [[US Congress]]. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of [[technology assessment]] (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.

== History and Organisation ==

The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK’s parliamentary TA office – [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]], under the patronage of the President of the [[European Parliament]], Mr [[Enrique Baron Crespo]]. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA ''Council'' and by meetings of the ''Directors'' of the EPTA partner organisations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organisation. The Council decides on organisational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The ''Presidency'' of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organisation holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.

== Members ==

Parliamentary TA is institutionalised in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organisations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work programme including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA programme and the resources to realise it, but that do not fulfil other criteria for full membership. Associates are involved in all EPTA activities but are not represented in the EPTA Council. Further, other units interested in the work of EPTA can act as observers.

'''Eye tracking''' is the process of measuring either the point of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]] (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An '''eye tracker''' is a device for measuring eye positions and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].  Eye trackers are used in research on the [[visual system]], in psychology, in [[psycholinguistics]], marketing, as an input device for [[human-computer interaction]], and in product design.  There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use [[search coil]]s or are based on the [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]].

[[File:Yarbus eye tracker.jpg|thumb|Yarbus eye tracker from the 1960s.]]

== History ==
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.

In 1879 in Paris, [[Louis Émile Javal]] observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Huey 1908/1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?

[[File:Reading Fixations Saccades.jpg|thumb|left|320px|An example of fixations and saccades over text. This is the typical pattern of eye movement during reading. The eyes never move smoothly over still text.]]
Edmund Huey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huey|first=Edmund|title=The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Reprint)|publisher=MIT Press 1968 (originally published 1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the [[pupil]]. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

The first non-intrusive eye-trackers were built by Guy Thomas Buswell in Chicago, using beams of light that were reflected on the eye and then recording them on film. Buswell made systematic studies into reading&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1922, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and picture viewing.&lt;ref&gt;(1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; did important eye tracking research and his 1967 book is often quoted. He showed that the task given to a subject has a very large influence on the subject's eye movement. He also wrote about the relation between fixations and interest:

:"All the records ... show conclusively that the character of the eye movement is either completely independent of or only very slightly dependent on the material of the picture and how it was made, provided that it is flat or nearly flat."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical pattern in the examination of pictures "is dependent on not only what is shown on the picture, but also the problem facing the observer and the information that he hopes to gain from the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yarbus The Visitor.jpg|thumb|right|320px|This study by {{Harvtxt|Yarbus|1967}} is often referred to as evidence on how the task given to a person influences his or her eye movement.]]
:"Records of eye movements show that the observer's attention is usually held only by certain elements of the picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so the observer's thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying the examination of the particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract the observer's eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"/&gt;

:"The observer's attention is frequently drawn to elements which do not give important information but which, in his opinion, may do so. Often an observer will focus his attention on elements that are unusual in the particular circumstances, unfamiliar, incomprehensible, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... when changing its points of fixation, the observer's eye repeatedly returns to the same elements of the picture. Additional time spent on perception is not used to examine the secondary elements, but to reexamine the most important elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eye tracking thru glass.JPG|thumb|320px|This study by Hunziker (1970)&lt;ref&gt;Hunziker, H. W. (1970). Visuelle Informationsaufnahme und Intelligenz: Eine Untersuchung über die Augenfixationen beim Problemlösen. Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Psychologie und ihre Anwendungen, 1970, 29, Nr 1/2 (english abstract: http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm )&lt;/ref&gt; on ''eye tracking in problem solving'' used simple 8&amp;nbsp;mm film to track eye movement by filming the subject through a glass plate on which the visual problem was displayed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/eye movements problem solving.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learning-systems.ch/multimedia/forsch1e.htm|title=Visual Perception: Eye Movements in Problem Solving.|website=www.learning-systems.ch|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 1970s, eye-tracking research expanded rapidly, particularly reading research. A good overview of the research in this period is given by [[Dr. Keith Rayner|Rayner]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Just and Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;Just and Carpenter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the influential ''Strong eye-mind hypothesis'', that "there is no appreciable lag between what is fixated and what is processed". If this hypothesis is correct, then when a subject looks at a word or object, he or she also thinks about it (process cognitively), and for exactly as long as the recorded fixation. The hypothesis is often taken for granted by researchers using eye-tracking. However, [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent techniques]] offer an interesting option in order to disentangle overt and covert attentions, to differentiate what is fixated and what is processed.

During the 1980s, the eye-mind hypothesis was often questioned in light of covert attention,&lt;ref&gt;Posner (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright &amp; Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the attention to something that one is not looking at, which people often do. If covert attention is common during eye-tracking recordings, the resulting scan-path and fixation patterns would often show not where our attention has been, but only where the eye has been looking, failing to indicate cognitive processing.

The 1980s also saw the birth of using eye-tracking to answer questions related to human-computer interaction.  Specifically, researchers investigated how users search for commands in computer menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, computers allowed researchers to use eye-tracking results in real time, primarily to help disabled users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf%5D,|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, there has been growth in using eye tracking to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"/&gt;  The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface. Yet another recent area of research focuses on Web development. This can include how users react to drop-down menus or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmi-interaktiv.de/uploads/media/MMI-Interaktiv0303_SchiesslDudaThoelkeFischer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffman,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998&lt;/ref&gt; current consensus is that visual attention is always slightly (100 to 250 ms) ahead of the eye. But as soon as attention moves to a new position, the eyes will want to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0W-3VXNHBP-10&amp;_user=952938&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049220&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=952938&amp;md5=4f7fbf4f015fde59aa9a39b30154e7f3 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00294-4 | volume=36 | title=Saccade target selection and object recognition: Evidence for a common attentional mechanism | year=1996 | journal=Vision Research | pages=1827–1837 | last1 = Deubel | first1 = Heiner | pmid=8759451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We still cannot infer specific cognitive processes directly from a fixation on a particular object in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Holsanova 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a fixation on a face in a picture may indicate recognition, liking, dislike, puzzlement etc. Therefore, eye tracking is often coupled with other methodologies, such as [[Protocol analysis|introspective verbal protocols]].

== Tracker types ==
Eye-trackers measure rotations of the eye in one of several ways, but principally they fall into three categories: (i) measurement of the movement of an object (normally, a special contact lens) attached to the eye; (ii) optical tracking without direct contact to the eye; and (iii) measurement of electric potentials using electrodes placed around the eyes.

=== Eye-attached tracking ===
The first type uses an attachment to the eye, such as a special contact lens with an embedded mirror or magnetic field sensor, and the movement of the attachment is measured with the assumption that it does not slip significantly as the eye rotates. Measurements with tight-fitting contact lenses have provided extremely sensitive recordings of eye movement, and magnetic search coils are the method of choice for researchers studying the dynamics and underlying physiology of eye movement. This method allows the measurement of eye movement in horizontal, vertical and torsion directions.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Robinson: A method of measuring eye movement using a scleral search coil in a magnetic field, IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Electronics, October 1963, 137–145 ([http://ebooks.yasse.ir/ebooks/IEEE_Journals/Bio-Medical_Electronics_IRE_T/A_Method_of_Measuring_Eye_Movemnent_Using_a_Scieral_Search_Coil_in_a_Magnetic_Field-274.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical tracking ===
[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye-tracking [[head-mounted display]]. Each eye has an LED light source (gold-color metal) on the side of the display lens, and a camera under the display lens.]]
The second broad category uses some non-contact, optical method for measuring eye motion. Light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a video camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Video-based eye trackers typically use the corneal reflection (the first [[Purkinje images|Purkinje image]]) and the center of the pupil as features to track over time. A more sensitive type of eye-tracker, the dual-Purkinje eye tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.000527|last=Crane|first=H.D.|author2=Steele, C.M.|title=Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image eyetracker|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=527–537|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses reflections from the front of the cornea (first Purkinje image) and the back of the lens (fourth Purkinje image) as features to track. A still more sensitive method of tracking is to image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Optical methods, particularly those based on video recording, are widely used for gaze-tracking and are favored for being non-invasive and inexpensive.

=== Electric potential measurement ===
The third category uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are the origin of a steady electric potential field which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called [[EOG|Electrooculogram (EOG)]]. If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup, two separate movement components – a horizontal and a vertical – can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel,&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., Lutzenberger, W., Rockstroh, B., Birbaumer, N., 1985. Removal of ocular artifacts from the EEG. A biophysical approach to the EOG. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 60, 455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keren | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Yuval-Greenberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Deouell | first3 = L.Y. | year = 2010 | title = Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 2248–2263 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057 | pmid=19874901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to potential drifts and variable relations between the EOG signal amplitudes and the saccade sizes, it is challenging to use EOG for measuring slow eye movement and detecting gaze direction. EOG is, however, a very robust technique for measuring [[saccade|saccadic eye movement]] associated with gaze shifts and detecting [[blink]]s. 
Contrary to video-based eye-trackers, EOG allows recording of eye movements even with eyes closed, and can thus be used in sleep research. It is a very light-weight approach that, in contrast to current video-based eye-trackers, requires only very low computational power; works under different lighting conditions; and can be implemented as an embedded, self-contained wearable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulling|first=A. |author2=Roggen, D. |author3=Tröster, G.|year=2009|title=Wearable EOG goggles: Seamless sensing and context-awareness in everyday environments|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments (JAISE)|volume=1|pages=157–171|issue=2|doi=10.3233/AIS-2009-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus the method of choice for measuring eye movement in mobile daily-life situations and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] phases during sleep.  The major disadvantage of EOG is its relatively poor gaze-direction accuracy compared to a video tracker.  That is, it is difficult to determine with good accuracy exactly where a subject is looking, though the time of eye movements can be determined.

==Technologies and techniques==

The most widely used current designs are video-based eye-trackers. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the center of the pupil and [[infrared]] / [[near-infrared]] non-collimated light to create [[corneal reflection]]s (CR). The vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the individual is usually needed before using the eye tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzner Hansen|first=Dan|author2=Qiang Ji|title=In the Eye of the Beholder: A Survey of Models for Eyes and Gaze|journal=IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.|date=March 2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=478–500|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1729561|doi=10.1109/tpami.2009.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general types of infrared / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye-tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is [[coaxial]] with the optical path, then the eye acts as a [[retroreflector]] as the light reflects off the [[retina]] creating a bright pupil effect similar to [[Red-eye effect|red eye]]. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.&lt;ref name=gneo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gneo|first1=Massimo|last2=Schmid|first2=Maurizio|last3=Conforto|first3=Silvia|last4=D’Alessio|first4=Tommaso|title=A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-9-82}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright-pupil tracking creates greater iris/pupil contrast, allowing more robust eye-tracking with all iris pigmentation, and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye: A Survey of Human Vision; Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright.

Another, less used, method is known as passive light. It uses visible light to illuminate, something which may cause some distractions to users.&lt;ref name=gneo/&gt; Another challenge with this method is that the contrast of the pupil is less than in the active light methods, therefore, the center of [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is used for calculating the vector instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigut|first1=J|last2=Sidha|first2=SA|title=Iris center corneal reflection method for gaze tracking using visible light.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering|date=February 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=411–9|pmid=20952326|doi=10.1109/tbme.2010.2087330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This calculation needs to detect the boundary of the iris and the white [[sclera]] ([[Corneal limbus|limbus]] tracking). It presents another challenge for vertical eye movements due to obstruction of eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=H|last2=Krishnaswamy|first2=P|last3=Rolland|first3=JP|title=Video-based eyetracking methods and algorithms in head-mounted displays.|journal=Optics Express|date=15 May 2006|volume=14|issue=10|pages=4328–50|pmid=19516585|doi=10.1364/oe.14.004328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye-tracking setups vary greatly: some are head-mounted, some require the head to be stable (for example, with a chin rest), and some function remotely and automatically track the head during motion.  Most use a sampling rate of at least 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Although 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz is more common, today many video-based eye trackers run at 240, 350 or even 1000/1250&amp;nbsp;Hz, speeds needed in order to capture fixational eye movements or correctly measure saccade dynamics.

Eye movements are typically divided into [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] and saccades – when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a [[scanpath]]. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include [[microsaccade]]s: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purves |first=D |author2=st al. |date=2001 |title=Neuroscience, 2d ed. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11156/ |location=Sunderland (MA)|publisher=Sinauer Assocs. |page=What Eye Movements Accomplish|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience.  Other biological factors (some as simple as gender) may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes, or as a method of input in [[gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent displays]], also known as [[gaze-based interfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Majaranta, P., Aoki, H., Donegan, M., Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A., Räihä, K.J., ''Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies'', IGI Global, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data presentation ==

Interpretation of the data that is recorded by the various types of eye-trackers employs a variety of software that animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior of one or more users can be graphically resumed. The video is generally manually coded to identify the AOIs(Area Of Interests) or recently using artificial intelligence. Graphical presentation is rarely the basis of research results, since they are limited in terms of what can be analysed - research relying on eye-tracking, for example, usually requires quantitative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters, The following visualisations are the most commonly used:

'''Animated representations of a point on the interface'''
This method is used when the visual behavior is examined individually indicating where the user focused their gaze in each moment, complemented with a small path that indicates the previous saccade movements, as seen in the image.

'''Static representations of the saccade path'''
This is fairly similar to the one described above, with the difference that this is static method. A higher level of expertise than with the animated ones is required to interpret this.

'''Heat maps'''
An alternative static representation, used mainly for the agglomerated analysis of the visual exploration patterns in a group of users. In these representations, the ‘hot’ zones or zones with higher density designate where the users focused their gaze (not their attention) with a higher frequency. Heat maps are the best known visualization technique for eyetracking studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. Pernice, Kara. (2010).

'''Blind zones maps, or focus maps'''
This method is a simplified version of the Heat maps where the visually less attended zones by the users are displayed clearly, thus allowing for an easier understanding of the most relevant information, that is to say, we are informed about which zones were not seen by the users.

== Eye-tracking vs. gaze-tracking ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gaze Tracking Example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of eye gaze trace overlay.]] --&gt;Eye-trackers necessarily measure the rotation of the eye with respect to some frame of reference. This is usually tied to the measuring system. Thus, if the measuring system is head-mounted, as with EOG or a video-based system mounted to a helmet, then eye-in-head angles are measured. To deduce the line of sight in world coordinates, the head must be kept in a constant position or its movements must be tracked as well. In these cases, head direction is added to eye-in-head direction to determine gaze direction.

If the measuring system is table-mounted, as with scleral search coils or table-mounted camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, in these situations head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head-centered reference frame is identical to a world-centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye-in-head position directly determines the gaze direction.

Some results are available on human eye movements under natural conditions where head movements are allowed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einhäuser | first1 = W | last2 = Moeller | first2 = GU | last3 = Schumann | first3 = F | last4 = Conradt | first4 = J | last5 = Vockeroth | first5 = J | last6 = Bartl | first6 = K | last7 = Schneider | first7 = E | last8 = König | first8 = P | year = 2009 | title = Eye-head coordination during free exploration in human and cat | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1164 | issue = | pages = 353–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhäuser W, Schumann F, Bardins S, Bartl K, Böning G, Schneider E and König P (2007).

== Eye tracking in practice ==
A great deal of research has gone into studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of eye rotation, but the goal of eye- tracking is most often to estimate gaze direction. Users may be interested in what features of an image draw the eye, for example. It is important to realize that the eye-tracker does not provide absolute gaze direction, but rather can measure only changes in gaze direction. In order to know precisely what a subject is looking at, some calibration procedure is required in which the subject looks at a point or series of points, while the eye tracker records the value that corresponds to each gaze position. (Even those techniques that track features of the retina cannot provide exact gaze direction because there is no specific anatomical feature that marks the exact point where the visual axis meets the retina, if indeed there is such a single, stable point.) An accurate and reliable calibration is essential for obtaining valid and repeatable eye movement data, and this can be a significant challenge for non-verbal subjects or those who have unstable gaze.

Each method of eye-tracking has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of an eye-tracking system depends on considerations of cost and application. There are offline methods and online procedures like [[AttentionTracking]]. There is a trade-off between cost and sensitivity, with the most sensitive systems costing many tens of thousands of dollars and requiring considerable expertise to operate properly. Advances in computer and video technology have led to the development of relatively low-cost systems that are useful for many applications and fairly easy to use. Interpretation of the results still requires some level of expertise, however, because a misaligned or poorly calibrated system can produce wildly erroneous data.

===Eye-tracking while driving a car in a difficult situation===

[[Image:Eye movements of drivers.jpg|300px | frame| right |Frames from narrow road eye tracking described in this section&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}} Based on data from:Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The eye movement of two groups of drivers have been filmed with a special head camera by a team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: Novice and experienced drivers had their eye-movement recorded while approaching a bend of a narrow road.
The series of images has been condensed from the original film frames&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt; to show 2 eye fixations per image for better comprehension.

Each of these stills corresponds to approximately 0.5 seconds in realtime.

The series of images shows an example of eye fixations #9 to #14 of a typical novice and an experienced driver.

Comparison of the top images shows that the experienced driver checks the curve and even has Fixation No. 9 left to look aside while the novice driver needs to check the road and estimate his distance to the parked car.

In the middle images, the experienced driver is now fully concentrating on the location where an oncoming car could be seen. The novice driver concentrates his view on the parked car.

In the bottom image the novice is busy estimating the distance between the left wall and the parked car, while the experienced driver can use his [[peripheral vision]] for that and still concentrate his view on the dangerous point of the curve: If a car appears there, he has to give way, i. e. stop to the right instead of passing the parked car.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from: Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-tracking of younger and elderly people while walking===

While walking, elderly subjects depend more on foveal vision than do younger subjects. Their walking speed is decreased by a limited [[visual field]], probably caused by a deteriorated peripheral vision.

Younger subjects make use of both their central and peripheral vision while walking. Their peripheral vision allows faster control over the process of walking.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh N, Fukuda T. (2002) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1283 Comparative study of eye movement in extent of central and peripheral vision and use by young and elderly walkers]. ''Percept Mot Skills.'' 2002 Jun;94(3 Pt 2):1283–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of disciplines use eye-tracking techniques, including [[cognitive science]]; [[psychology]] (notably [[psycholinguistics]]; the visual world paradigm); [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI); [[human factors and ergonomics]]; [[marketing research]] and medical research (neurological diagnosis). Specific applications include the tracking eye movement in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], [[eye movement in music reading|music reading]], human [[activity recognition]], the perception of advertising, and the playing of sports.

===Commercial applications===
In recent years, the increased sophistication and accessibility of eye-tracking technologies have generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. Applications include [[web usability]], advertising, sponsorship, package design and automotive engineering. In general, commercial eye-tracking studies function by presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites; television programs; sporting events; films and commercials; magazines and newspapers; packages; shelf displays; consumer systems (ATMs, checkout systems, kiosks); and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, [[saccades]], pupil dilation, blinks and a variety of other behaviors, researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product. While some companies complete this type of research internally, there are many private companies that offer eye-tracking services and analysis.

One of the most prominent fields of commercial eye-tracking research is web usability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye-tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks, thereby providing valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye-tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye-tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials, print ads, online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with current eye-tracking technology. For instance in newspapers, eye-tracking studies can be used to find out in what way advertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the reader’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktracker.com/blog/eye-tracking-case-study/eye-tracking-study-the-new-york-times-vs-the-wall-street-journal|title=LookTracker - Eye Tracking Services|website=www.looktracker.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine, newspaper, website, or televised event. One example is an analysis of eye movements over advertisements in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. The study focused on what particular features caused people to notice an ad, whether they viewed ads in a particular order and how viewing times varied. The study revealed that ad size, graphics, color, and copy all influence attention to advertisements. Knowing this allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo, product or ad. As a result, an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohse |first=Gerald |last2=Wu |first2=D.

'''Nanoscale iron particles''' are sub-micrometer particles of [[iron]] metal. They are highly [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] because of their large surface area. In the presence of oxygen and water, they rapidly [[oxidize]] to form free iron [[ion]]s. They are widely used in medical and laboratory applications and have also been studied for remediation of industrial sites contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds.
== Synthesis ==
Iron nanoparticles can be synthesized by the reduction of Fe(II) or Fe(III) salt with [[sodium borohydride]] in an aqueous medium.


[[File:Reduction of Fe(III).gif]]

== Reactivity ==
When exposed to oxygen and water, iron oxidizes. This [[redox]] process can occur under either [[acid]]ic or neutral/[[Base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions:

:2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(s) + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

: Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(s) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (aq) → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

==Research==
Research has shown that nanoscale iron particles can be effectively used to treat several forms of [[ground contamination]], including grounds contaminated by [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), chlorinated organic solvents, and [[organochlorine]] pesticides.  Nanoscale iron particle are easily transportable through ground water, allowing for [[In_situ#Biology|in situ]] treatment.  Additionally, the nanoparticle-water slurry can be injected into the contaminated area and stay there for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Wei-xian |year=2003 |title=Nanoscale iron particles for environmental remediation: an overview |journal=[[Journal of Nanoparticle Research]] |volume=5 |pages=323–332 |doi=10.1023/A:1025520116015 |issue=3/4|bibcode=2003JNR.....5..323Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors combine to make this method of cheaper than most currently used alternative.

Researchers have found that although metallic iron nanoparticles remediate contaminants well, they tend to agglomerate on the soil surfaces.  In response, [[carbon nanoparticles]] and water-soluble [[polyelectrolyte]]s have been used as supports to the metallic iron nanoparticles.  The [[hydrophobic]] contaminants adsorb to these supports, improving permeability in sand and soil.&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;

In field tests have generally confirmed lab findings.  However, research is still ongoing and nanoscale iron particles are not yet commonly used for treating ground contamination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18630">'''Limbic resonance''' is the idea that the capacity for sharing deep emotional states arises from the [[limbic system]] of the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9Z1yGXyoaQC&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hope in the Age of Anxiety|last=Scioli|first=Anthony|last2=Biller|first2=Henry|page=154|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-538035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states include the [[dopamine]] circuit-promoted feelings of [[empathy|empathic]] harmony, and the [[norepinephrine]] circuit-originated emotional states of fear, anxiety and anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2008|title=The Political Mind : Why You Can't Understand 21st-Century American Politics with an 18th-Century Brain|last=Lakoff|first=George|authorlink=George Lakoff|isbn=978-0-670-01927-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was advanced in the book ''[[A General Theory of Love]]'' (2000), and is one of three interrelated concepts central to the book's premise: that our brain chemistry and nervous systems are measurably affected by those closest to us ('''limbic resonance'''); that our systems synchronize with one another in a way that has profound implications for personality and lifelong emotional health ('''limbic regulation'''); and that these set patterns can be modified through therapeutic practice ('''limbic revision''').&lt;ref name ="Lewis2000"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Richard Lannon |author2=Fari Amini |author3=Thomas Lewis  | title=A general theory of love | date=2000 | publisher=Random House | location=New York  | isbn=0-375-50389-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}}

In other words, it refers to the capacity for [[empathy]] and non-verbal connection that is present in mammals, and that forms the basis of our social connections as well as the foundation for various modes of therapy and healing. According to the authors (Thomas Lewis, M.D, Fari Amini, M.D. and Richard Lannon, M.D.), our [[nervous system]]s are not self-contained, but rather demonstrably attuned to those around us with whom we share a close connection. "Within the effulgence of their new brain, mammals developed a capacity we call 'limbic resonance' — a symphony of mutual exchange and internal adaptation whereby two mammals become attuned to each other's inner states."&lt;ref name ="Lewis2000"/&gt;

This notion of limbic resonance builds on previous formulations and similar ideas. For example, the authors retell at length the notorious experiments of [[Harry Harlow]] establishing the importance of physical contact and affection in social and cognitive development of rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harlow | first = H.F. | title = The Nature of Love | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 13 | pages = 673–685 | year = 1958 | doi = 10.1037/h0047884 | issue = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also make extensive use of subsequent research by [[Tiffany Field]] in mother/infant contact,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Field | first = Tiffany | title = Attachment as psychobiological attunement; being on the same wavelength | editor-last = Reite | editor-first = M | journal = The Psychobiology of Attachment and Separation | publisher = Academic Press, New York | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Field | first = Tiffany | title = Touch in Early Development | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | isbn = 0-8058-1890-1 | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul D.

Kraemer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Kraemer, GW | title =  A psychobiological theory of attachment | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 5 | pages = 493–541 | year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance and history ==

Lewis, Amini and Lannon first make their case by examining a story from the dawn of scientific experimentation in human development—albeit heinously misguided—when in the thirteenth century Frederick II raised a group of infants to be completely cut off from human interaction, other than the most basic care and feeding, so as to discover what language would spontaneously arise in the absence of any communication prompts. The result of this notorious experiment was that the infants, deprived of any human discourse or affection, all died.&lt;ref name ="Lewis2000"/&gt;{{rp|68,69}}

The authors find the hegemony of Freudian theory in the early days of psychology and psychiatry to be almost as harmful as the ideas of Frederick II.  They condemn the focus on cerebral insight, and the ideal of a cold, emotionless analyst, as negating the very benefit that psychotherapy can confer by virtue of the empathetic bond and neurological reconditioning that can occur in the course of sustained therapeutic sessions.  "Freud's enviable advantage is that he never seriously undertook to follow his own advice.  Many promising young therapists have their responsiveness expunged, as they are taught to be dutifully neutral observers, avoiding emotional contact....But since therapy is limbic relatedness, emotional neutrality drains life out of the process..."&lt;ref name ="Lewis2000"/&gt;{{rp|184}}

''A General Theory of Love'' is scarcely more sympathetic to Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]] and his "monumentally influential volume" ''[[The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care|Baby and Child Care]]'', especially given Spock's role in promoting the movement against [[co-sleeping]], or allowing infants to sleep in the same bed as their parents. Lewis, Amini and Lannon cite the research of sleep scientist James McKenna, which seems to suggest that the limbic regulation between sleeping parents and infants is essential to the neurological development of the latter and a major factor in preventing [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS). "The temporal unfolding of particular sleep stages and awake periods of the mother and infant become entwined....on a minute to minute basis, throughout the night, much sensory communication is occurring between them."&lt;ref name ="Lewis2000"/&gt;{{rp|195}}

==Subsequent use of the term==
Since the first publication of ''A General Theory of Love'' in 2000, the term limbic resonance has gained popularity with subsequent writers and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche |author2=Eric Swanson | title = The Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness | publisher = Three Rivers Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-307-34731-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term brings a higher degree of specificity to the ongoing discourse in psychological literature concerning the importance of [[empathy]] and relatedness. In "A handbook of Psychology" (2003) a clear path is traced from Winnicott 1965 identifying the concept of mother and child as a relational organism or dyad&lt;ref&gt;("there is no such thing as an infant")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weiner2003"&gt;{{Citation | author=[[Irving B. Weiner|Weiner, Irving B.]] |author2=Freedheim, Donald K. |author3=Schinka, John A. |author4=Velicer, Wayne F. |author5=[[Irving B. Weiner]] |author6=Donald K. Freedheim |author7=Richard M. Lerner |author8=John A. Schinka |author9=M. Ann Easterbrooks |author10=Wayne F. Velicer |author11=Jayanthi Mistry |title=Handbook of psychology | year=2003 | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | isbn=0-471-38405-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref&gt;Tobach &amp; Schneirla 1968 ("The young of the human species cannot thrive outside of a relational context")&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to examine the interrelation of social and emotional responding with neurological development and the role of the limbic system in regulating response to stress.&lt;ref name="weiner2003"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Limbic resonance is also referred to as "empathic resonance", as in the book ''Empathy in Mental Illness'' (2007), which establishes the centrality of empathy or lack thereof in a range of individual and social pathologies. The authors Farrow and Woodruff cite the work of Maclean, 1985, as establishing that "Empathy is perhaps the heart of mammalian development, limbic regulation and social organization",&lt;ref name="farrow2007"&gt;{{Citation |author1=F. D. Farrow, Tom |author2=W. R. Woodruff, Peter | title=Empathy in Mental Illness | year= 2007 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-84734-6 | pages=51, 313–314.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} as well as research by Carr et al., 2003, who used [[fMRI]] to map brain activity during the observation and imitation of emotional facial expressions, concluding that "we understand the feelings of others via a mechanism of action representation that shapes emotional content and that our empathic resonance is grounded in the experience of our bodies in action and the emotions associated with specific bodily movements".&lt;ref name="farrow2007"/&gt;{{rp|179}} Other studies cited examine the link between [[mirror neuron]]s (activated during such mimicking activity) and the limbic system, such as Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 1999: "Mirror neurone areas seem to monitor this interdependence, this intimacy, this sense of collective agency that comes out of social interactions and that is tightly linked to the ability to form empathic resonance."&lt;ref name="farrow2007"/&gt;{{rp|317}}

Limbic resonance and limbic regulation are also referred to as "mood contagion" or "[[emotional contagion]]" as in the work of Sigal Barsade and colleagues at the Yale School of Management.&lt;ref name ="Barsade2002"/&gt;
In ''The Wise Heart'', Buddhist teacher [[Jack Kornfield]] echoes the musical metaphor of the original definition of "limbic resonance" offered by authors Lewis, Amini and Lannon of ''[[A General Theory of Love]]'', and correlates these findings of Western psychology with the tenets of Buddhism: "Each time we meet another human being and honor their dignity, we help those around us. Their hearts resonate with ours in exactly the same way the strings of an unplucked violin vibrate with the sounds of a violin played nearby. Western psychology has documented this phenomenon of 'mood contagion' or limbic resonance. If a person filled with panic or hatred walks into a room, we feel it immediately, and unless we are very mindful, that person's negative state will begin to overtake our own. When a joyfully expressive person walks into a room, we can feel that state as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology | author= Jack Kornfield | publisher = Random House, Inc. | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-553-80347-6 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, citing ''[[A General Theory of Love]]'', Kevin Slavin referred to limbic resonance in considering the dynamics of [[Social television]]. Slavin suggests that the [[laugh track]] evolved to provide the audience—alone at home—with a sense that others around them were laughing, and that limbic resonance explains the need for that laughing audience.

==Limbic regulation==
Limbic regulation, mood contagion or emotional contagion is the effect of contact with other people upon the development and stability of personality and mood.

=== Subsequent use and definitions of the term ===

In ''Living a connected life'' (2003), Dr. Kathleen Brehony looks at recent brain research which shows the importance of proximity of others in our development. "Especially in infancy, but throughout our lives, our physical bodies are influencing and being influenced by others with whom we feel a connection.  Scientists call this ''limbic regulation.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author= Brehony, Kathleen A. | title=Living a connected life: creating and maintaining relationships that last | date=2003 | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. | location=New York  | isbn=0-8050-7023-0 | page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brehony goes on to describe the parallels between the "protest/despair" cycles of an abandoned puppy and human development. Mammals have developed a tendency to experience distraction, anxiety and measurable levels of stress in response to separation from their care-givers and companions, precisely because such separation has historically constituted a threat to their survival. As anyone who has owned a puppy can attest, when left alone it will cry, bark, howl, and seek to rejoin its human or canine companions. If these efforts are unsuccessful and the isolation is prolonged, it will sink into a state of dejection and despair. The marginal effectiveness of placing a ticking clock in the puppy's bed is based on a universal need in mammals to synchronize to the rhythms of their fellow creatures.

Limbic resonance and limbic regulation are also referred to as "mood contagion" or "emotional contagion" as in the work of Sigal Barsade. Barsade and colleagues at the Yale School of Management build on research in social cognition, and find that some emotions, especially positive ones, are spread more easily than others through such "interpersonal limbic regulation".&lt;ref name ="Barsade2002"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Daniel Goleman has explored similar terrain across several works: in ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995), an international best seller, ''The Joy Of Living,'' coauthored with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, and the ''Harvard Business Review on Breakthrough Leadership''. In the latter book, Goleman considers the "open loop nature of the brain's limbic system" which depends on external sources to manage itself, and examines the implications of interpersonal limbic regulation and the science of moods on leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Goleman, Dan |author2=Peace, William J. |author3=Pagonis, William G. |author4=Peters, Tom F. |author5=Jones, Gareth Stedman |author6=Collingwood, Harris | title=Harvard Business Review on Breakthrough Leadership | publisher=Harvard Business School Press | isbn=1-57851-805-9 | pages= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mindfully Green: A Personal and Spiritual Guide to Whole Earth Thinking'' (2003) author Staphine Kaza defines the term as follows: "Limbic regulation is a mutual simultaneous exchange of body signals that unfolds between people who are deeply involved with each other, especially parents and children." She goes on to correlate love with limbic engagement and asserts that children raised with love learn and remember better than those who are abused. Kaza then proposes to "take this work a step further from a systems perspective, and imagine that a child learns through some sort of limbic regulation with nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kaza | first=Stephanie | authorlink=Stephanie Kaza | title=Mindfully Green: A Personal and Spiritual Guide to Whole Earth Thinking | date= 2008| publisher=Shambhala | isbn=1-59030-583-3 | pages=45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limbic revision==
Limbic revision is the therapeutic alteration of personality residing in the human [[limbic system]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Joy Of Living|author1=Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche |author2=Yongey Mingyur |author3=Eric Swanson |author4=Daniel Goleman |year=2008|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to affect regulation and limbic resonance===
Dr. [[Allan Schore]], of the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, has explored related ideas beginning with his book ''Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self'' published in 1994. Dr. Shore looks at the contribution of the limbic system to the preservation of the species, its role in forming social bonds with other members of the species and intimate relations leading to reproduction. "It is said that natural selection favors characteristics that maximize an individual's contribution of the gene pool of succeeding generations. In humans this may entail not so much competitive and aggressive traits as an ability to enter into a positive affective relationship with a member of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self: The Neurobiology of Emotional Development | author = Allan N. Schore | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8058-3459-1 | page = 255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his subsequent book ''Affect regulation &amp; the repair of the self'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Affect regulation &amp; the repair of the self | author = Allan N. Schore | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | year = 2003 | page = 48|isbn = 0-393-70407-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schor correlates the "interactive transfer of affect" between mother and infant, on the one hand, and in a therapeutic context on the other, and describes it as "intersubjectivity". He then goes on to explore what developmental neuropsychology can reveal about both types of interrelatedness.

In ''Integrative Medicine: Principles for Practice'', authors Kligler and Lee state "The empathic therapist offers a form of affect regulation. The roots of empathy — Limbic resonance — are found in the early caregiver experiences, which shape the ways the child learns to experience, share, and communicate affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Integrative Medicine: Principles for Practice | author = Benjamin Kligler |author2=Roberta A. Lee | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-07-140239-X | page = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbic Resonance in cinematography and tv series ==

=== Sense8, Netflix Series ===
''Limbic Resonance'' is the title of the first episode of the first series of ''[[Sense8]],'' written and directed by Lana and Lilly [[The Wachowskis|Wachowski]] and [[J. Michael Straczynski]] for [[Netflix]]. The series was broadcast in 2015, and it tells the story of 8 characters living in 8 different places. The first episode, ''Limbic Resonance'' describes how after inexplicably seeing a vision of a woman that they have never met before, eight uniquely different people from across the globe start seeing and hearing things that they have not experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wachowski|first=Lana|title=Limbic Resonance|date=2015-06-05|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3818888/|last2=Wachowski|first2=Lilly|others=Aml Ameen, Doona Bae, Jamie Clayton|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Kolloid- und Grenzflächenforschung'') is located in Potsdam-Golm Science Park in [[Golm (Potsdam)|Golm]], [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]]. It was founded in 1990 as a successor of the Institute for Physical Chemistry and for Organic Chemistry, both in [[Berlin]]-[[Adlershof]], and for Polymer Chemistry in [[Teltow]]. In 1999, it transferred to newly constructed extension facilities in Golm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/history |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft'').

==Research==
Being part of the Max Planck Society, the institute examines [[nanostructure|nano-]] and [[microstructure]]s specifically [[colloids]] in which many are found in nature. With discoveries, scientists create tiny [[apatite|apatite crystals]] in [[bones]], [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s formed out of [[membrane]]s, pores in membranes for [[fuel cells]] and [[microcapsules]] as vehicles for [[medical drugs]] - all are larger than an [[atom]], yet too small to be seen with the [[naked eye]]. The scientists at the Potsdam-based Institute endeavor to understand how they are composed and how they work in order to imitate behavior in new materials or in [[vaccines]], for example. Understanding the function of these structures can also help to identify the causes of certain diseases that occur when the folding of membranes or the transport of materials in cells fails to work properly.

==Departments==

===Colloid Chemistry===
The Colloid Chemistry department, headed by Markus Antonietti, deals with the synthesis of various colloidal structures in the nanometer range. This includes inorganic and metallic nanoparticles, polymers and peptide structural units, their micelles and organised phases, as well as emulsions and foams. Colloid chemistry is able to create materials with a structural hierarchy through appropriate functionalized colloids. This creates new characteristics through the "teamwork" of the functional groups. With appropriate architecture, these colloids can fulfill very specialized tasks. Single molecular systems cannot do this, due to their lack of complexity. An example for this is skin: There is no synthetic material which is as soft and simultaneously so tear-resistant and yet is made mainly of water. The secret of this also lies in the interaction between three components (collagen, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan). This unusual combination of characteristics is only made possible by forming a superstructure "in a team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/145657/Colloid_Chemistry |title=Colloid chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomaterials===
The Department of Biomaterials, headed by [[Peter Fratzl]], focuses on interdisciplinary research in the field of biological and biomimetic materials. The emphasis is on understanding how the mechanical or other physical properties are governed by structure and composition and how they adopt to environmental conditions. Furthermore, research on natural materials (such as bone or wood) has potential applications in many fields. First, design concepts for new materials may be improved by learning from Nature. Second, the understanding of basic mechanisms by which the structure of bone or connective tissue is optimized opens the way for studying diseases and, thus, for contributing to diagnosis and development of treatment strategies. A third option is to use structures grown by Nature and transform them by physical or chemical treatment into technically relevant materials (biotemplating). Given the complexity of natural materials, new approaches for structural characterization are needed. Some of these are further developed in the Department, in particular for studying hierarchical structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/133578/Biomaterials |title=Biomaterials |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory and Bio-Systems===
The Department of Theory and Bio-Systems, headed by Reinhard Lipowsky, investigates the structure and dynamics of molecules, colloids and nanoparticles in biological and biomimetic systems. The molecular building blocks of these systems assemble "by themselves" and form a variety of supramolecular nanostructures, which then interact to produce even larger structures and networks. These complex processes represent hidden dimensions of selforganization since they are difficult to observe on the relevant length and time scales.

Current research focuses on molecular recognition, energy conversion and transport by molecular motors, dynamics of transcription and translation, as well as self-organization of filaments and membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/164482/Theory_Bio-Systems |title=Theory bio-systems |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaces===
The Department of Interfaces, headed by Helmuth Möhwald, is primarily motivated to understand molecular interfaces and to relate this to colloidal systems which are by nature determined by the large surface/volume ratio. Consequently, the strength of the department in characterizing planar or quasi-planar interfaces has been increased and in addition it has been tried successfully to transfer this knowledge to curved interfaces. From this we have again learned about planar interfaces since surfaces could be studied by techniques requiring large surface area (NMR, DSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/159235/Interfaces |title=Interfaces |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomolecular Systems===
The researchers in the Biomolecular Systems department, headed by Peter H. Seeberger, are using new methods for synthesizing sugar chains. Until recently most of the known naturally occurring sugars were those that supply energy to organisms such as [[sucrose]] (household sugar) and [[starch]] (in plants). However, the complex sugar molecules, which belong to the carbohydrate, are also involved in many biological processes. They cover all cells in the human body and play a crucial part in molecular identification of cell surfaces for example in infections, immune reactions and cancer metastases. Complex sugars are omnipresent as cell coatings in nature and can therefore also be used for vaccine development, e.g. against malaria. Carbohydrates are thus of significant interest for medicine; the major significance of sugar residues on the surfaces of cells for biology and medicine has only been recognized during the past approximately 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/145657/Colloid_Chemistry |title=Biomolecular systems |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently a chemical synthesis method to create biologically relevant carbohydrates with a known structure in large quantities and for biological, pharmaceutical and medical research was lacking. Now, these gaps can be closed with the development of the first automated synthesis apparatus that can link sugar molecules with other sugars or also molecules.

==Organization==
The Golm-based institute has a total of 358 employees, including 91 scientists and 99 junior scientists and researchers, 6 apprentices, 138 employees paid with third-party funds and 24 guest researchers. The Institute of Colloids and Interfaces is currently headed by the following people:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpikg.mpg.de/organization |title=Organization |author=Max Planck Institute, Munich |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Naumovich Epstein''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Нау́мович Эпште́йн}}; or Epshtein, born April 21, 1950) is a Russian-American literary theorist and critical thinker. Mikhail Epstein is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Cultural Theory and Russian Literature at Emory University, USA. He worked as Professor of Russian and Cultural Theory at Durham University, UK, in 2012–2015. He moved from the USSR (Moscow) to the USA (Atlanta) in 1990 and from the USA to England (Durham) in 2012 and then back to Atlanta, to resume teaching at Emory, in 2015. He was founder and director of Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University &lt;ref&gt;[Centre for Humanities Innovation at Durham University] [https://www.dur.ac.uk/chi/]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012–2015).

His areas of specialization include [[postmodernism]], cultural and literary theory; the history of [[Russian literature]]  (particularly Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Platonov and 20th century poetry) and intellectual history; contemporary philosophical and religious thought;  new methods and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities; semiotics, language evolution and neologisms; and ideas and electronic media. Professor Epstein is also an expert on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th century and on thinkers like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He writes essays on cultural, social, ethical and international issues.

==Biography==
Epstein was born in [[Moscow]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage. He graduated from the philological faculty of Moscow State University in 1972. He was a member of Soviet Writers Union since 1978 and the founder and director of the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture in Moscow (1988–89).

He moved to the USA in 1990 and was fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ([[Washington D.C.]]) in 1990–1991. He joined Emory faculty in 1990. In 1992–1994 he received grant from National Council for Soviet and East European Research to work on the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period. He has authored InteLnet (Intellectual network, 1995) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/intelnet2.html inteLnet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other interdisciplinary web sites in the humanities.

One of his major continuing  projects is "On the Future of the Humanities: Paradigmatic Shifts and Emerging Concepts" on which he worked as an inaugural senior fellow at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (Emory University, 2002–03)and as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University (2011). He had visiting professor appointments at Wesleyan University (1990) and University of Oregon at  Eugene (2002).

Mikhail Epstein has won national and international prizes, including Andrei Bely prize ([[St. Petersburg]], 1991); The Social Innovations Award 1995 from the Institute for Social Inventions (London) for his electronic Bank of New Ideas; the International Essay Contest set up by [[Lettre International]] and Weimar – Cultural City of Europe 1999; and Liberty Prize, awarded for his outstanding contribution in the development of Russian-American cultural connections (New York, 2000).

Epstein maintains blogs on "Facebook", "Snob" and "Live Journal" networks, where, in particular, since 2007 he conducts and reports "СЛОВО ГОДА" – a [[Word of the year (Russia)|Russian-language "Word of the Year"]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snob.ru/profile/27356/blog/101993 "СЛОВО ГОДА-2015. ИТОГИ ВЫБОРОВ" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Terms==

In the realm of [[aesthetics]], Epstein (together with poet and conceptual artist [[Dmitry Prigov]]) is credited with introducing the concept of "[[new sincerity]]" (''novaia iskrennost'') as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today," in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258-59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen," dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, "A Catalogue of New Poetries," in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exploration of contemporary spirituality, Epstein focuses on the concept of "post-atheism," or "minimal [or poor] religion," discussed in particular in his correspondence with the Protestant thinker Thomas Altizer and extensively examined in Charles Taylor's book "The Secular Age" (2007) that refers to Epstein's innovative work.

Mikhail Epstein has coined a number of new concepts and terms (in English and in Russian) that now circulate on tens of thousands of websites in various branches of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|title=The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|300px|This 2009 photo shows music production using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
'''Electronic and digital music technology''' is the use of electronic or digital instruments, [[computer]]s, electronic [[effects unit]]s, [[software]] or [[digital audio]] equipment by a [[musician]], [[composer]], [[sound engineer]], [[DJ]] or [[record producer]] to make, perform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=m:tech educational services|title=What is Music Technology?|url=http://www.mtechonline.co.uk/schools/what-is-music-technology.html|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sound recording|record]] [[music]]. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, electronic and digital instruments, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]] that is used in the [[performance]], playback, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[Music informatics|analysis]] and [[Digital audio editor|editing]] of music.

Music technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as [[digital audio workstation]]s and [[Protools]] digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the [[Music technology (electric)|electric music technologies]] of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the [[Ontology|ontological]] range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual.

==Education==

===Professional training===
{{see also|Audio engineer|Category:Audio engineering schools}}
Music technology is taught at many different educational levels, including college diplomas and university degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. The study of music technology is usually concerned with the creative use of technology for creating new sounds, performing, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[Programming (music)|programming]] [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] or other music-related electronic devices, and manipulating, mixing and reproducing music. Music technology programs train students for careers in "...sound engineering, computer music, audio-visual production and post-production, mastering, scoring for film and multimedia, audio for [[video games|games]], software development, and multimedia production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology|title=Music Technology - NYU Steinhardt|author=|date=|website=steinhardt.nyu.edu|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those wishing to develop new music technologies often train to become an [[Audio engineers#Research and development|audio engineer working in R&amp;D]].&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{cite web|last=wiseGeek|title=What Is Audio Engineering?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-audio-engineering.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increasing role of interdisciplinary work in music technology, individuals developing new music technologies may also have backgrounds or training in [[computer programming]], [[computer hardware]] design, [[acoustics]], [[record producer|record producing]] or other fields.

===Use in music education===
In the 2010s, electronic and digital music technologies are widely used to assist in [[music education]] for training students in high school, college and university music programs. [[Electronic keyboard]] labs are used for cost-effective beginner group piano instruction in colleges and universities.

==History==
Early pioneers included [[Luigi Russolo]], [[Halim El-Dabh]],&lt;ref name="holmes_156"&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic and experimental music: technology, music, and culture|first=Thom|last=Holmes|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2008|isbn=0-415-95781-8|chapter=Early Synthesizers and Experimenters|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Schaeffer]], [[Pierre Henry]], [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]],&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;[http://www.factmag.com/2017/04/02/ikutaro-kakehashi-life/ The life and times of Ikutaro Kakehashi, the Roland pioneer modern music owes everything to], ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[King Tubby]].&lt;ref name="veal"&gt;Michael Veal (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP54 ''Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae'', pages 26-44, "Electronic Music in Jamaica"], [[Wesleyan University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Music technology has been and is being used in many [[Modernism|modernist]] and contemporary experimental music situations to create new sound possibilities.

==Synthesizers and drum machines==
[[File:R.A.Moog minimoog 2.jpg|thumb|right|An early [[Minimoog]] synthesizer by R.A. Moog Inc. from 1970.]]
A [[synthesizer]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Synthesizers may either [[#Imitative synthesis|imitate existing sounds]] (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic [[timbres]] or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic [[musical keyboard]], but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including [[music sequencers]], [[MIDI controller|instrument controllers]], [[#Fingerboard controller|fingerboards]], [[guitar synthesizer]]s, [[wind controller]]s, and [[electronic drum]]s. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called [[sound modules]], and are controlled using a controller device.

Synthesizers use various methods to generate a signal. Among the most popular waveform synthesis techniques are [[subtractive synthesis]], [[additive synthesis]], [[wavetable synthesis]], [[frequency modulation synthesis]], [[phase distortion synthesis]], [[physical modeling synthesis]] and [[sample-based synthesis]]. Other less common synthesis types include [[Subharmonic synthesizer|subharmonic synthesis]], a form of additive synthesis via subharmonics (used by [[Trautonium|mixture trautonium]]), and [[granular synthesis]], sample-based synthesis based on grains of sound, generally resulting in [[soundscape]]s or [[Cloud (music)|clouds]]. In the 2010s, synthesizers are used in many genres of [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[dance music]]. Contemporary [[classical music]] [[composer]]s from the 20th and 21st century write compositions for synthesizer.

The development of the modern synthesizer was spurred on by the invention of the miniaturized [[transistor]] in 1947. The lightweight transistors made it was possible to make [[synthesizer]]s much more portable and complex. A new breed of synthesizers appeared, mainly in [[America]]. American inventor [[Robert Moog]]'s [[synthesizer]] designs in the 1960s were a significant advancement in the field over its predecessors. This was partially owed to new technologies that became available, such as the [[Semiconductors|newly developed semiconductors]]. These new instruments were less expensive and became available worldwide. These were capable of producing a vast range of complex sounds. Later versions often incorporated automatic rhythm units, called [[drum machine]]s. They had more popularity than any synthesizer from the past. The release of [[Wendy Carlos]]' album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'' in 1968 brought [[Moog synthesizer|Moog's synthesizer]] to the general public's attention. The album demonstrated that besides creating strange sounds, the [[synthesizer]] could be used to make beautiful music.

===Drum machines===
[[File:Yamaha RY30 front.png|thumb|A [[Yamaha]] RY30 Drum Machine]]
A [[drum machine]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] designed to imitate the [[sound]] of [[drum kit|drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s, other [[percussion instrument]]s, and often [[basslines]]. Drum machines either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. Drum machines are most commonly associated with [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]], but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when [[session musician|session drummers]] are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern drum machines are [[music sequencer|sequencers]] with a sample playback ([[rompler]]) or [[synthesizer]] component that specializes in the reproduction of drum [[timbre]]s. Though features vary from model to model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique [[drum beat]]s and patterns.

Electro-mechanical drum machines were first developed in 1949, with the invention of the [[Chamberlin|Chamberlin Rhythmate]]. Transistorized electronic drum machines later appeared in the 1960s. The [[Ace Tone]] Rhythm Ace, created by [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]], began appearing in [[popular music]] from the late 1960s, followed by drum machines from [[Korg]] and Ikutaro's later [[Roland Corporation]] also appearing in popular music from the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="sos_roland"&gt;{{citation |last=Reid |first=Gordon |year=2004 |title=The History Of Roland Part 1: 1930&amp;ndash;1978 |journal=[[Sound on Sound]] |issue=November |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov04/articles/roland.htm |accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s 1971 album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' helped to popularize the sound of early drum machines, along with [[Timmy Thomas]]' 1972 [[R&amp;B]] hit "[[Why Can't We Live Together]]" and [[George McCrae]]'s 1974 [[disco]] hit "[[Rock Your Baby]]" which used early Roland rhythm machines.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;Mike Collins (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdEABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320 ''In the Box Music Production: Advanced Tools and Techniques for Pro Tools'', page 320], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early drum machines sounded drastically different than the drum machines that gained their peak popularity in the 1980s and defined an entire decade of pop music. The most iconic drum machine was the [[Roland TR-808]], widely used in [[hip hop]] and [[dance music]]. Other classic drum machines include the [[Alesis|Alesis HR-16]], [[Korg Mini Pops|Korg Mini Pops 120]], [[E-mu|E-MU SP-12]], [[Elektron (company)|Elektron]] SPS1 Machinedrum, [[Roland CR-78]], [[PAiA Electronics|PAiA]] Programmable Drum Set, [[LinnDrum]], [[Roland TR-909]] and [[Oberheim DMX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=David|title=Top Ten Classic Drum Machines|url=http://www.attackmagazine.com/features/top-ten-classic-drum-machines/|website=Attack Magazine|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling technology==
{{see also|Sampler (musical instrument)|}}

Digital sampling technology, introduced in the 1980s, has become a staple of [[music production]] in the 2000s. Devices that use [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a [[piano]] or [[flute]] being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an [[electronic keyboard]], [[electronic drum]] pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various [[effects unit|audio effects]] and audio processing. Sampling has its roots in [[France]] with the sound experiments carried out by [[Musique Concrete]] practitioners.

In the 1980s, when the technology was still in its infancy, digital samplers cost tens of thousands of dollars and they were only used by the top [[recording studio]]s and musicians. These were out of the price range of most musicians. Early samplers include the 12-bit [[Toshiba]] [[Technodelic|LMD-649]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140-141]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8-bit [[Emulator I]] in 1981. The latter's successor, the [[Emulator II]] (released in 1984), listed for $8,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Kettlewell
 | first = Ben
 | author-link = 
 | title = Electronic Music Pioneers
 | publisher = Pro Music Press
 | location = USA
 | date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samplers were released during this period with high price tags, such as the [[Kurzweil Music Systems|K2000]] and [[K2500]].

The first affordable sampler, the [[Akai|AKAI S612]], became available in the mid-1980s and retailed for US$895. Other companies soon released affordable samplers, including the [[Ensoniq Mirage|Mirage Sampler]], [[Oberheim Electronics|Oberheim DPX-1]], and more by [[Korg]], [[Casio]], [[Yamaha]], and [[Roland]]. Some important hardware samplers include the [[Akai|Akai Z4/Z8]], [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland V-Synth]], [[Casio FZ-1]], [[Kurzweil K250]], [[Akai MPC60]], [[Ensoniq Mirage]], [[Akai S1000]], [[E-mu Emulator]], and [[Fairlight CMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solida|first1=Scot|title=The 10 most important hardware samplers in history|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-10-most-important-hardware-samplers-in-history-361471|website=Music Radar|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest uses of sampling technology was by [[hip-hop music]] [[DJ]]s and performers in the 1980s. Before affordable sampling technology was readily available, DJs
would use a technique pioneered by [[Grandmaster Flash]] to manually repeat certain parts in a song by juggling between two separate turntables. This can be considered as an early precursor of sampling. In turn, this [[turntablism]] technique originates from Jamaican [[dub music]] in the 1960s, and was introduced to American hip hop in the 1970s.

In the 2000s, most professional recording studios use digital technologies. In the 2010s, many samplers exist in the digital-only realm. This new generation of digital samplers are capable of reproducing and manipulating sounds. New genres of music have formed which would be impossible without sampling. Advanced sample libraries have made complete performances of [[orchestra]]l compositions possible that sound similar to a live performance.&lt;ref name="Musical Instruments" /&gt; Modern sound libraries allow musicians to have the ability to use the sounds of almost any instrument in their productions.

==MIDI==
{{see also|MIDI|}}
[[File:Synth rack @ Choking Sun Studio.jpg|thumb|alt=Several rack-mounted synthesizers that share a single controller|MIDI allows multiple instruments to be played from a single controller (often a keyboard, as pictured here), which makes stage setups much more portable. This system fits into a single rack case, but prior to the advent of MIDI. it would have required four separate, heavy full-size keyboard instruments, plus outboard mixing and [[effects unit]]s.]]
[[MIDI]] has been the musical instrument industry standard interface since the 1980s through to the present day.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; It dates back to June 1981, when [[Roland Corporation]] founder [[Ikutaro Kakehashi]] proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers' instruments as well as computers, to [[Oberheim Electronics]] founder [[Tom Oberheim]] and [[Sequential Circuits]] president [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]]. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from [[Yamaha]], [[Korg]] and [[Kawai (company)|Kawai]].&lt;ref name="chadab5100"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadabe|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Chadabe|date=1 May 2000|title=Part IV: The Seeds of the Future|journal=Electronic Musician|publisher=Penton Media|volume=XVI|issue=5|url=http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928230435/http://www.emusician.com/gear/0769/the-electronic-century-part-iv-the-seeds-of-the-future/145415|archivedate=28 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/technical-grammy-award-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith|title=Technical GRAMMY Award: Ikutaro Kakehashi And Dave Smith|date=29 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/videos/technical-grammy-award-recipients-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-dave-smith-at-special-merit-awards|title=Ikutaro Kakehashi, Dave Smith: Technical GRAMMY Award Acceptance|date=9 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[NAMM]] show in [[Los Angeles]] of 1983, [[MIDI]] was released. A demonstration at the convention showed two previously incompatible analog [[synthesizer]]s, the [[Sequential Circuits|Prophet 600]] and [[Roland Jupiter-6]], communicating with each other, enabling a player to play one keyboard while getting the output from both of them. This was a massive breakthrough in the 1980s, as it allowed synths to be accurately layered in live shows and studio recordings. MIDI enables different electronic instruments and electronic music devices to communicate with each other and with computers. The advent of MIDI spurred a rapid expansion of the sales and production of electronic instruments and music software.

In 1985, several of the top keyboard manufacturers created the [[MIDI Manufacturers Association|MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA)]]. This newly founded association standardized the MIDI protocol by generating and disseminating all the documents about it. With the development of the MIDI File Format Specification by [[Opcode]], every music software company's [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencer software]] could read and write each other's files.

Since the 1980s, [[personal computers]] developed and became the ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of [[MIDI]]. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped [[electronic keyboard]]s, [[Music sequencer|MIDI sequencers]] and [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, sequencers, and drum machines can all be connected together.

Some universally accepted varieties of [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI software applications]] include music instruction software, MIDI sequencing software, music notation software, [[hard disk]] recording/editing software, patch editor/sound library software, computer-assisted composition software, and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]]. Current developments in computer hardware and specialized software continue to expand MIDI applications.

==Computers in music technology==

Computer and synthesizer technology joining together changed the way music is made, and is one of the fastest changing aspects of music technology today. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Max Matthews]], a telecommunications engineer at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]' Acoustic and Behavioural Research Department, is responsible for some of the first digital music technology in the 50s. [[Max Mathews|Dr. Matthews]] also pioneered a cornerstone of music technology; [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog to digital conversion]].

The first generation of professional commercially available computer music instruments, or [[workstation]]s as some companies later called them, were very sophisticated elaborate systems that cost a great deal of money when they first appeared. They ranged from $25,000 to $200,000.&lt;ref name="Electronic Music Pioneers" /&gt; The two most popular were the [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]], and the [[Synclavier]].

It was not until the advent of [[MIDI]] that [[general-purpose computer]]s started to play a role in music production. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based [[Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers|MIDI editors and sequencers]] were developed. MIDI-to-[[CV/Gate]] converters were then used to enable [[analogue synthesizer]]s to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.&lt;ref name="russ2012"&gt;{{cite book	 | last      = Russ         |first      = Martin	 | year      = 2012	 | title     = Sound Synthesis and Sampling	 | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=X9h5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192	 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]	 | ISBN     = 1136122141	 | page      = 192	 | accessdate = 26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduced prices in [[personal computer]]s caused the masses to turn away from the more expensive [[workstation]]s. Advancements in technology have increased the speed of hardware processing and the capacity of memory units. Software developers write new, more powerful programs for sequencing, recording, notating, and mastering music.

==2000s==
[[Music sequencer]] software, such as [[Pro Tools]], [[Logic Audio]] and many others, are  the most widely used form of contemporary music technology in the 2000s. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a [[microphone]], [[audio mixing|mix tracks]] record or [[MIDI]] musical sequences, which may then be organized along a timeline and edited on a [[flat-panel display]] of a [[computer]] or [[Digital Audio Workstation]]. Musical segments recorded on can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or added noise (a major contrast from [[analog recording]], in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and added noise). Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. [[Contemporary classical music]] sometimes uses computer-generated sounds, either pre-recorded or generated/manipulated live, in conjunction or [[wikt:juxtaposition]] with classical [[Acoustic music|acoustic instruments]] like the cello or violin. Classical and other notated types of music are frequently written on [[scorewriter]] software.

Many musicians and artists use 'patcher' type programmes, such as [[Pure Data|Pd]], [[Bidule]], [[Max/MSP]], [[Kyma (sound design language)]] and [[Audiomulch]] as well as (or instead of) [[digital audio workstation]]s or sequencers and there are still a significant number of people using more "traditional" software only approaches such as [[CSound]] or the [[Composers Desktop Project]]. Music technology includes many forms of music reproduction. Music and sound technology refer to the use of sound engineering in a commercial, experimental or amateur hobbyist manner. Music technology and sound technology may sometimes be classed as the same thing, but they actually refer to different fields of work. Sound engineering refers primarily to the use of sound technology for [[sound recording]] or in [[sound reinforcement system]]s used in concerts and live shows.

{{coord|24|25|S|66|10|W|display=intitle|notes={{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1129}}}}
'''Nevado de Acay''' is a {{convert|5950|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain in [[Argentina]]. It is a [[Intrusive rock|volcanic intrusion]] that formed during the [[Miocene]] and was later exposed. The intrusion is formed by [[monzonite]] and is associated with a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that also connects to neighbouring volcanoes.

While not presently [[Glacier|glaciated]], it contains a seasonal [[snowpack]] and is the source of several streams and rivers, including the [[Salado River (Argentina)|Rio Salado]]. A number of archeological sites have been found on Nevado de Acay and mining activity occurred there until recent times.

== Geology ==

Nevado de Acay is {{convert|5716|m}},&lt;ref name="MartiniStrelin2013" /&gt; {{convert|5886|m}}{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1129}} or {{convert|5950|m}} high.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=17}}{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1129}} It lies in the [[La Poma Department]] of [[Argentina]]'s [[Salta Province]]. It is part of the Cuesta del Acay mountains and their highest summit.{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=8}} The Calchaqui valley extends south from Nevado de Acay.{{sfn|Paoli|2003|p=10}}

It is formed by [[monzonite]] that was generated 12.6 ± 0.3 million years ago,&lt;ref name="InselGrove2012" /&gt; along the Calchaqui fault.{{sfn|del Papa|Petrinovic|2017|p=197}} It originally formed as an [[intrusion]] that was exposed about 12.61 ± 0.25 million years ago.{{sfn|del Papa|Petrinovic|2017|p=199}} Another date is 26 million years ago,{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=686}} which would make it contemporaneous with the disintegration of the [[Farallon Plate]] and the following increase in [[subduction]] and volcanic activity.{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=710}} Yet another older date is 18.9 million years ago.&lt;ref name="PetrinovicRiller2005" /&gt;

Emplaced within the [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] Puncoviscana [[formation (geology)|formation]], the Nevado de Acay monzonite contains [[biotite]], [[diorite]], [[hornblende]], [[magnetite]], [[monzodiorite]], [[pyroxene]], [[titanite]] and [[tonalite]]. [[Skarn]] and mineral deposits formed within the monzonite as well.{{sfn|Coira|Kay|Viramonte|1993|p=686}}

Located close to the [[Negra Muerta volcanic complex]], it is a volcanic system associated with the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro [[fault (geology)|fault]] system. Other volcanoes such as [[Aguas Calientes caldera|Aguas Calientes]] and [[Incahuasi Sur]] are associated with this fault system.&lt;ref name="PetrinovicRiller2005" /&gt;

[[Cirque]]s indicate the presence of former glaciers.&lt;ref name="Martonne1934" /&gt; The present-day [[snowline]] lies at an altitude of {{convert|5800|m}};{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1128}} [[rock glacier]]s fed by avalanches exist on Nevado de Acay in [[Pleistocene]] glacier valleys.{{sfn|U.S. Geological Survey|1984|p=1139}} Nevado de Acay is covered in snow only during the winter months, although summer storms can also deposit snow on it; during the dry season the mountain is bare.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=17}}

The {{Interlanguage link multi|Calchaqui River|es|3=Río Calchaquí}} originates on Nevado de Acay and flows south,{{sfn|Paoli|2003|p=39}}{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=84}} as does the [[Rio Juramento]].{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=278}} Other waterbodies originating on Nevado de Acay are the Arroyo Pircas, a tributary to the Rio Juramento,{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=386}} Arroyo Tastil which flows into Arroyo del Toro,{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=483}} which also originates on Nevado de Acay and eventually flows into the Arroyo Arias;{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=491}} Arroyo Arias in turn also drains into the Juramento.{{sfn|Marrazzo|1921|p=39}} Most streams in the area are fed with [[meltwater]]. The mountains form the [[drainage divide]]; water flowing to the west eventually ends up in various [[endorheic]] basins.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=17}} The [[Rio Los Patos]] also originates on Nevado de Acay and archeological sites are found on its river terraces,{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=375}} and it converges with the [[Rio San Antonio de los Cobres]], which likewise originates on Nevado de Acay as [[Rio Organullo]] and after passing close to [[San Antonio del los Cobres]] and receiving the Quebrada Potrerillos carries the name of the town, and eventually reach [[Salinas Grandes (Jujuy and Salta)|Salinas Grandes]] where they evaporate.{{sfn|Paoli|2003|p=102}}

== Biology ==

''[[Liolaemus multicolor]]'', an [[iguanid]] [[lizard]], has been found on Nevado de Acay.&lt;ref name="Troncoso-Palacios2014" /&gt; [[Endorheic]] basins in the valleys on Nevado de Acay were an important resource for the Las Cuevas V [[archeological site]], which belongs to a cultural horizont between 600 [[Anno Domini|BC]] - 400 [[AD]].&lt;ref name="Feo2011" /&gt;

== Human activities ==
[[File:Mines on Nevado de Acay.jpg|thumb|Map of mines in a 1907 sketch]]
Nevado de Acay is the site of an [[Inca civilization|Inka]] mountain sanctuary.{{sfn|Morello|Matteucci|Rodriguez|Silva|2012|p=19}} A summit sanctuary was discovered in 2000; later two additional sites were discovered on the subsidiary summits Blanca and Navaja.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=377}} Some historical references to the mountain indicate that it was the connection between the Inka province Chicoana and the [[Altiplano|Puna]], although the [[Abra del Acay]] is not the only place to which these historical records may refer. The present day [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]] passes close to the mountain.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt;

The mountaintop was not the sole site of human activity at Nevado de Acay; traces of mining and pastoral activity among others has been found lower on its slopes as well. At least 53 structures have been identified at elevations between {{convert|4500|-|5000|m}}.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt; Historical records exist of a site named "San Bernardo de Acay" south of Nevado de Acay.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=376}} The archeological structures of Nevado de Acay are still only incompletely understood.{{sfn|Mignone|2015|p=385}}

Some of these mines reported in 1907 are known as "Flor de Desierto", "Protectora", "Resurreccion" and "Saturno" - the last owner of these mines obtained them in 1924. Mining activity including [[gold]] and [[silver]] is reported to have occurred in the area during the time of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] rule and ended only during the 1656 rebellion of [[Pedro Bohórquez]]; the Spanish efforts on these mines may have been the reason why the rebellion occurred in the region. Later an [[iron]] mine was active on the northern slope but it is now abandoned.&lt;ref name="Mignone2014" /&gt; [[Obsidian]] outcrops have been observed in the area.&lt;ref name="YacobaccioEscola2004" /&gt;

C. Grayling]], who became its first [[Master (college)|Master]].&lt;ref name=BoothJune82011/&gt;

In November 2018, Northeastern University, a private research university in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], USA, announced its intention to acquire the New College of the Humanities. The deal is pending regulatory approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Redden |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/14/northeastern-plans-acquire-humanities-college-london |title=Northeastern to Acquire London College |work=Inside Higher Ed |date=2018-11-14 |accessdate=2018-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards &amp; results ==

=== Awards ===
In 2016 two University of London academic awards were given to NCH London students,  including the [[Sir Charles Harris award]].

In 2015 New College of the Humanities won the Courses and Lecturers category at the What Uni Student Choice Awards (WUSCA) and came fourth in the category of University of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatuni.com/degrees/student-awards-winners/2015.html|title=WUSCA Courses and Lecturers|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatuni.com/degrees/student-awards-winners/2015.html|title=University of the Year|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 NCH students won three of the University of London's academic awards, including the Sir Charles Harris award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://view.joomag.com/university-of-london-international-programmes-graduation-2015-graduation-2015/0540571001479387047?page=75|title=Academic Awards|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Results ===
In the 2017 National Student Survey, NCH achieved student satisfaction scores above Russell Group universities and London universities, beating London members of the Russell Group in most categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/2017/08/09/nch-leads-london-institutions-nss-2017/|title=NCH London leads London universities|last=|first=|date=4 December 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 it was reported that independent research that replicated the annual HEPI academic experience survey showed that the College's academic experience had exceeded the expectations of 63% of its students. This was more than twice the comparative statistic (28%) for [[Russell Group]] university students of humanities and social sciences in the HEPI 2014 annual student experience survey. The same research also showed that NCH students experienced 40% more contact time than their peers at Russell Group universities, that they completed twice as many assignments, and that they received feedback on their assignments in person more than twice as often.

== Degrees &amp; teaching ==

===Courses===
The college offers tuition for 53 undergraduate programmes featuring major and minor options in Art History, Creative Writing, Economics, English, History, Law, Philosophy and Politics and International Relations, as well as a single honours Law LLB, and a Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA. In addition, its undergraduate students complete courses in applied ethics, critical reasoning, science literacy, and a professional development programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/hubs/undergraduate/&lt;/ref&gt; The science literacy course includes as its teachers, Richard Dawkins teaching evolution,  Steven Pinker lecturing about the brain, and Daniel C Dennett lecturing on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/science-literacy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

In 2016 NCH announced that it would be offering its first postgraduate qualification, the Historical Research and Public History MA starting in September 2016. This Masters programme has been designed by Dr [[Suzannah Lipscomb]], Head of Faculty and Senior Lecturer in Early Modern History.

The College's foundation attracted a substantial response in the UK, and a significant amount of adverse publicity, where most higher education institutions are publicly funded. London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], welcomed it as a bold experiment, while ''The Times'' argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Boris.

* "Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an angry reaction from sections of the academic community. Complaints included that NCH had copied the course descriptions of the University of London's international programmes on its website; was offering the same syllabus with a significantly higher price tag; and that the senior academics involved with the project would in fact do very little of the teaching.&lt;ref name=BakerJune92011&gt;Baker, Simon.

[[File:Bedford Square 2.jpg|thumb|The Registry, Bedford Square]]

The college has a building called ''The Registry'' in [[Bedford Square]] where the one-to-one and small group tutorials take place. The Registry also contains rooms for most lectures. In addition, the college's students have access to the University's facilities, including Senate House Library &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/living-in-london/libraries/&lt;/ref&gt; and Student Central.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/living-in-london/the-campus/#page-section-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/08/university-london-independent-college-humanities "University of London's independent stance"], letter from the dean of University of London International Programmes, ''The Guardian'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It block-books rooms for its first-year students with student accommodation providers in Bloomsbury, Westminster, St Pancras and Tufnell Park.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/accommodation/&lt;/ref&gt; NCH has offered classes since October 2012,&lt;ref name="BBCJune52011" /&gt; its annual fees are £9,250.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nchlondon.ac.uk/funding/home-fees/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Grayling said he had received 900 expressions of interest from potential students and 80 job applications in the first week.&lt;ref name=GrimstonJune122011/&gt; Britain's former prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], endorsed it;&lt;ref name=LongJune122011&gt;Long, Camilla. "AC Grayling: Is it safe to come out now?", ''The Sunday Times'', 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], called it the boldest experiment in higher education in the UK since the foundation in 1983 of the [[University of Buckingham]], the UK's first private university; he wrote that it showed the way ahead for academics demoralized by government interference with admissions procedures and "scapegoated for the weaknesses of the schools."&lt;ref name=JohnsonJune62011/&gt; ''The Times'' argued that higher education has been a closed shop in the UK for too long, that all over the world there are excellent universities run independently of the state, and that in its conception NCH is teaching by example.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiments in Teaching," ''The Times'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' wrote that there is a market for the idea because of the increasing number of qualified British students who fail to get into their university of choice, in part because of pressure on the top universities from the [[Office for Fair Access]] to increase the number of students from state schools; they added that "a 'toffs’ college' of well-heeled Oxbridge near-misses is a provocative concept."&lt;ref name=EconomistJune92011&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18805758 "One very New College, at a price"], ''The Economist'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, one of the college's partners, said he had read the criticism of NCH with incredulity: "Anyone who cares about the humanities will be cheering Anthony Grayling."&lt;ref name=GrimstonJune122011/&gt;

The news triggered accusations of elitism. Literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] called the college "odious," arguing that it was taking advantage of a crumbling university system to make money;&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/06/ac-graylings-new-private-univerity-is-odious "AC Grayling's new private University is odious"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Grayling responded that Eagleton himself teaches a few weeks a year at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in Indiana, USA, a private - though non-profit - university.&lt;ref name=MalikJune92011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616035525/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/eagleton/ Terry Eagleton], Excellence in English Distinguished Visitor, [[University of Notre Dame]], June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyer [[David Allen Green]], writing in the ''New Statesman'', described NCH as a "sham" and a "branding exercise with purchased celebrity endorsements and a PR-driven website."&lt;ref name="GreenJune72011"&gt;Green, David Allen. [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/06/college-humanities-students "Grayling's Folly is falling down"], ''New Statesman'', 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Several academics complained in a letter to ''The Guardian'' that its creation was a setback for the campaign against the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|current government's]] policy of commercializing education, and were joined by 34 of Grayling's former colleagues at Birkbeck, who questioned how much teaching the college's 14 academic partners would actually do.&lt;ref&gt;For the letter, see [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/07/new-college-humanities-gated-intellectual-community "The shame of this 'gated intellectual community'"], Letters to the editor, ''The Guardian'', 7 June 2011.

[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3054167.ece "Don't call these people Ivy League pioneers"], ''The Times'', 7 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Young]] argued in ''The Daily Telegraph'' that the reaction was part of a left-wing campaign to retain state control over education, involving, he wrote, public sector unions, university lecturers, and the Socialist Workers Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100091198/welcome-to-the-fight-professor-grayling/ "Welcome to the fight, Professor Grayling"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Jenkins]] wrote that the country's professors, lecturers and student trade unionists were "united in arms against what they most hate and fear: academic celebrity, student fees, profit and loss, one-to-one tutorials and America."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Simon. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/ac-grayling-caricatured-british-university-fuming "AC Grayling has caricatured British universities. No wonder they're fuming"], ''The Guardian'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grayling responded to the criticism by arguing that NCH is trying to keep humanities teaching alive. He said he felt persecuted by the negative reaction: "My whole record, everything I have written, is turned on its head. Now I am a bastard capitalist. It is really upsetting. ... Education is a public good and we should be spending more on it and it shouldn't be necessary to do this, but standing on the sidelines moaning and wailing is not an option."&lt;ref name="VasagarBoothJune72011"&gt;Vasagar, Jeevan and Booth, Robert.

You want your surgeon or airline pilot to have been trained at an elite institution."&lt;ref name="NewHumanist"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2859/saving-our-universities-new-humanist-interviews-ac-grayling|title=Saving our universities?

A dozen protesters heckled Grayling at [[Foyles]] bookshop in London on 7 June 2011 during a debate about cuts to arts funding, one of them shouting that he had "no right to speak." A protester let off a smoke bomb, and 100 people were evacuated from the store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8562531/AC-Grayling-forced-to-flee-smoke-bomb-protest-at-Foyles-debate-on-private-university.html "AC Grayling forced to flee smoke bomb protest at Foyles debate on private university"],  Andrew Hough, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the week police removed protesters from a [[British Humanist Association]] talk by Richard Dawkins at the [[Institute of Education]].&lt;ref name=GrimstonJune122011/&gt;

In January 2012, the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office|UK's Intellectual Property Office]] objected to the college name being registered as a trademark because of possible confusion with [[New College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name ="BBC 2012 01 23"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16681870 Private college faces objection in trade mark bid], BBC News, 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station''' (or NJAES) is an entity currently operated by [[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]] in conjunction with the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]] in the university's role as the state's sole [[land-grant university]]. Today, it conducts research in agriculture, horticulture and turf grass science, and through the [[Rutgers Cooperative Extension]] aids New Jersey farmers, landscapers, and residents in each of the state's twenty-one counties.

==History==
In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College as their sole [[Land-grant university|land grant college]]. Pursuant to the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]], this designation gave federal lands to the state that the state could then sell to raise money to develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory"&gt;McCormick, Richard P. ''Rutgers: A Bicentennial History''. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref&gt;The Morrill Act of 1862 (P.L. 1862 ch. 130; 12 Stat. 504) was codified as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/304 United States Code, Title 7, Chapter 13,  Subchapter I, § 304 — "Investment of proceeds of sale of land or scrip"]. Retrieved 25 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hammell Cook]] (1818-1889), a professor of chemistry and natural sciences, influenced the state to select Rutgers over the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). Cook was appointed state geologist in 1864 and later became the college's vice president. With the college's land grant status and new funding for scientific studies, Cook expanded his research and teaching into geology and agriculture.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory" /&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref name="CampbellMemorial1894"&gt;David Murray (compiler).

(Trenton, New Jersey: State Gazette Publishing Company, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

The Agricultural Experiment Station began with agriculture instruction in the college's [[Geology Hall]], built in 1872, until [[New Jersey Hall]] was built in 1889. The New Jersey state legislature provided funds to construct an "Agricultural Hall" to house the station, and Rutgers built the Richard Romanesque style building in 1889. The university operated the station from that facility and through its college farm located on what became the college's [[Cook College|Cook Campus]] where it remains today at 102 Ryders Lane in [[North Brunswick, New Jersey]].

Through the station's Office of Continuing Professional Education (OCPE), the NJAES provides [[continuing education]] programmes to residents and professionals throughout the state of New Jersey. OCPE offers courses in topic areas like Wetlands preservation, Professional Golf Course Turf Management, Food Science, Food Safety, Public Health and Safety, Landscape construction and architecture, environmental sciences, and recycling. The station aims to increase coursework and research in planned agricultural production and competitiveness; food science and engineering; nutrition, health and safety; marine and coastal resources; natural resources and the environment; and human and community resource development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookce.rutgers.edu/main/mission.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actions to convey and/or [[censorship|deny selected information]] and indicators to foreign audiences to [[psychological manipulation|influence]] their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning as well as to [[Military intelligence|intelligence systems]] and leaders at all levels to influence official estimates, ultimately resulting in foreign behaviors and official actions favorable to the originator's objectives. In various ways, perception management combines [[propaganda|truth projection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/532/media-manipulation|title=Media Manipulation|author=Anup Shah|date=April 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[operations security]], cover and [[Military deception|deception]], and [[psychological warfare|psychological operations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108082044/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |date=2009-11-08 }}, Joint Publication 1-02, 12 April 2001 (As Amended Through 17 December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Perception" is defined as the "process by which individuals select, organize, and interpret the input from their senses to give meaning and order to the world around them".&lt;ref name="George"&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=Jennifer|title=Chapter 4: Perception, Attribution, and the Management of Diversity|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/1598/1636589/GJ4_PPT04S.ppt|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition overlaps with the higher-order [[perception|perceptual]] processes as defined biologically (the lower-order biological processes are in no way susceptible to management; these low-level processes include a great deal of underlying perceptual categorization performed ''prior'' to conscious categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman Barrett |first=Lisa |date=2016 |title=How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719305-how-emotions-are-made |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |page=&lt;!-- pervasive theme --&gt; |isbn=0544133315 |access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Components of perception include the perceiver, target of perception, and the situation. 
Factors that influence the perceiver:
* [[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]: organization and interpretation of information based on past experiences and knowledge
* Motivational state: needs, values, and desires of a perceiver at the time of perception
* [[Mood (psychology)|Mood]]: emotions of the perceiver at the time of perception
Factors that influence the target:
* [[Ambiguity]]: a lack of clarity. If ambiguity increases, the perceiver may find it harder to form an accurate perception
* [[Social status]]: a person's real or perceived position in society or in an organization
* [[Impression management]]: an attempt to control the perceptions or impressions of others. Targets are likely to use impression management tactics when interacting with perceivers who have power over them. Several impression management tactics include behavioral matching between the target of perception and the perceiver, self-promotion (presenting one's self in a positive light), conforming to situational norms, appreciating others, or being consistent.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt;

==History==
The phrase "perception management" has often functioned as a [[euphemism]] for "an aspect of [[information warfare]]." A scholar in the field notes a distinction between "perception management" and [[public diplomacy]], which "does not, as a rule, involve [[Lie|falsehood]] and [[deception]], whereas these are important ingredients of perception management; the purpose is to get the other side to believe what one wishes it to believe, ''whatever'' the truth may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Emily O. |last=Goldman |title=National Security in the Information Age: Issues, Interpretations, Periodizations |publisher=Routledge (U.K.) |isbn=0-7146-5600-3 |year=2004}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0714656003&amp;id=eVjyM-hSycIC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;sig=Ap7zytDSJZBEpQpJMGDbKJs94bY p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase "perception management" is filtering into common use as a synonym for "[[persuasion]]." [[Public relations]] firms now offer "perception management" as one of their services. Similarly, public officials who are being accused of shading the truth are now frequently charged with engaging in "perception management" when disseminating information to media or to the general public.

Although perception management operations are typically carried out within the international arena between governments, and between governments and citizens, use of perception management techniques have become part of mainstream information management systems in many ways that do not concern military campaigns or government relations with citizenry. Businesses may even contract with other businesses to conduct perception management for them, or they may conduct it in-house with their public relations staff.

As Stan Moore has written, "Just because truth has been omitted, does not mean that truth is not true. Just because reality has not been perceived, does not mean that it is not real."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Strategies==
There are nine strategies for perception management. According to Kegon Thomas, these include:
# Preparation – Having clear goals and knowing the ideal position you want people to hold.
# [[Credibility]] – Make sure all of your information is consistent, often using prejudices or expectations to increase credibility.
# [[Multichannel marketing|Multichannel]] support – Have multiple arguments and fabricated facts to reinforce your information.
# Centralized control – Employing entities such as propaganda ministries or bureaus.
# Security – The nature of the deception campaign is known by few.
# Flexibility – The deception campaign adapts and changes over time as needs change.
# Coordination – The organization or propaganda ministry is organized in a hierarchical pattern in order to maintain consistent and synchronized distribution of information.
# [[Cover-up|Concealment]] – Contradicting information is destroyed.
# Untruthful statements – Fabricate the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/Deception-IWC6-05-Slides.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612060533/http://ausairpower.net/Deception-IWC6-05-Slides.pdf |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |title=Classical Deception Techniques and Perception Management vs. the Four Strategies of Information Warfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational==
Organizations use perception management in daily internal and external interactions as well as prior to major product/strategy introductions and following events of crisis. Life cycle models of [[organizational development]] suggest that the growth and ultimate survival of a firm is dependent on how effectively business leaders navigate crisis, or crisis-like, events through their life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hargis, Michael|author2=John D. Watt|title= Organizational Perception Management: A Framework to Overcome Crisis Events|journal=Organization Development Journal|volume=28|issue=1|year=2010|pp=73–87|publisher=Business Source Complete|via=EBSCO|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/48056249/organizational-perception-management-framework-overcome-crisis-events}}&lt;/ref&gt; As suggested by studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

Cook (Eds.), Trust and distrust in organizations: Dilemmas and approaches (pp. 275-292) |publisher=The Russel Sage Foundation (New York) |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizational perception management involves actions that are designed and carried out by organizational spokespersons to influence audiences' perceptions of the organization. This definition is based on the understanding of four unique components of organizational perception management: perception of the organization; actions or tactics; organizational spokespersons; and organizational audiences. The organizational perceptions is further classified into three major forms namely '''organizational images''', '''organizational reputation''', and '''organizational identities'''.&lt;ref name="Elsbach"&gt;{{cite book |first=K. D. |last=Elsbach |title=Organizational perception management |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associate, Publishers (Mahwah, New Jersey) |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perception Management Events:''' Perception management is often used by an organization in the following major events:

#''Dealing with perception-threatening events:'' Include such events as scandals, accidents, product failures, controversial identity changes, upcoming performance reviews, and introduction of new identity or vision.
# ''Dealing with perception-enhancing events:'' Include such events as positive/negative ranking or rating by industry groups, overcoming hardships, and achievement of desired goals.&lt;ref name=Elsbach/&gt;

Following are the examples of perception management in relation to specific organizations or communities:

==US government==
Beginning in the 1950s, news media and public information organizations and individuals carried out assignments to manage the public's perception of the [[CIA]], according to the ''[[New York Times]]''. [[Carl Bernstein]] wrote in 1977 that "The CIA in the 1950's, '60's, and even early 70's had concentrated its relationships with [[journalist]]s in the most prominent sectors of the American press corps, including four or five of the largest newspaper in the country, the broadcast networks, and the two major weekly news magazines." [[David Atlee Phillips]], a former CIA station chief in Mexico City, described the method of recruitment years later to Bernstein: "Somebody from the Agency says, 'I want you to sign a piece of paper before I tell you what it's about.' I didn't hesitate to sign, and a lot of newsmen didn't hesitate over the next twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bernstein, "The CIA and the Media," ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 1977; cited in Lamar Waldron, ''[[Legacy of Secrecy]]'' (Berkeley: Counterpoint Press, 2008) pp. 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "perception management" is not new to the lexicon of government language. For years the [[FBI]] has listed foreign perception management as one of eight "key issue threats" to [[national security]], including it with [[terrorism]], attacks on critical US infrastructure, and [[weapon]]s [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] among others. The FBI clearly recognizes perception management as a threat when it is directed at the US by foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;Martemucci, Matteo G. "Regaining the High Ground: The Challenges of Perception Management in National Strategy and Military Operations". 17 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Department of Defense ===
[[Military deception|Deception]] and [[sleight of hand]] are important in gaining advantages in war, both to gain domestic support of the operations and for the military against the enemy. Although perception management is specifically defined as being limited to foreign audiences, critics of the [[US Department of Defense|DOD]] charge that it also engages in domestic perception management. An example cited is the prohibition of viewing or photographing the flag draped caskets of dead military as they are unloaded in bulk upon arrival in the U.S. for further distribution, a policy only recently implemented. The DOD also describes perception management as an intent to provoke the behavior one wants out of a given individual.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} During the [[Cold War]], [[The Pentagon]] sent undercover US journalists to Russia and Eastern Europe to write pro-American articles for local media outlets. A similar situation occurred in Iraq in 2005 when the US military covertly paid Iraqi newspapers to print stories written by US soldiers; these stories were geared towards enhancing the appearance of the US mission in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daragahi, Borzou|author2=Mark Mazzetti|title=U.S. Military Covertly Pays to Run Stories in Iraqi Press|work=Los Angeles Times|date= 30 November 2005|p=A1|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/30/world/fg-infowar30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, during the Vietnam War, critics allege the Pentagon exaggerated [[Red Scare|communist threat]]s to the United States in order to gain more public support for an increasingly bloody war. This was similarly seen in 2003 with accusations that the government embellished the threat and existence of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Shanker, Thom|author2=Schmitt, Eric|title=Pentagon Weighs Use of Deception in a Broad Arena|date=13 December 2004|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/13/politics/pentagon-weighs-use-of-deception-in-a-broad-arena.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US military has demonstrated using perception management multiple times in modern warfare, even though it has proven to take a hit to its credibility among the American people. In late 2001 after [[9/11]], Defense Secretary [[Donald H. Rumsfeld]] created the Pentagon's [[Office of Strategic Influence]] (OSI). When it came to light, [[the Pentagon]] was initially criticized for simply using a perception management office to influence foreign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schmitt, Eric|date=Dec 5, 2003|title=Pentagon &amp; Bogus News: All is Denied|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/05/world/pentagon-and-bogus-news-all-is-denied.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OSI was dismantled less than five months after its creation when sources alleged to the press that one of its goals was domestic influence, similar to the [[Iran-Contra]] era [[Office of Public Diplomacy]].  Shortly after, the [[Office of Special Plans]] was created with a more focused goal of selective intelligence vetting outside the normal chartered intelligence apparatus, with foreign propaganda activities moved to the [[Information Awareness Office|Office of Information Activities]] under the direction of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense]] for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glough, Susan L LTC|date=April 7, 2003|title=The Evolution of Strategic Influence|publisher=US Army War College|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, strategic influence, special plans, [[psychological operations]], and perception management are all direct synonyms within the DoD.&lt;ref&gt;Good (1997), 481-482&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the DOD has continued to pursue actively a course of perception management about the [[Iraq War]]. "The Department of Defense is conscious that there is an increasingly widespread public perception that the U.S. military is becoming brutalized by the campaign in Iraq. Recognizing its vulnerability to information and media flows, the DoD has identified the information domain as its new 'asymmetric flank.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Oxford Analytica]]|title=Perception Management|publisher=Forbes|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=20 Nov 2008|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/07/04/haditha-iraq-tribunal-cx_0705oxford.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of use of perception management is continuing to grow throughout the Army. Until recently specialists, known as [[Psychological Operations (United States)|psychological operations officer]]s and [[Civil affairs|civil affairs officer]]s, whose only purpose is to decide how to present information to the media and to the people of the current country that they are in only held positions in high division levels of command. The Army has decided that it is now necessary that these specialists be included in the transformed brigades and deal with "everything from analyzing the enemy's propaganda leaflets to talking with natives to see what the Army can do to make them their friends", said 3rd Brigade's Civil Affairs Officer Maj. Glenn Tolle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graber, John|title=Perception Management an Important Tool|date= 8 September 2001|publisher=The Olympian [Olympia], South Sound sec.

==Business==
Businesses shape the perceptions of the public in order to get the desired behavior and [[purchase pattern]]s from [[consumer]]s.

=== Advertising ===
In terms of [[advertising]] and [[brand image]], without a perception to manage, no other form of communication can happen. That certainly highlights the importance of the brand image. However, some research{{which|date=October 2013}} indicates that just being a known brand dramatically affects how consumers perceive it. A consumer may rationalize that if they have heard of a brand, the company must be spending a fair sum on advertising.  If it is spending a lot on advertising, then the company must be reasonably profitable which means that other consumers must be buying the product and they must be satisfied enough with its performance; therefore, the product must be of reasonable quality. Sometimes managing perception can simply just mean giving consumers a perception. Advertising, without even considering its message and quality, adds to consumer opinions in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emma Macdonald|author2=Byron Sharp|title=Management Perceptions of the Importance of Brand Awareness as an Indication of Advertising Effectiveness|year=2003|journal=Marketing Bulletin|volume=14|pp=141–11|url=http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1358443361.1051brand70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brand management ===
Companies{{which|date=October 2013}} often use [[brand management]] in an attempt to change a potential customer's perception of the product's value. Through positive association, a brand manager can strengthen the company's [[marketing]] and gain brand value. This is an important step in perception management because it aims at producing the most effective results. Brand management deals with competitors, promotions, costs, and satisfaction in order to earn trust from consumers and show positive feedback.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Leadership ===
People can use perception management as a way to positively enhance their [[leadership]] abilities.  A person's ability to manage perceptions is what sets great leaders apart.  What people – followers – appraise as effectiveness and ability as a leader becomes their perception, which then becomes reality.  Unmanaged perceptions of a person's followers create a reality opposite to what was wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Jeffery S.|title=Are You Managing Perception?|journal=Leadership and Management in Engineering|date=April 2001|volume=1|issue=2|p=2|type=Editor's Letter|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2001)1%3A2(2)|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2001)1:2(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
The best medium for businesses to affect the perceptions of the public is through [[marketing]]. To get people to buy products, marketers must identify a ''need'' and manage the perception of the public so that they feel the product will fulfill that need.

This is not the same thing as manipulation, where businesses create something people don't need, and marketers convince them that they do need it. Good perception management is to the benefit of the consumer, as it fulfills more of the customer's needs, and to the benefit of the business, as it increases their revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith, B.|year=1994|title=Perception Management|publisher=The Empire Club of Canada Speeches 1994-1995|url=http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?FT=yes&amp;SpeechID=1270|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130172724/http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?FT=yes&amp;SpeechID=1270|archivedate=2016-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some{{which|date=October 2013}} marketing schemas, marketers create a need that was not present and then offer to fulfill that need. A good example of this is credit card companies. [[Credit card]] companies are companies that, like most other companies, started off by providing a convenience to the population.

Credit cards offer an alternative method of payment to cash or check and make life simpler for many people; however, today there are over 600 million credit cards issued in the United States alone and four major credit card companies.&lt;ref name="creditcards.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php#most-popular-searches |title=Credit card statistics, industry facts, debt statistics |publisher=Creditcards.com |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer even possible to buy a car, get a home loan, or rent an apartment from many companies without a positive [[credit score]].

This fact has necessitated the need for almost every citizen to have a credit card. However, many credit cards companies manage their perception to make sure that people continue to need credit cards, and control their perception so that many people do not fully understand what they are getting into. However, the fact that the average household in the United States is in over fifteen thousand dollars worth of debt never reaches the widespread public.&lt;ref name="creditcards.com"/&gt; Instead, they publicize how they will help if a card gets stolen, or that they have the lowest interest percentage compared to the other major competitors. But no company tells their customers that the promoted [[interest rate]] more than doubles if they do not pay the minimum balance on time. For instance, [[Discover Card|Discover's]] interest rate increases to 18.99% after the first minimum balance is not paid on time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discovercard.com/cardmembersvcs/acqs/app/exec?dynaviewMain=INFO&amp;brand=MORE&amp;sc=KBL9&amp;icmpgn=1007_cc_grdt_cbcterm_btn_001 Discover Card Contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, though credit cards are convenient and fulfill a need, the companies often make no mention of the negative effects that they might have on many of their users.

=== Risk management ===
{{see|risk management}}
The decision making process in relation to the future is an element of business that has a great effect on the company's future. If the company is too risk averse, this leads to underperformance, and a missed opportunity. If the company takes too many risks, it is likely that there will be a large amount of losses. Ultimately if this amount of risk taking leads the perception of the company to exceed the boundaries of logic and fact, the company will most likely fail based on their poor perception.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Beaumont. "Perception and meltdowns.(RISK MANAGEMENT)." Risk &amp; Insurance 18.12 (Oct 1, 2007): 20(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Companies today cannot afford not to manage perceptions. Though not a substitute for a substantial product, it is useful in "sustaining the offering" for a length of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/management/general/20040720_perception.html |title=The art of perception management |publisher=domain-b.com |date=2004-07-20 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International business ===
The communication gaps that exist in international business can lead to misunderstandings. Perception management helps to prevent the complex emotional characteristics of communication from changing the original interpretation of the message. Perception management also serves to change the original interpretation of the message in order to prevent complex emotional characteristics in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, Tony, "Viewpoint: Perception Management Crucial for International Business", Wisconsin School of Business, September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception management services===
The phrase "perception management" is filtering into common use as a synonym for "persuasion". Public relations firms now offer "perception management" as one of their services. Similarly, public officials who are being accused of shading the truth are now frequently charged with engaging in "perception management" when disseminating information to media or to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/Perception_management |title=Perception management : Who, What, Where, When |publisher=Servinghistory.com |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food industry and nutrition professionals==
Food and beverage manufacturers can manage the perceptions of consumers by controlling information on food labels. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requires a label on most food sold in grocery stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for industry: a food labeling guide|date=October 2009|publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate= November 17, 2011|url= http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FDA does not regulate [[dietary supplement]]s. Many [[chain restaurant]]s also try to make their food appear to be healthier but serve too large of a portion. [[Fast food restaurant]]s use advertising to make their food appear healthier when they have not changed anything about it either. Consumers have to consider where their health and nutrition information is coming from. When one gets nutrition information from the media, one is getting it from the [[food industry]] and companies that could benefit from customers purchasing their products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On labels and packaging there are many different perception management techniques they use.

Here are some deceptive practices:
* Distribute [[sugar]] amounts among many ingredients
* Include "[[health claim|healthy]]" ingredients to make it appear to be healthy
* Use scientific names of ingredients to mask their [[nutritional value]]
* Use advertising or [[catch phrase]]s to sell their product
* Not including contaminants (heavy metal, toxic substances)
* Using phrases like "[[downplaying|zero]] grams of [[trans fat]]" because there is less than one gram in the serving size. This means there can be more than a gram of trans fat in the product though.
* Saying that a product is "packed in fiber" when that fiber may not be whole grain fiber. That means the fiber is coming from a less nutritious or healthy source.
* Using doctor recommendations or seals of approval on products to sell them. Companies are not even required to have doctors say that to use it on their packaging.
* A product can be "[[low fat]]" but that does not mean it is low in calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dusen, A. V.|date=29 July 2008|title=Nine ways food labels mislead|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate= November 17, 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/29/health-labels-food-forbeslife-cx_avd_0729health.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product's name can also be misleading. For instance, the food industry advertises [[high fructose corn syrup]] as being made from corn without artificial ingredients, having the same calories as sugar and acceptable when used in moderation. Despite its name, high fructose corn syrup is simply a sugar made from corn or an added sugar in the diet. It is not high in fructose as its name would suggest. High fructose corn syrup is composed of the same two simple sugars (fructose and glucose) as table sugar, honey and maple syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Knowles|date=September 14, 2010|title=CRA Petitions FDA for Use of "Corn Sugar|publisher=SweetSurprise.com|url=http://www.sweetsurprise.com/news-and-press/press-releases/corn-sugar-fda-petition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic food industry===
Many myths about the [[organic food]] industry have been spreading from either public fear or rare stories reported in the news. The International Federation of Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) cited 42 of these myths about organic food and provided counterarguments to them. A few are listed below.
* Myth 2: No pattern of research that declares a difference in nutrition between organic and non-organic food exists.
Counter-argument: Organics have proven to have lower level of [[pesticides]], they contain higher amounts of vitamins and minerals, and do not have hydrogenated fats. They go on to describe in detail each of these arguments in the article.
* Myth 3: The organic food industry is responsible for spreading fear about conventionally produced products so that they can increase their profit.
Counter-argument: The same thing happens with the conventional production companies spreading fear about organic foods, advertisement about the benefits of organic produce is done largely by individuals and not the companies themselves.
* Myth 4: You are more likely to get [[food poisoning]] from organic food because they potentially have more dangerous bacteria due to the lack of pesticide use.
* Myth 7: The pesticides that organic farming uses may be natural, but actually are more harmful because they are less effective and thus used in higher quantities.
Counter-argument: Farmers only use natural pesticides when all other measures have been used, continual research is being done to find alternatives to even the natural pesticides applied to the fields.&lt;ref name="International Federation of Agriculture Movements"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criticisms and Frequent Misconceptions about Organic Agriculture: The Counter-Arguments Part A: Organic foods are not healthier than non-organic foods/Organic foods are unhealthy.|url=http://classic.ifoam.org/growing_organic/2_policy/criticisms_misconceptions_main_page.php|work=Criticisms and Frequent Misconceptions about Organic Agriculture: The Counter-Arguments|accessdate=22 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019062647/http://classic.ifoam.org/growing_organic/2_policy/criticisms_misconceptions_main_page.php|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition professionals===
Perception management is essentially a means for which an image or reputation can be created and maintained, whether it is true or not. On September 24, 2011, The [[American Dietetic Association]] announced it would change its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In this case, the ADA is adjusting its name to more accurately describe the organization.  According to Escott-Stump, "The name Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics promotes the strong science background and academic expertise of our members."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ryan O'Malley |author2=Allison MacMunn |date=September 24, 2011 |title=New name, same commitment to public's nutritional health: American Dietetic Association becomes Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics |publisher=eatright.org |url=http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442465361 |access-date=2011-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130023624/http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442465361 |archive-date=2011-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that by adding the word nutrition to its name, the organization is better able to communicate its ability to transfer nutritional science and research into healthy lifestyles and foods everyone can understand.  Also, by keeping dietetics, it creates a connection between the new research and the history and reputation ADA has as a food and science-based profession.  Escott-Stump reassured the public that although the name is changing, the organization's mission will remain the same as it has been for nearly 100 years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The [[Society for the Study of Addiction]] published a paper by researchers at the Deaken University School of Psychology, Australia, about a study of use of public relations companies by the [[alcohol industry]].  The study proposes that "...alcohol industry 'social aspects/public relations' organizations (SAPROs) serve the agenda of lending credibility to industry claims of [[corporate responsibility]] while promoting ineffective industry-friendly interventions (such as school-based education or TV advertising campaigns) and creating doubt about interventions which have a strong evidence base (such as higher taxes on alcoholic beverages)."

The study concluded that Australian SAPRO [[Drinkwise]] "has been used by the alcohol industry to create an impression of [[social responsibility]] while promoting interventions that maintain profits and campaigning against effective interventions such as higher taxes on alcohol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Peter G.|author2=de Groot, Florentine|author3=McKenzie, Stephen|author4=Droste, Nicolas|title=Alcohol industry use of social aspect public relations organizations against preventative health measures|journal=Society for the Study of Addiction|date=10 May 2011|volume=106|series=Vested Interests|pages=1560–1567|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03499}} {{Dead link |date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion and design industry==
Perception management is a robust component in the [[fashion industry]]. Fashion stylists are responsible for providing perception management in the branding of products, and in creating the public persona of both individuals, businesses, and brands, through means of wardrobe, appearance, and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan W. Fashion Stylist. August 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As with any product, perception management influences purchasing decisions. According to one analyst, "In the external environment, the offerings of competitors, with which a customer compares a product or service will change, thus altering his perception of the best offer around. Another point is that the public opinion towards certain issues can change. This effect can reach from [[fashion trend]]s to the public expectation of good corporate citizenship." Other effects of perception management in fashion include that "a commonplace strategy to circumvent the loss of exclusivity associated with high [[market share]] is to leverage the brand by introducing new related brands. This is very efficient with fragrances or fashion brands."&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Recklies, "Understanding and Managing Customer Perception", University Press, July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity==
[[Public relation]] firms are now offering services to [[celebrity]] clients in perception management or [[reputation repair]]. It is a new tool for public firms that lets large firms pour huge resources to the public through websites. The web helps public relations executives to reach out the news media and it offer ways to link the public relations people and news media. For example, firms provide direct email addresses of some business journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sreenath Sreenivasan|title=New Tools for Public Relations Firms|date=March 31, 1997|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/31/business/new-tools-for-public-relations-firms.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new trend in perception management is athletes signing with major public relation firms. Well-known agencies, such as [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris]] and competitor [[Creative Artists Agency]], recently started attracting huge sports stars. Alex Rodriguez joined the company after his alleged affair with Madonna, during the summer of 2008. He is following in the footsteps of [[Serena Williams]], [[Kevin Garnett]], and [[Vince Young]], who are all represented by the William Morris agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brooks Barnes|title=Rodriguez Signs with Hollywood Talent Agency|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/business/media/22arod.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of [[Britney Spears]], the media has tarnished and skewed the way she is perceived by the public.  In a short January 2007 interview conducted by contactmusic.com, Spears exclaims, "the media has had a lot of fun exaggerating my every move".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/britney-blames-media-for-skewed-perception_1018166 |title=Britney Spears &amp;#124; Britney Blames Media For "Skewed Perception" |publisher=Contactmusic |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another case of media skewing our interpretation of celebrities is in the case of [[Miley Cyrus]]. After her music video controversy, ''[[Can't Be Tamed]]'', her album sales declined to 72% less than her 2008 solo debut, ''[[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|Breakout]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/fashion/11miley.html?ref=miley_cyrus | work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | title=Fans of Miley Cyrus Question Her New Path | date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and privacy==
Results from a survey conducted in Hamburg in 2006 suggest that [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) has little to do with manufacturing security/feelings of safety among people. It seems that preceding spatial perceptions have a greater impact on whether a certain space or place is regarded as being unsafe or not.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Universities==
A research article in the journal ''Disability &amp; Society'' gives an account of students with hidden disabilities and their experience with the behavior of their peers when their disability is revealed. These students actively manage the perception of others because the awareness of their disability "altered the behavior of others towards them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Olney, M.F.|author2=Brockelman, K.F.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Out of the Disability Closet: strategic use of perception management by select university students with disabilities|journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=18|issue=1|date= January 2003|pp=35–50 (16)|doi=10.1080/713662200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy and terrorism==
Perception management has long been a key issue in the United States government. Beginning in the 1950s, the CIA contracted out several hundred different public information and news agencies for different "assignments". This practice grew, and currently operates with several thousand initiatives helping to privately shape public opinion of the government. Indeed, the Department of Defense views perception management as a psychological operation aimed at eliciting the desired behavior by manipulating the opinions of both enemies and friends. Best put by the DOD directly, "Perception management combines truth projection, operations security, cover and deception, and psychological operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/388/59/ |title=The evolution of perception management tactics (06/04) |publisher=Towardfreedom.com |date=2005-06-03 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the U.S. engaged in the [[War on Terror]], perception management tactics have become vital to military success and relations with other countries.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...It is absolutely vital that the Perception Management campaign of the United States and its allies be coordinated at the highest possible level, that it be resourced adequately, and executed effectively. Properly coordinated, such a campaign could be a war-winning capability. When left uncoordinated, such operations will achieve only modest success, at best, and at worst, could seriously backfire. Even a poorly chosen word, used in the heat of the moment (e.g. 'crusade'), can have significant negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garfield, A.|year=2002|title=The Offence of Strategic Influence: Making the Case for Perception Management|journal=Journal of Information Warfare|volume=1|issue=3|publisher=School of Computer and Information Science, Edith Cowan University|location=Western Australia|accessdate=2010-11-05|url=http://www.jinfowar.com/journals/archives/vol-1/v1-issue-3/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320153533/http://www.jinfowar.com/journals/archives/vol-1/v1-issue-3/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-20|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Politics==
Perception management in politics is referred to as "[[political marketing]] strategy", or "strategic political marketing".  It originated from traditional business marketing strategies applied to politics, largely for the purpose of winning elections.  [[Political parties]] and actors can choose between two fundamental methods: leading the market or following the market.  Leading the market involves fulfilling underlying demands of principle, and a political actor would essentially assume the position of one who leads on their own ideas and principles.  Following the market entails the political actor's reliance on research such as [[public opinion surveys]] and adoption of those principles and ideas held by the majority of the people who the political actor wishes to influence.

Central to political marketing is the concept of strategic political postures—positions organizations assume to prompt the desired perceptions in a target group. Each strategic political posture relies on a different mix of leading and following, and includes four general types of postures:
* the political lightweight: neither leads nor follows very well; does not represent a posture easily sustained; is not confident in own ideals or particularly concerned with adapting to the needs and wants of constituents.
* the convinced [[ideologist]]: leads exceedingly well, holding its own opinions and endeavoring to convince others of their merit.
*  the tactical [[populist]]: emphasizes following to achieve power; focuses on adopting political policies that appeal to a majority in order to attain the political power necessary to implement a party's goals.
* the relationship builder: both leads and follows; has confidence in own ideas but able to adapt to the needs and wants of constituents.
Political [[market orientation]] (PMO) originated from commercial market orientation strategies applied to a political environment. Developed by Robert Ormrod, the comprehensive PMO model involves four attitudinal constructs and four behavioral methods:

Organizational attitudes include:
* Internal orientation: focuses on including and acknowledging the importance of other party members and their opinions
* Voter orientation: focuses on the importance of current and future [[voters]] and the awareness of their needs.
* Competitor orientation: focuses on awareness of competitors' positions and strengths, and acknowledges that cooperation with competing parties can advance the party's long-term goals.
* External orientation: focuses on the importance of parties that are neither voters nor competitors, including [[news media|media]], [[Advocacy group|interest groups]], and [[lobbyists]].

Organizational behaviors include:
* Information generation: focuses on gathering information about every party involved in a given issue.
* Information dissemination: focuses on receiving and communicating information, both formally and informally.
* Member participation: focuses on involving all party members, through vigorous discussion and debate, to create a consistent party strategy.
* Consistent Strategy Implementation: focuses on implementing consistent, established strategies through formal and informal channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ormrod, R.

== Journalism ==
[[Journalism]] is a field that organizations, companies, governments, and individuals will attempt to use to manage the public's perception of that specific organization, company, government, or person. Perception management through journalism has been seen especially in regard to government propaganda and war. This becomes problematic when governments promote certain ideas that they want the public to believe through journalism, without the journalists and media properly attributing their sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shah, A.|date=2005-03-31|title= War, propaganda and the media-global issues|url= http://www.globalissues.org/article/157/war-propaganda-and-the-media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in the journalism field is between the corporate business of keeping a news organization afloat versus the ethics of reporting and reporting the truth. Just as with any other major corporation or even small businesses there are conflicts between the reporters and the executives within a news organization. Reporters with strong ethics will want to run all stories that are "newsworthy", but some of those stories may be [[censored]] by editors because the executives have sent a note down the chain specifying that a certain story may or may not run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Campbell, D.|year=2000|title=After the wall|publisher= [[American Journalism Review]]|url= http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
A newly emerging section of [[psychology]] known as positive psychology has to do with controlling one's perception of the world. [[Positive psychology]] says that in order to be most successful, one must perceive the world in a positive light. This means controlling one's thoughts, feelings, and outlook on life so that they are all positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://controversiesinpsychology.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/why-do-we-need-positive-psychology-why-now/ |title=Why do we need Positive Psychology, Why now? « Controversies in Psychology |publisher=Controversiesinpsychology.wordpress.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://controversiesinpsychology.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/positive-psychology-and-its-benefits-in-children/ |title=Positive Psychology and Its Benefits In Children « Controversies in Psychology |publisher=Controversiesinpsychology.wordpress.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restaurants, the staff will frequently overestimate the wait time for a group of customers to be seated because when they are seated quicker, they experience increased satisfaction and perceive the restaurant in a more favorable manner.  Psychology is important in for perception management to be effective, because knowing the way the human mind functions and thinks is necessary to give the customers the satisfaction they want and expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maister, D.|year=1985|title= The Psychology of Waiting Lines|url= http://davidmaister.com/articles/5/52/|publisher=davidmaister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Baseball player [[Sammy Sosa]] used perception management after he was ejected from a game in 2003 when he was caught using a [[corked bat]].  His explanation was that he only uses the corked bat for batting practice so he can hit more home runs and put on a show for fans.  He claimed picking up the corked bat for the game was an honest mistake and apologized to everybody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sammy Sosa ejected for corked bat|date=4 June 2003|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=November 18, 2011|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,88522}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of hitting home runs even with the corked bat could have helped Sammy Sosa hit future home runs without a corked bat because he knew what it felt like to hit a home run and he knew that he could do it. 
Golfer [[Arnold Palmer]] used perception management as well. In the [[1960 U.S. Open (golf)|1960 U.S. Open]], Palmer saw the first hole at Cherry Hills as an eagle opportunity. He perceived that if he could simply drive the ball into the longer rough in order to slow it down before it rolled across the very fast green, he could make the putt for eagle. Many doubted Palmer when he spoke of doing so, but that did not stop him. Palmer did exactly what he perceived of doing, making the eagle, and later going on to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Palmer, Arnold |author2=William Barry.

A study performed in June 2008 revealed that perception is closely correlated with performance. Nine different sized black circles were glued onto a white background. After a round of golf, forty-six golfers were asked which black circle was the size of the hole on the putting greens. The players with the overall better scores perceived the hole to be bigger than it actually is, so they chose the bigger black circles. The players with the worse scores perceived the hole as being smaller than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Witt, J. K.|author2=S. A. Linkenauger|author3=J. Z. Bakdash|author4=D. R.

=== Training ===
In the profession of [[athletic training]] there are many controversies, but none greater than the treatment and management of [[concussion]]s. For many years people{{who|date=October 2013}} viewed concussions and big tackles in football games as athletes just "getting their bell rung" and coaches implored them to "shake it off and get back in the game". However, substantial research{{which|date=October 2013}} has shown that a concussion is a [[traumatic brain injury]] that may temporarily interfere with the way the brain works and can affect memory, judgment, reflexes, speech, balance, coordination and sleep patterns. A study from the National Center for Injury Prevention found that 47% of high school football players say they suffer a concussion each season, with 37% of those reporting multiple concussions in a season. Such serious injuries deserve appropriate attention to treatment and to prevention. With a concussion, function may be interrupted but there is no structural damage to the brain, so the physical examination often appears normal. The American College of Sports Medicine estimates that 85% of sports-related concussions go undiagnosed because athletes deny or fail to report symptoms and because subtle changes in brain function may not be obvious on a single examination. This May{{when|date=October 2013}} new standards for concussion management that were realized, and stated that if an athlete was involved in a play where a concussion was possible (a direct blow to the head), the athlete is supposed to be evaluated by a certified athletic trainer or a qualified physician if available. The new standards go on to say that if the athlete has any signs of a concussion, they are not able to return to play for the rest of the game or practice. According to the ''New York Times'', this seems like a good policy in theory, but with football season being over for a large majority of high schools (football having the highest risk of concussion), experts are finding that athletes have found ways to get around the standards, such as denying any concussion symptoms they are having, learning how to answer questions to hide any signs of concussion, or not saying anything about the possible concussion to the athletic trainer or physician working at the game. With these strategies, athletes put themselves at risk for the "second concussion", which can leave permanent brain damage and can even lead to death. Although in theory these new standards for concussions are great for significantly reducing the risk of missing symptoms that appear after 24 hours and preventing any further brain damage, but with athletes now hiding possible concussions from athletic trainers and physicians, these standards may actually have a negative effect on concussion management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schwarz, A.|date=7 June 2009|title=New guidelines on young athletes' concussions stir controversy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/sports/08concussions.html|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welge|first=J|title=Concussions are not something to mess around with|url=http://football.dailyherald.com/story/?id=50569|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Daily Herald|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sponsorship ===
Perception management is the idea of using an image as a tool for identification of [[sponsorship]] opportunities. An effective sponsorship relationship outlines a good match between the image the company wants to promote and the image of the sponsored body, and if successful, elevates both. Perception management directs both behavior and communication activities as it works towards the establishment of a common vision of reality in a given [[social group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ferrand, Alain|title=Image management in sport organizations: the creation of value|work=European Journal of Marketing|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=853601&amp;show=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impacts ===
[[Professional sports teams]]{{which|date=October 2013}} in the United States are beginning to engage in [[Corporate environmental responsibility|corporate pro-environmental behavior]] (CPEB). Many sports leagues and teams{{which|date=October 2013}} have pledged commitments to [[sustainability]] in areas such as their facilities, venues, and major events. Even events on a global scale such as the [[Olympic Games]] and [[FIFA World Cup]], emphatically have endorsed the reduction of their environmental impacts. Not only can the teams benefit economically and ecologically, but "for-profit businesses may also engage in CPEB in order to control its public image, reputation, and identity." They want to make sure they are in good standing with the public since they realize that many of them now relate to the "green" lifestyle. While fans act as the consumers of the teams product's and events, non-fans can also "have significant influence as voters on sport facility subsidization referenda". That being said, it is very important for the sports teams to maintain a positive image, and "going green" can do just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Kellison, Timothy|title=Organizational Perception Management as a means to Legitimate Sports Venue Subsidization|conference=Sports Entertainment &amp; Venues Tomorrow|year=2011|pp=44–46|accessdate=22 November 2011|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.1680&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{see also|Censorship in China}}
The [[Chinese government]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] exert control over many forms of [[media in China]], including newspapers and the Internet. All Chinese media, including newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, TV stations, broadcasting, the movie industry and art performances, are categorized and managed as "mouthpieces" of the Communist Party, used to manipulate [[public opinion]] and exercise "[[mind control]]" on its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2007/ea_china_08_10.asp |title=World Tribune — Former official: China's 'perception management' agenda controls all media |publisher=Worldtribune.com |date=2007-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mind control" includes "[[indoctrination]] from kindergarten to college through officially compiled textbooks, as all teachers are categorized as 'educators of CCP' (The Chinese Communist Party)". According to Qinglian He, a former Chinese government propagandist and now a senior researcher at Human Rights in China, by exercising "mind control", the Chinese government has misled the Chinese population about the values of human rights and [[democracy]], and also about the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China's 'perception management' agenda controls all media|work=World Tribune|date=August 10, 2007|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2007/ea_china_08_10.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Propaganda and Information Leading Group is generally responsible for [[censorship]] and control of information.

Chinese military scholars{{who|date=October 2013}} argue that their nation has a long history of conducting "psychological operations", a phrase that connotes important aspects of strategic deception and, to a certain degree, what the US Department of Defense portrays as perception management. For example, several articles published by the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]'s [[Academy of Military Science (China)|Academy of Military Science]] (AMS) journal ''Zhongguo Junshi Kexue'', examine psychological warfare and psychological operations mainly as a deception-oriented function of military strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anderson, Eric|author2=Engstrom, Jeffrey|year=2009|title=China's use of perception management and strategic deception|publisher=U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission|url=http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/ApprovedFINALSAICStrategicDeceptionPaperRevisedDraft06Nov2009_0.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228142352/http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/ApprovedFINALSAICStrategicDeceptionPaperRevisedDraft06Nov2009_0.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government has also used strategies to manage the perception of their country to the rest of the world. Facing criticisms about its questionable domestic [[human rights]] policies, the Chinese government successfully deflected international media's attention during the [[2008 Beijing Summer Olympics]] to the apolitical Olympic ideals by creating intensive coverage of the positive feedback for the Olympics on paper, TV, and online, despite governmental officers' promises to improve their poor history of protecting human rights when Beijing was still competing for the right to host the game in 2001.&lt;ref name=htworld&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/21_Lord_2009.pdf |title=Hosting the World: Perception Management and the Beijing Olympics |journal=Southeast Review of Asian Studies |volume=31|year=2009|pages= 272–81|author=Jim Lord|publisher=[[Bob Jones University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The images and video captured that night by Chinese media would display only the packed, patriotic crowds and nothing of the rest of the celebrants, who were largely occupied with taking photos of themselves with friends, family, and even security personnel.&lt;ref name=htworld/&gt; The Beijing games were also an opportunity for China to show its rapid development. The presence of a large contingent of foreign businessmen, media, and politicians necessitated a strict system of perception management before and during the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=htworld/&gt; The government wanted to ensure that it could use this opportunity to portray China as positively as possible by showcasing its development and modernity rather than some of its more internationally disliked features such as its domestic human rights policies and frequent government protests. China looked at its opportunity to host the Olympic Games as "a definitive demonstration of its status as a world partner comparable to any power in the Western world".&lt;ref name=htworld/&gt; They made certain that those who would be directly talking to the media had the "right" talking points; mostly these focused on promoting the stability and dominance of [[China's economy]]. The government restructured the landscape of [[Beijing]] to portray a sense of modernity to foreigners. Three new buildings called the "bird buildings" were constructed at a high cost, forcing a large number of residents to relocate. A couple of new subway lines are also built to increase the convenience for foreigners to reach the [[Olympic village]]. The government also did whatever it could to make the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics more impressive and extravagant than any before. An example of how they managed perceptions in this realm was the intentional substitution of a more attractive girl, [[Lin Miaoke]], to [[lip-sync]] "[[Ode to the Motherland]]" instead of using the original singer. In their opinion of the officials in charge, the original singer wasn't attractive enough to favorably represent China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnay |first=Jacquelin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2545387/Beijing-Olympics-Faking-scandal-over-girl-who-sang-in-opening-ceremony.html |title=Beijing Olympics: Faking scandal over girl who 'sang' in opening ceremony |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing's security forces were also greatly increased before and during the Olympic Games to ensure that no large protests could be started and possibly caught on camera by the media. [[Re-education through labor|Re-education camp]]s and [[imprisonment]] were possible punishments for Chinese citizens who made known a desire to protest around the Games. The government also announced a few days prior to the opening ceremonies that three "demonstration parks" would be opened for protests, requiring a written request form five days in advance, although none of the requests were granted. Promotional materials are also made as ideal as possible, for example the slogan "[[One World, One Dream]]" referring to a unifying ideal of "love for all mankind". There was even the creation of a slogan ("[[Beijing Welcomes You]]"), and [[Fuwa|five stuffed animal mascots]] used to portray Beijing and China as harmonious and cordial.&lt;ref name=htworld/&gt;

==Authors==
[[John Grisham]]'s new book ''[[The Appeal]]'' is about a multimillion-dollar suit against a chemical company in Mississippi that dumped harmful chemicals in the water supply to save money. The chemical company tries to pay off a Supreme Court justice to get out of any [[punitive damage|punitive]] monetary damages or civil charges. Grisham gives details in his book about one of the executives for the chemical company hiring a "government relations" firm in order to get a political stance on their issue and turn the company's image around.

[[David Baldacci]]'s book, ''[[The Whole Truth (novel)|The Whole Truth]]'', involves a shady perception management firm that creates an anti-Russia campaign for one of the largest international arms dealers. This perception management company "employs various strategies at a [[grassroots]] YouTube level, as well as selectively leaking information to the corporate media, that seek to blame Russia for a host of terrible atrocities." The main character's fiancé is killed because she starts to suspect foul play with all of the anti-Russia campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mark hand |url=http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/grishambaldacci05252008/ |title=Perception Management |publisher=Press Action |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415014414/http://www.pressaction.com/news/weblog/full_article/grishambaldacci05252008/ |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies==
People in the movie industry can also use perception management through the movies they choose to make. One movie, ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', changed many people's minds in a study comparing watchers and non-watchers views on global warming. The study, conducted by [[Anthony Leiserowitz]], asked both groups how concerned they were about [[global warming]], and 83 percent of watchers said they were very concerned compared to 72 percent of non-watchers. They also asked the watchers whether the movie made them less or more worried about global warming and 49 percent said they were more worried after seeing the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leiserowitz, Anthony A.|title=Before and after The Day After Tomorrow: a U.S. study of climate change risk perception|journal=Environment|volume=46|issue=9|year=2004|p=22+|publisher=Academic OneFile|url=http://environment.yale.edu/leiserowitz/climatechange/TDAT_assets/LeiserowitzTDAT2.pdf|doi=10.1080/00139150409603663}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perception management is also important in the movie industry in terms of celebrity image. For example, much of the controversy over the 2010 Oscar-winning ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' centers around the fact that [[Natalie Portman]] is said to have danced for most of the movie. However, her double, [[Sarah Lane]], claims that the majority of the dancing was done by herself. When she mentioned this in interviews, Lane noted that she was quickly told to keep quiet. The movies' producers were worried that this information would reflect negatively on Portman and affect her chances of winning an Oscar. Lane noted in an interview with ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' that "They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half" (Katrandjian 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katrandjian, Olivia |author2=Kimberly Launier |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sarah Lane, Natalie Portman's 'Black Swan' Dance Double, Speaks Out|work=[[ABC News]]|date= 20 Nov 2011|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sarah-lane-natalie-portmans-black-swan-dance-double/story?id=13375693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment ==
Recently{{when|date=October 2013}} the [[Canadian government]] has been accused of "hiding the truth" of [[global warming]] and cutting much needed funds to research and development programs. Graham Saul of [[Climate Action Network]] of Canada said, "This government says they take [[climate change]] seriously but they do nothing and try to hide the truth about climate change." ''[[The Guardian]]'' claims that 300,000 people die each year and 125 billion dollars are lost a year to gradual climate change caused by global warming. However, internal government documents show that [[media coverage]] regarding global warming have been cut by 80 percent, and strict rules and regulations have blocked scientists from talking to reporters. Several science research bases across Canada have run out of government funding and were forced to shut down. Funding for the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmosphere Sciences, which researches the melting of polar ice and frequency of Arctic storms, is also drying up. Many climatology researchers{{who|date=October 2013}} across the globe believe that Canada is falling behind in climate science and because of this the world is not getting any information about what is happening in the [[Canadian Arctic]]. The Canadian government has admitted to eliminating government-funded climate research so there won't be any "bad news" about what is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leahy, S.|title=Canadian government 'hiding truth about climate change', report claims|work=[[The Guardian]]|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/18/climate-change-canada|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking==
[[Social networking]] currently provides more information and features than original function of allowing individuals to connect with their peers. Social networking sites have a large amount of data and records from billions of people, and construct recommendations used by enterprises, small business, and individuals. For example, [[Facebook]] has a [[recommendation system]] that allows users to indicate what "news articles, companies and celebrities they 'like{{'"}} and "shares data about those preferences with its Web partners", so "when a Facebook user visits a Web site like [[Yelp]] or [[TripAdvisor]], they are shown reviews from friends before they get to those from strangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wortham, J.|date=September 12, 2010|title=Search takes a social turn|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/technology/13search.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies also use social networking to investigate candidates and employees. The results obtained from a potential employee's immediate social network are often more relevant, significant, and factual than what the candidate presents about themselves during an interview. Therefore, it is necessary to manage how one wants to be perceived on one's social network. There are several ways that perception management can help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott, D.|date=March 31, 2011|title=Social networking redux: perception management|publisher=IT Knowledge Exchange|url=http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/business-technology/social-networking-redux-perception-management/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1165">The '''philosophy of psychiatry''' explores [[philosophical]] questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The [[philosopher of science]] and [[philosophy of medicine|medicine]] Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a [[science]], using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the [[concept]]s employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the [[ethics|normative]] questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015).

&lt;/ref&gt;  remaining as a byproduct. It is used commercially as a form of [[waste treatment]] and has been tested for the gasification of [[municipal solid waste]], [[biomass]], [[industrial waste]], [[hazardous waste]], and solid [[hydrocarbons]], such as [[coal]], [[oil sands]], [[Petroleum coke|petcoke]] and [[oil shale]].&lt;ref name=kalinenko/&gt;

== Process ==
Small plasma torches typically use an [[inert gas]] such as [[argon]] where larger torches require [[nitrogen]]. The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

The waste is heated, melted and finally [[Vaporization|vaporized]]. Only at these extreme conditions can molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] occur by breaking apart [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]]. [[molecule|Complex molecules]] are separated into individual [[atoms]]. The resulting elemental components are in a gaseous phase ([[syngas]]). Molecular dissociation using plasma is referred to as "plasma [[pyrolysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

*   Gasification with starved combustion and rapid quenching of syngas from elevated temperatures can avoid the production of dioxins and furans that are common to incinerators
*   Air emissions can be cleaner than landfills and some incinerators.

== Disadvantages ==

Main disadvantages of plasma torch technologies for waste treatment are:

* Large initial investment costs relative to that of alternatives, including landfill&lt;ref&gt;

* Operational costs are high relative to that of incineration.
* Little or even negative net energy production.
* Wet feed stock results in less syngas production and higher energy consumption.
* Frequent maintenance and limited plant availability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6796">{{for|formal and natural language features to indicate quantity|Quantifier (logic)|Quantifier (linguistics)}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[empirical science]], '''quantification''' (or '''quantitation''') is the act of [[counting]] and [[measuring]] that maps human sense [[observation]]s and [[experience]]s into [[quantity|quantities]]. Quantification in this sense is fundamental to the [[scientific method]].

==Natural science==
Some measure of the undisputed general importance of quantification in the [[natural science]]s can be gleaned from the following comments:

* "these are mere facts, but they are quantitative facts and the basis of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell, James McKeen]]; and [[Livingston Farrand|Farrand, Livingston]] (1896) "Physical and mental measurements of the students of Columbia University", ''The Psychological Review'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;6 (1896), pp.&amp;nbsp;618-648; p.&amp;nbsp;648 quoted in ''[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/jcattell.shtml James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) Psychologist, Publisher, and Editor.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* It seems to be held as universally true that "the foundation of quantification is measurement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Stanley Wilks|Wilks, Samuel Stanley]] (1961) "Some Aspects of Quantification in Science", ''Isis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;52, No.&amp;nbsp;2 (1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;135-142; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is little doubt that "quantification provided a basis for the objectivity of science."&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Sungook (2004) "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5690/1569 History of Science: Building Circuits of Trust]", ''Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;305, No.&amp;nbsp;5690 (10 September 2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;1569-1570&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ancient times, "musicians and artists ... rejected quantification, but merchants, by definition, quantified their affairs, in order to survive, made them visible on parchment and paper."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred W. Crosby|Crosby, Alfred W.]] (1996) ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western Society'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any reasonable "comparison between Aristotle and Galileo shows clearly that there can be no unique lawfulness discovered without detailed quantification."&lt;ref&gt;Langs, Robert J. (1987) "[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=cps.023.0555a Psychoanalysis as an Aristotelian Science—Pathways to Copernicus and a Modern-Day Approach]", ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;23 &lt;!-- one vol. per year --&gt;(1987), pp.&amp;nbsp;555-576&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even today, "universities use imperfect instruments called '[[exams]]' to indirectly quantify something they call knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Aaron]] (1999) "[http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1999/vol3/lynch_a.html Misleading Mix of Religion and Science,]" ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;!-- because there are only two issues, and there is Gatherer, Derek G. (1999) "Reply to Commentaries", ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3 [No.&amp;nbsp;2] (1999) http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/1999/vol3/gatherer_reply.html --&gt; (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

This meaning of quantification comes under the heading of [[Pragmatism|pragmatics]].{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

In some instances in the natural sciences a seemingly intangible concept may be quantified by creating a scale—for example, a [[pain scale]] in medical research, or a discomfort scale at the intersection of [[meteorology]] and [[human physiology]] such as the [[heat index]] measuring the combined perceived effect of heat and [[humidity]], or the [[wind chill factor]] measuring the combined perceived effects of cold and wind.

==Social sciences==
{{See also|Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|Quantitative psychological research}}

In the [[social sciences]], quantification is an integral part of [[economics]] and [[psychology]]. Both disciplines gather data – economics by [[empirical observation]] and psychology by [[experimentation]] – and both use [[statistics|statistical techniques]] such as [[regression analysis]] to draw conclusions from it.

In some instances a seemingly intangible property may be quantified by asking subjects to rate something on a [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]—for example, a [[Happiness economics#Methodology|happiness scale]] or a [[Self-Perceived Quality of Life Scale|quality of life scale]]—or by the construction of a scale by the researcher, as with the [[index of economic freedom]]. In other cases, an unobservable variable may be quantified by replacing it with a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy variable]] with which it is highly correlated—for example, per capita [[gross domestic product]] is often used as a proxy for [[standard of living]] or [[quality of life]].

Frequently in the use of regression, the presence or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]], which takes on the value 1 in the presence of the trait or the value 0 in the absence of the trait.

[[Quantitative linguistics]] is an area of [[linguistics]] that relies on quantification. For example,&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan; Perkins, Revere; and Pagliuca, William. (1994) ''The Evolution of Grammar'', Univ. of Chicago Press: ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; indices of [[grammaticalization]] of [[morpheme]]s, such as [[phonology|phonological]] shortness, dependence on surroundings, and fusion with the verb, have been developed and found to be significantly correlated across languages with stage of evolution of function of the morpheme.

==Hard versus soft science==
The ease of quantification is one of the features used to distinguish [[hard and soft science]]s from each other. Scientists often consider hard sciences to be more scientific or rigorous, but this is disputed by social scientists who maintain that appropriate rigor includes the qualitative evaluation of the broader contexts of qualitative data. In some [[social sciences]] such as [[sociology]], quantitative data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable. Thus in these cases [[qualitative methods]] are preferred. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''Skills Development Scotland''' (SDS) is the national skills agency of Scotland. It is an [[executive non-departmental public body]] of the [[Scottish Government]].

==History==
Created on 1 April 2008, SDS is a merger of former organisations and services which delivered skills related services across Scotland.

The former organisations or services that now make up SDS are:

*  Careers Scotland
*  Elements of [[Scottish Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Elements of [[Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise]]'s skills function
*  Scottish University for Industry (learndirect Scotland, learndirect Scotland for business, ILA Scotland and [[#The Big Plus|The Big Plus]])
*  Training for Work
*  Skillseekers
*  Modern Apprenticeships

In 2010, the agency found itself facing funding cuts of more than £20{{nbsp}}million and needing to find 125 voluntary redundancies, one tenth of its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12016425 |title=Redundancies at Skills Development Scotland |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Skills Development Scotland has a presence in most major towns across Scotland.

==The Big Plus==
The Big Plus is an awareness raising campaign in [[Scotland]] targeting adults who might be unable to achieve their aspirations due to a lack of literacy and/or numeracy skills. Formerly part of the Scottish University for Industry, it is now part of Skills Development Scotland.

Adults who respond to the media promotion are put in touch with a local learning provider where they are invited to participate in a program of personal, dedicated learning activities at a local centre. The program aims to help participants reach a level of skills that will enable them to actively engage, with confidence, in personal, family, community and work life. Learning programs are provided by Scottish [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] and are free to resident applicants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">'''Superdiversity''', or '''super-diversity''', is a [[social science]] term and concept often said to have been coined by sociologist Steven Vertovec in a 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'',&lt;ref name=Vertovec&gt;{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Vertovec|title=Super-diversity and its implications|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1024-1054|year=2007|doi=10.1080/01419870701599465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Research focus|publisher=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity|date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which he first used in a [[BBC]] article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4266102.stm |title=Opinion: Super-diversity revealed |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 September 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and usage==
The term superdiversity is used to refer to some current levels of population diversity that are significantly higher than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/superdiversity-institute/about/about-superdiversity.aspx |title=About superdiversity|publisher=University of Birmingham |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec argues superdiversity in Britain "is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade".&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; It denotes increased diversity not only between immigrant and ethnic minority groups, but also within them. It has also been called the "diversification of diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognise superdiversity in S'pore to overcome stereotyping|url=http://www.todayonline.com/daily-focus/education/recognise-superdiversity-spore-overcome-stereotyping|work=Today|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec gives the example of [[Somalis in the United Kingdom]], arguing that the Somali community includes British citizens, [[refugees]] and [[asylum seeker]]s, people granted [[exceptional leave to remain]], undocumented migrants, and [[secondary migrants]] from other European states.&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; Parveen Akhtar, a sociologist at the [[University of Bradford]], argues that the UK is no longer characterized by diversity but by superdiversity: "Post-1945 you had large waves of immigration from fewer places in the world, largely from the former colonies. Now, since the 1980s, you’ve got smaller waves of immigration from a wider range of places".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will 'super diversity' affect the future of British politics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/08/immigration-britains-changing-identity|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Nasar Meer, "Super-diversity has emerged both as a description of empirical phenomena (the proliferation of diversities) and as a normative claim that increased pluralism (both associated with migration as well as wider changes in our understanding of identity categories) requires social scientists and policy makers to develop approaches to register this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Concepts in Race and Ethnicity|first=Nasar|last=Meer|year=2014|location=London|publisher=Sage|isbn=9780857028686|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fran Meissner and Steven Vertovec, writing in 2015, the concept of superdiversity has been the subject of "considerable attention" since Vertovec introduced it in 2005. They note that Vertovec's 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' is the most [[Citation|cited]] article in the history of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing super-diversity|first1=Fran|last1=Meissner|first2=Steven|last2=Vertovec|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=38|issue=4|pages=541–555|year=2015|doi=10.1080/01419870.2015.980295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has started to influence the fields of [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mutsaers|first1=Paul|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Jos|title=Super-diversity at the margins? Youth language in North Brabant, The Netherlands|journal=Sociolinguistic Studies|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–89|doi=10.1558/sols.v6i1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some authors are critical of the concept of superdiversity. Sinfree B. Makoni argues that the concept "contains a powerful sense of social romanticism, creating an illusion of equality in a highly asymmetrical world, particularly in contexts characterized by a search for homogenization...I find it disconcerting, to say the least, to have an open celebration of diversity in societies marked by violent xenophobia, such as South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of Language, Languaging and Supervernacular|first=Sinfree B.|last=Makoni|journal=Muitas Vozes|volume=1|issue=2|pages=189-199|year=2012|doi=10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ana Deumert argues:  “The use of ‘superdiverse’ as a descriptive adjective, is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement” &lt;ref&gt; Deumert, A. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22116958/4/supp/C Digital superdiversity: A commentary. Discourse, Context, and Media,4-5, 116-120].&lt;/ref&gt;
The claims of increased migrations and diversity have been challenged by Czajka and de Haas (2014). They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased . In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a “shrinking pool of prime destination countries”  (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that “the idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview”&lt;ref&gt;Czajka, M. &amp; de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]? International Migration Review, 48, 2, 283-323.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aneta Pavlenko argues that superdiversity is an exercise in academic branding  which  fails as an academic term:&lt;ref&gt;Pavlenko, A (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292157452_Superdiversity_and_why_it_isn't_Reflections_on_terminological_innovations_and_academic_branding Superdiversity and why it isn't: Reflections on terminological innovations and academic branding] &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The uptake of the slippery slogan is not surprising. The aesthetic appeal of truthiness and the illusion of novelty, contemporaneity and relevance undoubtedly explain some of the attraction yet we cannot ignore the fact that the advent of superdiversity provided scholars of multilingualism with a new means to move up the academic ladder, distinguish their publications, and fund their work.}}

==Researchers and research institutes==
Key researchers working on superdiversity include Vertovec, [[Jan Blommaert]] and Jenny Phillimore. The University of Birmingham established the Institute for Research into Superdiversity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elkes |first=Neil |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/superdiversity-represents-real-opportunity-birmingham-4311557 |title=Superdiversity represents real opportunity for Birmingham |work=Birmingham Post |date=14 June 2013|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity]] in [[Göttingen]] is also an important centre for superdiversity research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interlandaston.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/exploring-superdiversity-at-the-max-planck-institute/ |title=Exploring Superdiversity at the Max Planck Institute|website=Interland at Aston University|publisher=Aston University|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's "Superdiversity Stocktake: Impact on Business, Government and on New Zealand" was launched in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73871314/New-Zealand-needs-to-adapt-to-diversity|title=New Zealand needs to adapt to diversity|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored by banks, companies, the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], and the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]. A study on "Implications of Superdiversity for NZ’s Electoral Laws and Democracy" was also launched. Both projects were carried out by the Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business, which describes itself as "a multidisciplinary centre specialising in analysing the law, policy and business implications of New Zealand’s superdiversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Stocktake to launch|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|publisher=Immigration New Zealand|accessdate=2 November 2015|date=1 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202070431/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|archivedate=2 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its patron is Sir [[Anand Satyanand]] and its chair is [[Mai Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Personnel|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/key-personnel/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RISE SICS (previously Swedish Institute of Computer Science) is a leading research institute for applied information and communication technology in Sweden, founded in 1985. 

RISE SICS is a research institute in the most expansive area of industry this century: the total digitalization of products, services and businesses. SICS is in the midst of this revolution, boosting the competitive strength of Swedish industry and the quality and efficiency of Sweden’s public sector. 

In January 2005, SICS had about 88 employees, of which 77 were researchers, 30 with PhD degrees. {{As of|2016|04}}, SICS had about 200 employees, of which 160 were researchers, 83 with [[PhD]] degrees. The institute is headquartered in the [[Kista]] district of [[Stockholm]], with the main office in the Electrum building.

==Software==
Several well-known software packages have been developed at SICS:

*[[Contiki]], an [[operating system]] for small-memory embedded devices
*[[Delegent]], an authorization server
*[[Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment]] or DIVE in short
*[[lwIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s
*[[Oz (programming language)|Oz-Mozart]], a multi-platform programming system
*[[Nemesis (computing)|Nemesis]], a concept [[exokernel]] [[operating system]]
*[[Protothreads]], light-weight stackless [[Thread (computing)|threads]]
*[[Quintus Prolog]] and [[SICStus Prolog]], [[Prolog]] implementations
*[[Simics]], a full-system simulator originally developed at SICS
*[[uIP (micro IP)|uIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s

==Academic output==
The research at SICS results in approximately 100 refereed publications in [[academic journal]]s, conferences and workshops per year. Around 2-4 SICS researchers receive higher [[academic degree]]s per year, and 1-3 persons move to academia for [[tenure]]d positions.

SICS was ranked as the 15th most acknowledged computer science research institution in the world in an article in the December 2004 issue of the highly esteemed journal [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] (PNAS). SICS is the only Swedish institution included in the list, and is one of two European institutions (the other one is [[INRIA]]) alongside 13 well-known American institutions, several of them larger than SICS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407743101 |title=Who gets acknowledged: Measuring scientific contributions through automatic acknowledgment indexing |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

'''Induction''' is the support and guidance provided to novice [[teacher]]s and school administrators in the early stages of their careers. Induction encompasses orientation to the workplace, socialization, [[mentoring]], and guidance through beginning teacher practice.

Comprehensive, high-quality induction consists of several key elements:
* a multi-year program
* rigorous mentor selection and training
* subject-area pairing of mentors and beginning educators
* sufficient time for mentors to meet with and observe new educators
* [[formative assessment]] that assists beginning educators to advance along a continuum of professional growth.

The [[New Teacher Center]] induction model is nationally recognized in the United States for its promotion of new educator development and its impact on teacher retention and student learning.

'''The Energy and Resources Institute''' (TERI) is a [[research institute]] based in [[New Delhi]] that conducts research work in the fields of energy, environment and sustainable development. Established in 1974, it was formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute.  As the scope of its activities widened, it was renamed The Energy and Resources Institute in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/teri-stays-teri-but-says-ta-ta-to-tata/70815/|title=Teri Stays Teri, But Says Ta-Ta To Tata|date=|publisher=Financialexpress.com|accessdate=2003-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bombay House, Tata Group Headquarters in Mumbai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bombay House]] the head office of Tata Group from where TERI started operations]]

The origins of TERI lie in [[Mithapur]], a remote town in [[Gujarat]], where a TATA engineer, Darbari Seth, was concerned about the enormous quantities of energy his factory spent on [[desalination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/teri-championing-the-green-alternative/articleshow/5420185.cms?from=mdr |title=Championing the green alternative |publisher=Economic Times |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the idea of a research institute to tackle the depletion of natural resources and energy scarcity. [[J. R. D. Tata]], chairman of the [[Tata Group|TATA Group]], liked the idea and accepted the proposal. TERI was set up with a modest corpus of 35 million rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.teriin.org/themes/teriday/pdf/5-DSMLecture2006Fifth.pdf |title=Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture 2006 | date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the invitation of the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], TERI was registered in Delhi in 1974 as the Tata Energy Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://envfor.nic.in/envis/compendium/21-teri.pdf |title=ENVIS Centre on Renewable Energy and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
TERI initially began its operations in the [[Bombay House]], Mumbai, headquarters  of [[Tata Group|Tata]]. In 1984, it moved to Delhi where it continued to operate out on the rented premises (which included the [[India International Centre]] ) for almost a decade. In 1993, the organization set up its permanent base in Darbari Seth Block, named after its founder, in the [[India Habitat Centre]] complex located at Lodhi Road, New Delhi. Today TERI has a global presence with many centres in India and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teriin.org/network-linkages | title=Location and Linkages - TERI | date=15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">'''Tolerable daily intake''' ('''TDI''') refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a [[food additive]] which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable [[Risk management|risk]].&lt;ref name=Faustman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Faustman |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Omenn |first2=Gilbert S. |chapter=Risk assessment |editor1-first=Curtis D. |editor1-last=Klaassen |title=Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=92–4 |isbn=978-0-07-134721-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/713810655 |title=Consultation on assessment of the health risk of dioxins; re-evaluation of the tolerable daily intake (TDI): Executive Summary |year=2000 |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=17 |issue=4 |pmid=10912238 |pages=223–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on [[animal experiments]], and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing [[no observable adverse effect level|no observable adverse effect]] (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species.&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Renwick |first1=A.

The [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

== Toxin ==

In contrast, a [[toxin]] is a poison produced naturally by an organism (e.g. plant, animal, insect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46622|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms - toxin|publisher=National Cancer Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 book ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology'' states, "A toxin is a toxicant that is produced by a living organism and is not used as a synonym for toxicant—all toxins are toxicants, but not all toxicants are toxins. Toxins, whether produced by animals, plants, insects, or microbes are generally metabolic products that have evolved as defense mechanisms for the purpose of repelling or killing predators or pathogens."&lt;ref name=Hodgson-2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest Hodgson|title=A Textbook of Modern Toxicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wp20BrihwIC&amp;pg=PT77|date=20 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-21129-8|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes''''', abbreviated in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Treatise on Instrumentation''''' (sometimes '''''Treatise on Orchestration''''') is a technical study of [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical instrument]]s, written by [[Hector Berlioz]]. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on [[conducting]] in 1855.

In 1904, [[Richard Strauss]] was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and included musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated ''Treatise'' with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;''Instrumentationslehre'', Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss, CF Peters, Edition Peters 3120, Leipzig 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic [[Range (music)|range]], [[Timbre|tone quality]], and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the [[orchestra]] is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from [[classical music|classical]] [[Sheet music|scores]] to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] are also frequently cited.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

Many composers studied the work closely, such as [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|R. Strauss]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

'''Urban studies'''  is based on the study of the [[Urban Development|urban development]] of cities. This includes studying the history of city development from an [[Architecture|architectural]] point of view, to the impact of [[urban design]] on [[community development]] efforts. Urban studies helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rural-Communities-Cornelia-Butler-Flora/dp/0813349710/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KE2J30BWZH4HECY3Y5BN|title=Rural Communities: Legacy + Change|last=Flora|first=Cornelia Butler|last2=Flora|first2=Jan L.|last3=Gasteyer|first3=Stephen P.|date=2015-08-04|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813349718|edition=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field originated primarily from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], and has spread to research how international cities apply this research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701015428|title=The ghetto : contemporary global issues and controversies|last=Ray.|first=Hutchison,|last2=1960-|first2=Haynes, Bruce D.,|date=2012|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813345031|oclc=701015428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The study of cities has changed dramatically from the 1800s over time, with new frames of analysis being applied to the development of urban areas.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"&gt;Robinson, J., 2016. Thinking cities through elsewhere: Comparative tactics for a more global urban studies. Progress in Human Geography, 40(1), pp.3-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The first college programs were created to observe how cities were developed based off anthropological research of ghetto communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2Y5DQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=anthropological+urban+studies+1800's+Europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|last=Birx|first=H. James|date=2005-12-08|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761930297|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1900s, urban study programs expanded beyond just looking at the current and historical impacts of city design and began studying how those designs impacted the future interactions of people and how to improve city development through architecture, open spaces, the interactions of people, and different types of capital that forms a community.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Urban history]] plays an important role in this field of study because it reveals how cities have developed previously.&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Harris|first1= Richard|last2= Smith|first2= Michael E.|date= 2011|title= THE HISTORY IN URBAN STUDIES: A COMMENT|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x/abstract|journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; History plays a large role in determining how cities will change in the future. Such areas change continuously as part of larger processes and create new histories that researchers study on both large-scale and individual levels.&lt;ref name="The New Urban History"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hersberg|first1= Theodore|date= 1978|title= The New Urban History: Toward an Interdisciplinary History of the City|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009614427800500101|journal= Journal of Urban History|volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 3–40|doi= 10.1177/009614427800500101|access-date= May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, three different themes&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paddison |first=Ronan |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Studying Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} have influenced how researchers have and will continue to study urban areas:
# Spatial structures: Reflect how the city is physically organized
# Processes that support spatial structure: Question how the city's structure operates
# Normative Analysis: Construct opinions supported by facts to promote better urban planning methods

Scholars have also researched how cities outside of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] have developed, but only to a limited degree. Urban history previously focused mostly on how European and American cities developed over time, instead of focusing on how non-European cities developed.&lt;ref name="A decade of Urban History: Ashgate's Historical Urban Studies series"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Doyle|first1= Barry M.|date= 2009|title= A decade of urban history: Ashgate’s Historical Urban Studies series|url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/urban-history/article/a-decade-of-urban-history-ashgates-historical-urban-studies-series/F9AC32550D106168CCDAF52861F9E1BB|journal= Urban History|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 498–512|doi= 10.1017/S0963926809990149|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional geographic areas researched in this field include [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Parnell|first1= Susan|date= 1997|title= South African Cities: Perspectives from the Ivory Tower of Urban Studies|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0042098975871?journalCode=usja|journal= Urban Studies|volume= 34|issue= 5-6|pages= 891–906|doi= 10.1080/0042098975871|access-date= April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Huxley|first1= Margo|last2= Loughlin|first2= J.

Racial history in the United States

The [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] of urban residents in the United States has played an important role in developing this field. One program founded to research African-American urban residents, the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]], was founded in 1959 to study [[Racial segregation in the United States#Residential Segregation|residential segregation]] and to support affected communities.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geary |first=Daniel |date=2015 |chapter= Chapter 4: The Death of White Sociology |title=The Moynihan Report and its Legacy |location= Philadelphia, PA|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=110–138 | isbn= 9780812247312}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, studies related to race and urban life started to focus on [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]] to study how individuals lived in relation to the city and their respective systems as a whole.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities" /&gt;

[[Israel Zangwill]] wrote one of the first books on the Ghetto's of Europe and how they impacted the Jewish children that were descendants of the original residents, ''Children of the Ghetto''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''(1892),'' he also wrote two other books about the European Ghettos. [[Louis Wirth]] was the next scholar to write about the Ghettos, he wrote about them from a sociological perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Louis Wirth and [[Robert Ezra Park|Roberts Ezra Park]] also became the first sociologists to publish about the immigrant neighborhoods in America with suggestions on their future design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roberts Ezra Park was the student of George Zimmel who studied the "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]" in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other famous scholars that studied segregation, American Ghettos, and impoverished neighborhoods include [[W.

This field is [[transdisciplinary]] because it uses theories from a variety of academic fields and places them within an urban context.&lt;ref name="Transdisciplinarity and its challenges"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ramadier|first1= Thierry|date= 2004|title= Transdisciplinarity and its challenges: the case of urban studies|url= |journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1016/j.futures.2003.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of academic fields refers to the urban environment as a location studied, such as [[Environmental Studies]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]],&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"/&gt; [[Public Health]], and [[Sociology]].&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"/&gt; However, scholars in this field research how specific elements contribute to how the city operates, such as how [[housing]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Housing"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1= Ray |last2= Williams|first2= Peter|date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Housing in the Twentieth Century |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=88–101 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[transportation]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Transportation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Tom |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Transport and the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=102–123 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; will change. In addition, researchers also study how residents interact within the city, such as how [[Racism in the United States|race]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Race Relations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Darden |first=Joe T. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Race Relations in the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociology of gender|gender]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Gender"&gt;{{cite book |last=McDowell |first=Linda M. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Women, Men, Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=206–219 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; differences lead to [[Social inequality|social inequalities]], or concentrated disadvantage in urban areas.

==Criticism==

In the [[United States]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] has heavily impacted where African-Americans live. [[Black power movement|Black Power movements]], particularly the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], have criticized how the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]] researched the African-American urban population but did not understand the community's needs.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"/&gt;

Researchers also struggle with how terms are created and used both inside and outside the field. Researchers even struggle how to define basic terms precisely, such as how a [[city]] is defined, due to how the roles of cities change.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Defining City"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frey |first=William H. |last2=Zimmer| first2=Zachary |date=2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter=Defining the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers must be careful in how they describe urban areas, as their work can be manipulated as positive elements for [[boosterism|city boosters]] wanting to promote a specific city.&lt;ref name="Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brenner|first1= Neil  |date= 2003|title= Stereotypes, Archetypes, and Prototypes: Three Uses of Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6040.00051/abstract|journal= City &amp; Community|volume= 2|issue= 3|pages= 205–216|doi= 10.1111/1540-6040.00051|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Villa Medici a Fiesole 1.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] with early terraced hillside [[landscape]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]]]
A '''villa''' was originally an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[upper-class]] country house. Since its origins in the [[Roman villa]], the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably.  After the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in [[Late Antiquity]], sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a [[monastery]]. Then they gradually re-evolved through the [[Middle Ages]] into elegant upper-class country homes.  In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, ranging from the [[suburb]]an [[semi-detached]] double villa to residences in the [[wildland–urban interface]].

==Roman==
[[File:060807-002-GettyVilla001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Getty Villa]], an adaptation of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]]]]{{Main|Roman villa}}

* the ''villa urbana'', a country seat that could easily be reached from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] or another city for a night or two
* the ''[[villa rustica]]'', the farm-house estate that was permanently occupied by the servants who had charge generally of the estate, which would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied. The Roman ''villae rusticae'' at the heart of ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' were the earliest versions of what later and elsewhere became called [[plantation]]s.

Not included as ''villae'' were the ''[[domus]]'', a city house for the élite and privileged classes; and ''[[Insula (building)|insulae]]'', blocks of [[apartment building]]s for the rest of the population. In ''[[Satyricon]]'' (1st century CE), [[Petronius]] described the wide range of Roman dwellings. Another type of villae is the "villa marittima", a seaside villa, located on the coast.

A concentration of Imperial villas existed on the [[Gulf of Naples]], on the Isle of [[Capri]], at [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and at Antium ([[Anzio]]). Examples include the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]]; and the "[[Villa of the Mysteries]]" and "[[House of the Vettii|Villa of the Vettii]]" in [[Pompeii]].

Wealthy Romans also escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Tibur ([[Tivoand]] [[Frascati]], such as at [[Hadrian's Villa]]. [[Cicero]] allegedly possessed no fewer than seven villas, the oldest of which was near [[Arpino|Arpinum]], which he inherited. [[Pliny the Younger]] had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.

Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their ''latifundium'' villas, where they drank their own [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and pressed their own [[Olive oil#History|oil]]. This was an affectation of urban aristocrats playing at being old-fashioned virtuous Roman farmers, it has been said that the economic independence of later rural villas was a symptom of the increasing economic fragmentation of the [[Roman Empire]].

===In Roman Britannia===
{{See also|List of Roman villas in England}}

Archaeologists have meticulously examined numerous [[Roman villa]]s in England.&lt;ref&gt;
[[List of Roman villas in England]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Italian counterparts, they were complete working agrarian societies of fields and [[vineyard]]s, perhaps even [[tile]]works or [[Quarry|quarries]], ranged round a high-status power centre with its baths and gardens. The grand villa at [[Woodchester]] preserved its [[mosaic]] floors when the [[Anglo-Saxon]] parish church was built (not by chance) upon its site. Grave-diggers preparing for burials in the churchyard as late as the 18th century had to punch through the intact mosaic floors. The even more palatial ''villa rustica'' at [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Fishbourne]] near [[Winchester]] was built (uncharacteristically) as a large open rectangle, with [[portico]]s enclosing gardens entered through a portico. Towards the end of the 3rd century, Roman towns in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] ceased to expand: like patricians near the centre of the empire, Roman Britons withdrew from the cities to their villas, which entered on a palatial building phase, a "golden age" of villa life. ''Villae rusticae'' are essential in the Empire's economy.

[[File:Fishbourne model.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Model of [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], a governor's villa on the grandest scale]]

Two kinds of villa-plan in Roman Britain may be characteristic of Roman villas in general. The more usual plan extended wings of rooms all opening onto a linking portico, which might be extended at right angles, even to enclose a [[courtyard]]. The other kind featured an aisled central hall like a [[basilica]], suggesting the villa owner's magisterial role. The villa buildings were often independent structures linked by their enclosed courtyards. [[Timber framing|Timber-framed]] construction, carefully fitted with [[Mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]] and [[dowel]]led together, set on stone footings, were the rule, replaced by stone buildings for the important ceremonial rooms. Traces of window [[Roman glass|glass]] have been found, as well as ironwork window [[grille]]s.

===Monastery villas of Late Antiquity===
With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline and collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the fourth and fifth centuries, the villas were more and more isolated and came to be protected by walls. In England the villas were abandoned, [[Looting|looted]], and burned by [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders in the fifth century. But the concept of an isolated, self-sufficient agrarian working community, housed close together, survived into Anglo-Saxon culture as the ''[[vill]]'', with its inhabitants - if formally bound to the land - as ''[[villein]]s''.

In regions on the Continent, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and territorial magnates donated large working villas and overgrown abandoned ones to individual [[monk]]s; these might become the nuclei of [[Monastery|monasteries]]. In this way, the Italian villa system of [[late Antiquity]] survived into the [[early Medieval]] period in the form of monasteries that withstood the disruptions of the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the [[Lombards]]. About 529 [[Benedict of Nursia]] established his influential monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] in the ruins of a villa at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]] that had belonged to [[Nero]].

From the sixth to the eighth century, [[Gallo-Roman]] villas in the [[Merovingian]] royal [[fisc]] were repeatedly donated as sites for monasteries under royal patronage in [[Gaul]] - [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] and [[Fleury Abbey]] provide examples. In Germany a famous example is [[Echternach]]; as late as 698, [[Willibrord]] established an abbey at a Roman villa of Echternach near [[Trier]], presented to him by [[Adela and Irmina|Irmina]], daughter of [[Dagobert II]], king of the [[Franks]]. [[Kintzheim]] was ''Villa Regis'', the "villa of the king". Around 590, [[Saint Eligius]] was born in a highly placed [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] family at the 'villa' of Chaptelat near [[Limoges]], in [[Aquitaine]] (now France). The [[abbey]] at [[Stavelot]] was founded ca 650 on the domain of a former villa near [[Liège]] and the abbey of [[Vézelay]] had a similar founding.

==Post-Roman era==
In post-Roman times a ''villa'' referred to a self-sufficient, usually fortified Italian or [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] farmstead. It was economically as self-sufficient as a ''[[village]]'' and its inhabitants, who might be legally tied to it as [[serfs]] were ''[[villein]]s''. The [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] inherited the concept, followed by the Carolingian French but the later French term was ''basti'' or ''bastide.''

''Villa''/''Vila'' (or its cognates) is part of many Spanish and Portuguese placenames, like [[Vila Real (disambiguation)|Vila Real]] and [[Villadiego]]: a ''villa''/''vila'' is a town with a [[charter]] (''[[fuero]]'' or ''[[foral]]'') of lesser importance than a ''ciudad''/''cidade'' ("city"). When it is associated with a personal name, ''villa'' was probably used in the original sense of a country estate rather than a chartered town. Later evolution has made the Hispanic distinction between ''villas'' and ''ciudades'' a purely honorific one. [[Madrid]] is the ''Villa y [[Court|Corte]]'', the villa considered to be separate from the formerly mobile [[Noble court|royal court]], but the much smaller [[Ciudad Real]] was declared ''ciudad'' by the Spanish crown.

==Italian Renaissance==

===Tuscany===

[[Image:Villa Medicea di Poggio.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|The Villa di Medici by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]]-1470: [[Poggio a Caiano]], [[Tuscany]]]]

In 14th and 15th century Italy, a ''villa'' once more connoted a country house, like the first [[Medici villas]], the [[Villa del Trebbio]] and that at [[Cafaggiolo]], both strong fortified houses built in the 14th century in the [[Mugello region]] near [[Florence]]. In 1450 [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]] commenced on a hillside the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]], [[Tuscany]], probably the first villa created under the instructions of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who theorized the features of the new idea of villa in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]''.

[[Image:Pratolino utens.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Villa di Pratolino]] with lower half of the gardens: by [[Giusto Utens]]-1599. Museo Topografico, [[Florence]].]]These first examples of [[Renaissance]] villa predate the age of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who added the [[Poggio a Caiano#The Medici villa|Villa di Poggio a Caiano]] by [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], begun in 1470, in [[Poggio a Caiano]], [[Province of Prato]], [[Tuscany]].

From Tuscany the idea of ''villa'' was spread again through [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] and Europe.

====Tuscan villa gardens====
The Quattrocento villa gardens were treated as a fundamental and aesthetic link between a residential building and the outdoors, with views over a humanized agricultural [[landscape]], at that time the only desirable aspect of ''[[nature]]''.  Later villas and gardens include the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and [[Boboli Gardens]], Florence; the [[Pienza#Palazzo Piccolomini|Villa di Pratolino]], [[Province of Siena]].

===Rome===
[[File:Villa Doria Pamphili giardini.JPG|250px|thumbnail|[[Villa Doria Pamphili]], Rome]]
Rome had more than its share of villas with easy reach of the small sixteenth-century city: the progenitor, the first ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' built since Antiquity, was the [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]] or ''palazzetto'', designed by [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] and built on the slope above the [[Vatican Palace]].

The [[Villa Madama]], the design of which, attributed to Raphael and carried out by [[Giulio Romano]] in 1520, was one of the most influential private houses ever built; elements derived from Villa Madama appeared in villas through the 19th century. [[Villa Albani]] was built near the Porta Salaria. Other are the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]]; the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] (1650); the [[Villa Giulia]] of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550), designed by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]].  The Roman villas [[Villa Ludovisi]] and Villa Montalto, were destroyed during the late nineteenth century in the wake of the [[real estate bubble]] that took place in Rome after the seat of government of a united Italy was established at Rome.

The cool hills of [[Frascati]] gained the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] (1592); the [[Villa Falconieri]] and the [[Villa Mondragone]].  The [[Villa d'Este]] near [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] is famous for the water play in its terraced [[History of gardens|gardens]]. The [[Villa Medici]] was on the edge of Rome, on the [[Pincian Hill]], when it was built in 1540.  Besides these designed for seasonal pleasure, usually located within easy distance of a city, other Italian villas were remade from a ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]'' or castello, as the family seat of power, such as [[Villa Caprarola]] for the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]].

Near [[Siena]] in Tuscany, the [[Villa Cetinale]] was built by Cardinal [[Flavio Chigi (1631-1693)|Flavio Chigi]]. He employed [[Carlo Fontana]], pupil of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] to transform the villa and dramatic gardens in a [[Roman Baroque]] style by 1680. The [[Villa Lante]] garden is one of the most sublime creations of the Italian villa in the landscape, completed in the 17th century.

=== Venice===

{{Main|Palladian architecture|Palladian villas of the Veneto}}
In the later 16th century in the northeastern [[Italian Peninsula]] the [[Palladian villas of the Veneto]], designed by [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), were built in [[Vicenza]] in the [[Republic of Venice]]. Palladio always designed his villas with reference to their setting. He often unified all the farm buildings into the architecture of his extended villas. Examples are the [[Villa Emo]], the [[Villa Godi]], the [[Villa Forni Cerato]], the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"]], and [[Villa Foscari]].

The Villas are grouped into an association (Associazione Ville Venete) and offer touristic itineraries and accommodation possibilities.

==Villas abroad==

===17th century===
Soon after in [[Greenwich]] England, following his 1613&amp;ndash;1615 [[Grand Tour]], [[Inigo Jones]] designed and built the [[Queen's House]] between 1615&amp;ndash;1617 in an early [[Palladian architecture]] style adaptation in another country. The Palladian villa style renewed its influence in different countries and eras and remained influential for over four hundred years, with the [[Neo-Palladian]] a part of the late 17th century and on [[Renaissance Revival architecture]] period.

[[File:Baederarchitektur-Binz 1658.jpg|thumb|Villa "Sea Greeting" (Meeresgruss) in [[Binz]], [[Rügen|Rügen Island]] - a typical villa in 19th-century German [[resort architecture]] style]]

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the early 18th century the English took up the term, and applied it to compact houses in the country,&lt;ref&gt;These are not to be confused with the [[English country house]]s, which were centres of political and cultural power and show surrounded by the estates that supported them, such as [[Holkham Hall]], [[Alnwick Castle]] or [[Woburn Abbey]]; in Ireland [[Castletown House]] and  [[Russborough House]] are comparable examples.&lt;/ref&gt; especially those accessible from London: [[Chiswick House]] is an example of such a "party villa". Thanks to the revival of interest in Palladio and [[Inigo Jones]], soon [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival|Neo-Palladian]] villas dotted the valley of the [[River Thames]] and English countryside. [[Marble Hill House]] in England was conceived originally as a "villa" in the 18th-century sense.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Summerson]], ''Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830'': ch. 22 "Palladian permeation: the villa" provides a standard overview of the building type.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways the late 18th century [[Monticello]], by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in [[Virginia]], United States is a [[Palladian Revival]] villa. Other examples of the period and style are [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]; and many pre-[[American Civil War]] or Antebellum [[Plantations]], such as [[Westover Plantation]] and many other [[List of James River plantations|James River plantations]] as well dozens of [[Antebellum architecture|Antebellum era plantations]] in the rest of the [[Old South]] functioned as the Roman [[Latifundium]] villas had.  A later revival, in the [[Gilded Age]] and early 20th century, produced [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], [[Filoli]] in [[Woodside, California]], and [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]; by architects-landscape architects such as [[Richard Morris Hunt]], [[Willis Polk]], and [[Beatrix Farrand]].

In the nineteenth century, ''villa'' was extended to describe any large [[suburb]]an house that was free-standing in a [[landscape]]d plot of ground. By the time 'semi-detached villas' were being erected at the turn of the twentieth century, the term collapsed under its extension and overuse.

The second half of the nineteenth century saw the creation of large "Villenkolonien" in the German speaking countries, wealthy residential areas that were completely made up of large mansion houses and often built to an artfully created masterplan. Also many large mansions for the wealthy German industrialists were built, such as [[Villa Hügel]] in [[Essen]]. The Villenkolonie of [[Lichterfelde West]] in Berlin was conceived after an extended trip by the architect through the South of England.
Representative [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] mansions in Germany include the [[Heiligendamm]] and other [[resort architecture]] mansions at the Baltic Sea, [[Rose Island (Lake Starnberg)|Rose Island]] and [[King's House on Schachen]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]], [[Villa Dessauer]] in [[Bamberg]], [[Wahnfried|Villa Wahnfried]] in [[Bayreuth]], [[Schloss Drachenburg|Drachenburg]] near [[Bonn]], [[Hammerschmidt Villa]] in [[Bonn]], the [[Liebermann Villa]] and [[Schloss Britz|Britz House]] in Berlin, [[Albrechtsberg Palace (Dresden)|Albrechtsberg]], ''Eckberg'', ''Villa Stockhausen'' and [[:de:Villa San Remo|Villa San Remo]] in [[Dresden]], [[:de:Künstlerhaus Villa Waldberta|Villa Waldberta]] in [[Feldafing]], [[:de:Villa Kennedy|Villa Kennedy]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[Jenisch House]] and [[Budge-Palais]] in [[Hamburg]], [[:de:Villa Andreae|Villa Andreae]] and [[:de:Villa Rothschild|Villa Rothschild]] in [[Königstein im Taunus|Königstein]], [[Villa Stuck]] and [[:de:Pacelli-Palais|Pacelli-Palais]] in [[Munich]], [[Schloss Klink]] at [[Müritz|Lake Müritz]], [[Villa Ludwigshöhe]] in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Villa Haux]] in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Weinberg House (Waren)|Weinberg House]] in [[Waren (Müritz)|Waren]].

In France the [[Château de Ferrières]] is an example of the Italian [[Neo-Renaissance]] style villa - and in Britain the [[Mentmore Towers]] by [[John Ruskin]]. A representative building of this style in Germany is [[Villa Haas]] (designed by Ludwig Hofmann) in [[Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus F. Müller: Park und Villa Haas - Historismus, Kunst und Lebensstil.

===20th - 21st centuries===

====Europe====
[[File:Villenanlage OID 69016.jpg|thumb|Typical Villa in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]]]
During the 19th and 20th century, the term "villa" became widespread for detached mansions in Europe. Special forms are for instance [[Spa architecture|spa villas]] (''Kurvillen'' in German) and [[Resort architecture|seaside villas]] (''Bädervillen'' in German), that became especially popular at the end of the 19th century. The tradition established back then continued throughout the 20th century and even until today.

Another trend was the erection of rather minimalist mansions in the [[Bauhaus]] style since the 1920s, that also continues until today.

In Denmark, Norway and Sweden "villa" denotes most forms of [[single-family detached home]]s, regardless of size and standard.

====Americas====
The villa concept lived and lives on in the [[hacienda]]s of Latin America and the [[estancia]]s of Brazil and Argentina. The oldest are original Portuguese and [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]; followed after independences in the Americas from Spain and Portugal, by the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style with regional variations. In the 20th century [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] villas were designed by [[Roberto Burle Marx]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Luis Barragán]], and other architects developing a unique Euro-Latin synthesized aesthetic.

Villas are particularly well represented in [[California]] and the West Coast of the United States, where they were originally commissioned by well travelled "upper-class" patrons moving on from the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] [[Victorian architecture]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]. Communities such as [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] in Southern California, and [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] and [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] are a few examples of villa density.

The popularity of [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]] in its various iterations over the last century has been consistently used in that region and in [[Florida]]. Just a few of the notable early architects were [[Wallace Neff]], [[Addison Mizner]], [[Stanford White]], and [[George Washington Smith (architect)|George Washington Smith]]. A few examples are the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Medici scale [[Hearst Castle]] on the [[Central Coast of California]], and [[Villa Montalvo]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] of [[Saratoga, California]], [[Villa Vizcaya]] in [[Coconut Grove, Miami]], [[American Craftsman]] versions are the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and the villas by [[Greene and Greene]] in [[Pasadena, California]]

====Other====
Today the term "villa" is often applied to [[vacation rental]] properties. In the United Kingdom the term is used for high quality detached homes in warm destinations, particularly [[Florida]] and the Mediterranean.  The term is also used in Pakistan, and in some of the Caribbean islands such as [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[British Virgin Islands]], and others. It is similar for the coastal resort areas of [[Baja California Sur]] and mainland Mexico, and for [[hospitality industry]] [[destination resort]] "luxury [[bungalow]]s" in various worldwide locations.

In Indonesia, the term "villa" is applied to Dutch colonial country houses (''landhuis''). Nowadays, the term is more popularly applied to vacation rental usually located in countryside area.

[[Image:Heritage Houses In Freemans Bay.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Heritage villas: late 19th century, [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]In Australia "villas" or "villa units" are terms used to describe a type of [[townhouse]] complex which contains, possibly smaller attached or detached houses of up to 3-4 bedrooms that were built since the early 1980s.

In New Zealand the term "villa" is commonly used to describe a style of wooden [[weatherboard]] house constructed before WW1 characterised by high ceilings (often 12&amp;nbsp;ft), [[sash window]]s, and a long entrance hall.

In Cambodia "villa" is used as a loanword in the local language of Khmer, and is generally used to describe any type of detached townhouse that features yard space. The term doesn't apply to any particular architectural style or size, the only features that distinguish a Khmer villa from another building are the yard space and being fully detached. The terms "twin-villa" and "mini-villa" have been coined meaning semi-detached and smaller versions respectively. Generally, these would be more luxurious and spacious houses than the more common row houses. The yard space would also typically feature some form of garden, trees or greenery. Generally, these would be properties in major cities, where there is more wealth and hence more luxurious houses.
