      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15074">'''Advanced oxidation processes''' (abbreviation: '''AOPs'''), in a broad sense, are a set of chemical treatment procedures designed to remove organic (and sometimes inorganic) materials in [[water]] and [[wastewater]] by [[oxidation]] through reactions with [[hydroxyl radicals]] (·OH).&lt;ref name="glaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glaze|first=William|author2=Kang, Joon-Wun|author3= Chapin, Douglas H.|title=The Chemistry of Water Treatment Processes Involving Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide and Ultraviolet Radiation.|journal=Ozone: Science &amp; Engineering |year=1987|volume=9|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1080/01919518708552148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world applications of [[wastewater treatment]], however, this term usually refers more specifically to a subset of such chemical processes that employ [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and/or UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Water Research Institute|title=Treatment Technologies for Removal of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) from Drinking Water: Chapter III Advanced Oxidation Processes|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such type of process is  called [[in situ oxidation|in situ chemical oxidation]].

==Description==
AOPs rely on in-situ production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH). These reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and can virtually oxidize any compound present in the water matrix, often at a diffusion controlled reaction speed. Consequently, ·OH reacts unselectively once formed and contaminants will be quickly and efficiently fragmented and converted into small inorganic molecules. Hydroxyl radicals are produced with the help of one or more primary oxidants (e.g. [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[oxygen]]) and/or energy sources (e.g. [[ultraviolet]] light) or catalysts (e.g. [[titanium dioxide]]). Precise, pre-programmed dosages, sequences and combinations of these reagents are applied in order to obtain a maximum •OH yield. In general, when applied in properly tuned conditions, AOPs can reduce the concentration of contaminants from several-hundreds [[Parts per million|ppm]] to less than 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and therefore significantly bring [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Total organic carbon|TOC]] down, which earned it the credit of “water treatment processes of the 21st century”.&lt;ref name="munter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munter|first=Rein|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes–Current Status and Prospects.|journal=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Chemistry|year=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOP procedure is particularly useful for cleaning biologically toxic or non-degradable materials such as [[aromatics]], [[pesticides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Misra|first=N.N.|title=The contribution of non-thermal and advanced oxidation technologies towards dissipation of pesticide residues|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=2|pages=229–244|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2015.06.005|year=2015|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=schfsehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[petroleum]] constituents, and [[volatile organic compound]]s in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Enric Brillasa |author2=Eva Mur |author3=Roser Sauleda |author4=Laura Sànchez |author5=José Peral |author6=Xavier Domènech |author7=Juan Casado |title=Aniline mineralization by AOP's: anodic oxidation, photocatalysis, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |date=March 1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1016/S0926-3373(97)00059-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TF6-3VN03K2-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d557b71411fdce56af991813ef191bf7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, AOPs can be used to treat effluent of secondary treated wastewater which is then called [[tertiary treatment]].&lt;ref name="audenaert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.T.M.

A goal of the wastewater purification by means of AOP procedures is the reduction of the chemical contaminants and the toxicity to such an extent that the cleaned wastewater may be reintroduced into receiving streams or, at least, into a conventional [[sewage treatment]].

Although oxidation processes involving ·OH have been in use since late 19th century (such as in Fenton reagent, which, however, was an analytical reagent at that time), the utilization of such oxidative species in water treatment did not receive adequate attention until Glaze et al.&lt;ref name="glaze"/&gt;  suggested the possible generation of ·OH “in sufficient quantity to affect water purification” and defined the term “Advanced Oxidation Processes” for the first time in 1987. AOPs still have not been put into commercial use on a large scale (especially in developing countries) even up to today mostly because of the relatively high costs. Nevertheless, its high oxidative capability and efficiency make AOPs a popular technique in tertiary treatment in which the most recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants are to be eliminated. The increasing interest in water reuse and more stringent regulations regarding water pollution are currently accelerating the implementation of AOPs at full-scale.
There are roughly 500 commercialized AOPs installations around the world at present, mostly in [[Europe]] and [[the United States]]. Other countries like [[China]] are showing increasing interests in AOPs.

==Chemical principles==
Generally speaking, chemistry in AOPs could be essentially divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazille |first=Félicien |title=Advanced Oxidation Processes {{!}} SSWM. Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management |url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528100827/http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Formation of ·OH;
# Initial attacks on target molecules by ·OH and their breakdown to fragments;
# Subsequent attacks by ·OH until ultimate [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].
The mechanism of ·OH production (Part 1) highly depends on the sort of AOP technique that is used. For example, ozonation, UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and photocatalytic oxidation rely on different mechanisms of ·OH generation:
*UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="audenaert" /&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → 2·OH ''(homolytic bond cleavage of the O-O bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to formation of 2·OH radicals)''

:O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(reaction between O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a hydroxyl ion leads to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (in charged form))''

:HO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;· → ·OH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''
*Photocatalytic oxidation with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="beltran" /&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(irradiation of the photocatalytic surface leads to an excited [[electron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and electron gap (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)''
:Ti(IV) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(water adsorbs onto the catalyst surface)''
:Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}}  Ti(IV)-·OH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''the highly reactive electron gap will react with water''
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''

Currently there is no consensus on the detailed mechanisms in Part 3, but researchers have cast light on the processes of initial attacks in Part 2. In essence, ·OH is a radical species and should behave like a highly reactive electrophile. Thus two type of initial attacks are supposed to be [[Hydrogen Abstraction]] and [[Addition reaction|Addition]]. The following scheme, adopted from a technical handbook and later refined, describes a possible mechanism of the oxidation of [[benzene]] by ·OH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solarchem Environmental System|title=The UV/Oxidation Handbook|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Mechanism of OH with benzene.png|800px|Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals]]

''Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals''

The first and second steps are electrophilic addition that breaks the aromatic ring in benzene (A) and forms two hydroxyl groups (–OH) in intermediate C. Later an ·OH grabs a hydrogen atom in one of the hydroxyl groups, producing a radical species (D) that is prone to undergo rearrangement to form a more stable radical (E). E, on the other hand, is readily attacked by ·OH and eventually forms 2,4-hexadiene-1,6-dione (F).
As long as there are sufficient ·OH radicals, subsequent attacks on compound F will continue until the fragments are all converted into small and stable molecules like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the end, but such processes may still be subject to a myriad of possible and partially unknown mechanisms.

==Advantages==
AOPs hold several advantages that are unparalleled in the field of water treatment:
*They can effectively eliminate organic compounds in aqueous phase, rather than collecting or transferring pollutants into another phase.
*Due to the remarkable reactivity of ·OH, it virtually reacts with almost every aqueous pollutant without discriminating. AOPs are therefore applicable in many, if not all, scenarios where many organic contaminants must be removed at the same time.
*Some [[heavy metals]] can also be removed in forms of precipitated M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.
*In some AOPs designs, [[disinfection]] can also be achieved, which makes these AOPs an integrated solution to some water quality problems.
*Since the complete reduction product of ·OH is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, AOPs theoretically do not introduce any new hazardous substances into the water.

==Current shortcomings==
It should be realised that AOPs are not perfect and have several drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes|url=http://neopuretech.com/advanced-oxidation-processes/|publisher=Neopure Technologies|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most prominently, the cost of AOPs is fairly high, since a continuous input of expensive chemical reagents is required to maintain the operation of most AOP systems. As a result of their very nature, AOPs require hydroxyl radicals and other reagents proportional to the quantity of contaminants to be removed.
*Some techniques require pre-treatment of wastewater to ensure reliable performance, which could be potentially costly and technically demanding. For instance, presence of [[bicarbonate]] ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can appreciably reduce the concentration of ·OH due to [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging processes]] that yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a much less reactive species, ·CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="munter"/&gt; As a result, bicarbonate must be wiped out from the system or AOPs are compromised.
*It is not cost effective to use solely AOPs to handle a large amount of wastewater; instead, AOPs should be deployed in the final stage after [[primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] have successfully removed a large proportion of contaminants.

==Future ==
Since AOPs were first defined in 1987, the field has witnessed a rapid development both in theory and in application. So far, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, and Fenton, photo-Fenton and Electro-Fenton systems have received extensive scrutiny. However, there are still many research needs on these existing AOPs.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

Recent trends are the development of new, modified AOPs that are efficient and economical. In fact, there has been some studies that offer constructive solutions. For instance, [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with non-metallic elements could possibly enhance the [[photocatalytic]] activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Tracy L|author2=Yates, John T|title=Surface science studies of the photoactivation of TiO2–new photochemical processes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2006|volume=106|issue=10|pages=4428–4453|doi=10.1021/cr050172k|pmid=17031993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementation of ultrasonic treatment could promote the production of hydroxyl radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berberidou|first=C|author2=Poulios I.|author3= Xekoukoulotakis, N.

{{broader|Agricultural science}}
'''Animal Science''' (also '''Animal [[Bioscience]]''') is described as "studying the [[biology]] of [[animal]]s that are under the control of humankind." It can also be described as the production and management of farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/Study/Departments/ug-AnimalScience.asp
 | title = Animal Science
 | work = University of Reading
 | accessdate = 2009-04-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the degree was called [[animal husbandry]] and the animals studied were [[livestock]] species, like [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s,  [[poultry]], and [[horse]]s. Today, courses available now look at a far broader area to include companion animals like [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, and many exotic species. Degrees in Animal Science are offered at a number of colleges and universities. Typically, the Animal Science curriculum not only provides a strong science background, but also hands-on experience working with animals on campus-based farms. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Education ==
Professional education in animal science prepares students for career opportunities in areas such as animal breeding, food and fiber production, nutrition, animal [[agribusiness]], animal behavior and welfare. Courses in a typical Animal Science program may include genetics, microbiology, animal behavior, nutrition, physiology, and reproduction. Courses in support areas, such as genetics, soils, agricultural economics and marketing, legal aspects, and the environment also are offered. All of these courses are essential to entering an animal science profession.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Bachelor degree ===
At many universities, a [[Bachelor of Science]] (BS) degree in Animal Science allows emphasis in certain areas. Typical areas are species-specific or career-specific. Species-specific areas of emphasis prepare students for a career in [[dairy]] management, [[beef]] management, [[swine]] management, [[sheep]] or small ruminant management, [[poultry]] production, or the [[horse]] industry. Other career-specific areas of study include pre-veterinary medicine studies, livestock business and marketing, animal welfare and behavior, animal nutrition science, animal reproduction science, or genetics. Youth programs are also an important part of animal science programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animalscience.unl.edu/aboutansc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612044227/http://animalscience.unl.edu/aboutansc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-12 |title=About Animal Science |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |accessdate=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-veterinary emphasis ====
Many schools that offer a degree option in Animal Science also offer a pre-veterinary emphasis such as [[ Iowa State University]], the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], for example.  This option provides an in-depth knowledge base of the biological and physical sciences including nutrition, reproduction, physiology, and genetics. This can prepare students for graduate studies in animal science, veterinary school, and pharmaceutical or animal science industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansci.umn.edu/education/undergrad_program.htm |title=Department of Animal Science |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022659/http://www.ansci.umn.edu/education/undergrad_program.htm |archivedate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graduate studies ===
In a [[Master of Science]] degree option, students take required courses in areas that support their main interest. These courses are above courses normally required for a Bachelor of Science degree in the Animal Science major. For example, in a Ph.D. degree program students take courses related to their major that are more in-depth than those for the Master of Science degree, with an emphasis on research or teaching.

Graduate studies in animal sciences are considered preparation for upper-level positions in production, management, education, research, or agriservices. Professional study in veterinary medicine, law, and business administration are among the most commonly chosen programs by graduates. Other areas of study include growth biology, physiology, nutrition, and production systems.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">'''Biomimetic antifouling coating'''s are special coatings that prevent the accumulation of marine organisms on a surface.  Typical antifouling coatings are not [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] but are based on synthetic [[chemical compound]]s that can have deleterious effects on the environment.  Prime examples are [[tributyltin]] compounds, which are components in paints to prevent [[biofouling]] of ship hulls.  Although highly effective at combatting the accumulation of barnacles and other problematic organisms, [[organotin compound|organotin-containing]] paints are damaging to many organisms and have been shown to interrupt marine food chains.&lt;ref&gt;Salta, M., Wharton, J.

==Chemical methods==
Most antifouling coatings are based upon [[chemical compound]]s that inhibit fouling. When incorporated into marine coatings, these [[biocide]]s leech into the immediate surroundings and minimize fouling. The classic synthetic antifouling agent is [[tributyltin]] (TBT).  Natural biocides typically show lower environmental impact but variable effectiveness.

Natural biocides are typically divided into two categories: [[terpenes]] (often containing unsaturated [[ligand]] groups and electronegative oxygen functional groups) and nonterpenes.

Various [[tannins]] (nonterpene), naturally synthesized by a variety of plants, are effective biocides when combined with copper and zinc salts.&lt;ref name=Bellotti&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bellotti |first1=N |last2=Deya|first2=C |last3=del Amo |first3=B |last4=Romagnoli |first4=R |year=2010 |title=Antifouling Paints with Zinc "Tannate" |journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=3386–3390 |doi=10.1021/ie9010518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tannins are able to flocculate with a variety of cations, which then exhibit antiseptic properties. The most effective natural biocide is 3,4-dihydroxybufa-20,22 dienolide, or [[bufalin]] (a steroid of [[bufotoxin|toad poison]] from ''Bufo vulgaris''), which is over 100 times more effective than TBT at preventing biofouling.&lt;ref name=Omae/&gt; Bufalin is however expensive.  A few natural compounds with simpler synthetic routes, such as [[nicotinamide]] or 2,5,6-tribromo-1-methylgramine (from ''Zoobotryon pellucidum''), have been incorporated into patented antifouling paints.&lt;ref name=Omae/&gt;

A significant drawback to biomimetic chemical agents is their modest service life. Since the natural biocides must leech out of the coating to be effective, the rate of leeching is a key parameter.&lt;ref name=leech_rate&gt;{{cite web|title=Emission Scenario Document on Antifouling Products Annex|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/33/37/34707347.pdf|work=Biocides Publications|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \text{Total biocide release} = {  L_\text{a} \times a \times W_\text{a} \times 100 \over\ SVR \times SPG \times DFT}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Where '''L&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the fraction of the biocide actually released (typically around 0.7), '''a''' is the weight fraction of the active ingredient in the biocide, '''DFT''' is the dry film thickness, '''W&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the concentration of the natural biocide in the wet paint, '''SPG''' is the specific gravity of the wet paint, and '''SVR''' is the percentage of dry paint to wet paint by volume.

==Shark skin mimetics==
One class of biomimetic antifouling coatings is inspired by the surface of shark skin, which consists of nanoscale overlapping plates that exhibit parallel ridges that effectively prevent sharks from becoming fouled even when moving at slow speeds.  The antifouling qualities of the shark skin-inspired designs appear highly dependent upon the engineered roughness index (ERI).&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=C|title=A model that predicts the attachment behavior of Ulva linza zoospores on surface topography|journal=Biofouling|year=2010|volume=26|issue=4|pages=411–419|doi=10.1080/08927011003628849|pmid=20191401|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a919515111&amp;fulltext=713240928|accessdate=6 June 2011|last2=Schumacher|first2=James F.|last3=Robinson|first3=Paul A.C.|last4=Finlay|first4=John A.|last5=Callow|first5=Maureen E.|last6=Callow|first6=James A.|last7=Brennan|first7=Anthony B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; ERI = { r \times n \over 1 - \phi}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where '''r''' is the Wenzel roughness ratio, '''n''' is the number of distinct surface features in the design of the surface, and φ is the area fraction of the tops of the distinct surface features. A completely smooth surface would have an ERI = 0.

Using this equation, the amount of microfouling spores per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be modeled.  Similar to actual shark skin, the patterned nature of Sharklet AF shows microstructural differences in three dimensions with a corresponding ERI of 9.5. This three-dimensional patterned difference imparts a 77% reduction in microfouling settlement.&lt;ref name=Schumacher_1/&gt; Other artificial nonpatterned nanoscale rough surfaces such as 2-μm-diameter circular pillars (ERI = 5.0) or 2-μm-wide ridges (ERI = 6.1) reduce fouling settlement by 36% and 31%, respectively, while a more patterned surface composed of 2-μm-diameter circular pillars and 10-μm equilateral triangles (ERI = 8.7) reduces spore settlement by 58%.&lt;ref name=Schumacher_1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schumacher|first=J|title=Engineered antifouling microtopographies - effect of feature size, geometry, and roughness on settlement of zoospores of the green alga Ulva|journal=Biofouling|year=2007|volume=23|issue=1|pages=55–62|doi=10.1080/08927010601136957|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a776600187|accessdate=7 June 2011|last2=Carman|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Estes|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Feinberg|first4=Adam W.|last5=Wilson|first5=Leslie H.|last6=Callow|first6=Maureen E.|last7=Callow|first7=James A.|last8=Finlay|first8=John A.|last9=Brennan|first9=Anthony B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[contact angle]]s obtained for hydrophobic surfaces are directly related to surface roughnesses by the [[Wenzel]] equation.&lt;ref name = Lotus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng |first1=Y |last2=Rodak |first2=D |last3=Wong |first3=C |last4= Hayden|first4=C|title = Effect of micro- and nano-structure on the self-cleaning behaviour of lotus leaves |journal= Nanotechnology| year=2006 |pages=1359–1362 |volume = 17 |issue=5 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/17/5/032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Biomimetic antifouling coatings are highly lucrative because of their low environmental impact and demonstrated success. Some properties of a biomimetic antifouling coating can be predicted from the contact angles obtained from the Wenzel equation, and the calculated ERI. Natural materials such as shark skin continue to provide inspiration for scientists to improve the coatings currently on the market.

==History==
[[File:Dallas_Cowboys_in_the_red-zone.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Dallas Cowboys]] trained at CLU for 27 years.]]
California Lutheran College (CLC) was built in the early 1960s on nearly 300 acres of land in northern [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]]. Most land had been donated by Richard Pederson, the son of [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrants and member of the [[Norwegian Colony (Thousand Oaks)|Norwegian Colony]]. Pederson donated 130 acres, while more was purchased from other ranchers. The original $2.1 million campus first constructed a swimming pool, and soon also dormitories, administrative offices and classrooms. The college first opened in September 1961. It opened with an enrollment of 330 students, and had reached 1400 students by its first ten years. It became fully accredited within its first year. In 1963, the Community Leaders Club was established in order to bring the town and college closer together. The group conducted annual auctions, staged events, assisted athletic programs, etc. Nearly half of its faculty held doctoral degrees by the early 1970s. The college’s largest gift in school history was received from Clifford- and Alma Pearson, who donated $1 million in 1985 which helped establish the Pearson Library. California Lutheran University remained the only four-year university in Ventura County as of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). ''The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers''.

===Background and origins===

[[File:Regals_way_california_lutheran_university.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Regals Way by Kingsmen Park.]]
As far back as the turn of the century, when the first [[Norway|Norwegian]] Lutheran settlers came to the [[Conejo Valley]], they brought the dream of one day establishing a college of their own. Leland Stanford had offered a 50-acre lot near [[Palo Alto, CA]] to Swedish Lutherans, but withdrew their offer when asked to fund the construction. In 1928, a group of [[Los Angeles]] developers gave a 100-acre site in [[Del Rey Hills, Los Angeles|Del Rey Hills]] to the Lutheran church. According to a front page article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the 1929 stock market crash postponed the scheduled construction indefinitely. When World War II ended, the 1944 [[GI Bill of Rights]] made it financially possible for over a million veterans to return to college, doubling and even quadrupling the size of some Lutheran colleges in the United States. At the time, California was home to 16 Protestant- and 12 Roman Catholic colleges, however, Lutherans lacked a four-year college in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Pages 98-99. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Pam (2002). ''Thousand Oaks Westlake Village: A Contemporary Portrait''. Community Communications, Inc. Page 90. {{ISBN|978-1581920611}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee of Twenty-Five grew out of a meeting convened in [[North Hollywood]] on Sept. 13, 1954, led by Dr. Gaylerd Falde, the president of the California District of the Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC). At the committee’s first meeting was Dr. [[Orville Dahl]], executive secretary of the Board of Higher Education of the ELC, who would later become the creative force behind California Lutheran College. In 1957, a charitable foundation known as the California Lutheran Education Foundation (CLEF) was formed by cooperating Lutheran churches for the purpose of gathering funds for a new college. Dr. Orville Dahl was elected director and Dr. Gaylerd Falde became the chairman of its Board of Governors. Dahl and members of the CLEF visited more than fifty sites in search of a location for the new college.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Pages 99-100. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last visit took him 45 miles northwest of Los Angeles to the [[Conejo Valley]], where Dahl was offered land by Norwegian farmer Lawrence Pederson. The price tag was however too high, but Richard Pederson approached Dahl the next day handing him the deed to his 130-acre ranch property. In 1957, Dahl became the president of California Lutheran College. Dahl was convinced without a strong church connection, the school would never become reality. He quickly established an outdoor place of worship and also constructed a swimming pool to “entice congregations to come out to the future campus.”&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 100. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and early years===

California Lutheran College (CLC) opened its doors in the fall of 1961. Church contribution of $400,000 along with individual gifts and loans, had made the completion of a new campus centre possible, which consisted of eight buildings. In addition to those eight, the old [[Pederson House and Water Tower|Pederson House]] and chicken coops were remodeled into classrooms and offices. The new college was planted in a fertile setting, rimmed by rolling hills, and home to Kingsmen Creek. Orange- and walnut groves from the old Pederson Ranch were still seen on campus. The college’s formal dedication was held on Reformation Sunday at the end of October, 1961. A highlight of this service was “[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]” performed by the newly formed college orchestra and choir. 4,000 Lutherans came to witness the service.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 101"&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 101. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the first faculty members were of Lutheran faith, often recruited from other Lutheran colleges. There was an understanding during its first two years that only Lutherans should be hired.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 101"/&gt;

The college was accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges|Western Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] in March 1962. Dahl served as president until 1962, bringing the university's first football coach, Robert Shoup, to the campus in his final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cluecho.com/2014/10/founding-father-of-clu-football-is-being-recognized/ |title=Founding father of CLU football is being recognized |newspaper=The Echo |date=October 8, 2014 |publisher=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Dallas Cowboys]]'' brought their summer training camp to the campus in 1963 and kept it there until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.callutheran.edu/news/story.html?id=12331#story|title=LA Rams training moving to Cal Lutheran|first=California Lutheran|last=University|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 106"&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B.

On February 20, 1967, about 200 students instituted a [[Sit-in|sit-down]] in front the gymnasium while the chapel was in service to protest things that they believed needed to be changed such as the attendance policy, and operating hours of the library, bookstore, and coffee shop — all of which were closed during chapel services. On April 19, 1968, three hundred Cal Lutheran students commemorated the life of assassinated civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] by marching down Moorpark Boulevard in his memory.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.callutheran.edu/about/history/ |title=Our History |website=California Lutheran University |access-date=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another march was held as part of the National [[Vietnam War Moratorium Rally]]. Both marches went from California Lutheran College to downtown Thousand Oaks. President Olson was among those marching with the students and speaking out against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Pages 104-105. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1960s, the WASC Accrediting Committee had expressed concern over an indebtedness in excess of $1,731,000 and a deficit in current funds of over $350,000. President Dr. Olson inherited the debt, and further deficit budgets during his tenure added to the college’s indebtedness. Donations and grants were insufficient to balance the budget, and the Board of Regents complained they had difficulty getting exact amounts on income versus expenditures. In spite of its economic turmoil, the college grew in number of students, academic reputation, and in number of faculty members. In the fall of 1963, the college had 550 students and in 1964 reached a total of 736 students, originating from 24 U.S. states, [[Sweden]] and [[China]]. Although Lutherans still made up a majority of 78%, seventeen other denominations were also represented at the college. The percentage of Lutheran faculty and administration workers was 69 percent. From 1963-66, full-time faculty grew from 38 to 69 persons, where [[Methodists]] and [[Presbyterians]] were the most represented non-Lutheran faculty.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 106"/&gt;

===Early finances===
[[File:California_lutheran_university_clu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Walkway by flagpoles.]]
The school’s total debt reached a staggering $3,600,000 in 1970, and the university was facing [[bankruptcy]]. [[Marine Knutson]], a Lutheran layman who had experience within crisis management, was hired by the national church as a financial troubleshooter for the college. By applying austere measures that included cutting the facility by seven work positions, Knutson managed to end year 1970 with a $80,000 budget surplus, and was also successful in reducing the debt by $800,000 by the end of the year. National church bodies made a guaranteed commitment for a loan of $1,000,000. Dr. Olson resigned as president in May 1971, after eight years as president during a tenure of financial crisis and social upheaval. However, Dr. Olson had tripled the college’s size, and the school was now home of 1,000 students.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 107"&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 107. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the search for a new president failed to produce a candidate from outside campus, the Board of Regents was advised by Knutson to appoint Dr. Mark Mathews, the chair of the Business Administration and Economics Department. As Dr. Mathews was a [[Presbyterian]], the institution’s by-laws had to be changed in order to permit him to hold the office. Dr. Mathews became acting college president in 1972. Under his fiscal management, the college reversed the deficit trend and a longer period of financial stability and growth followed his tenure.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 107"/&gt;

===New expansion===
[[File:Pearson_library_california_lutheran_university.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pearson Library has over 132,000 titles.&lt;ref name="Clemente, Stephen 2009 Page 52"&gt;Clemente, Stephen (2009). ''Peterson's Colleges in the West''. Peterson’s. Page 52. ISBN 9780768926965.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An increased diversity in religious affiliation took place in the 1970s. In the first year of that decade, Lutherans represented 60% of the faculty, but by the 1978-1979 school year made up only 45% of the faculty. That year, “other Christians” for the first time in school history outnumbered Lutherans. Dr. Mathews resigned as president in 1980, and in 1981 Reverend Jerry Miller, a [[Harvard University]] graduate and director of National Lutheran Campus Ministry, became the fourth college president. The fiscal year 1983-1984 recorded grants and donations at $3,250,000, including an individual gift of $1 million, the single largest donation to that date. With the new funds in hand, the school was now able to construct three major buildings: The Pearson Library was erected in 1985, the Ahmanson Science Center in 1988, and the Samuelson Chapel in 1990. The Ahmanson Science Center meant that all sciences for the first time had adequate equipment and space to initiate significant research programs. The new library housed 100,000 books as of 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997).

In 1971, the college football team won the [[NAIA Football National Championship]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997 Page 107"/&gt;

In the early 1980s the college was committed to the establishment of an environment supportive of cultural- and ethnic pluralism. In 1981, the college established four-year working relations with a study group from [[Japan]]. With a peak enrollment of 45 Japanese students, the college was further encouraged by WASC in 1983 to be more multiculturally diverse. The college’s report to WASC in 1988 consisted of a revised mission statement which affirmed that the college is welcome to “students of all ages as well as all cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds.” The school began a determent effort in 1986 based on recruiting international students from [[Scandinavia]], and one year it was seventy international students from [[Norway]] attending the college. Furthermore, a grant from the [[Irvine Foundation]] helped the college recruit and offer financial aid to minorities. The effort became successful and the college soon attracted a significant [[Latino-American]] population from [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]. An Office of Multicultural Services was established to facilitate various ethnic organizations and their events.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 113. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University status===
[[File:Regals_way_california_lutheran_university_clu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Regals Way as seen from Falde Plaza.]]
In the fall of 1985, the Board of Regents agreed with the administration that California Lutheran College was ready to receive [[university]] status. Not all agreed; those opposing the change felt it could mean sacrificing the CLC’s focus on [[liberal arts]]. Some also argued that the college did not have an adequate [[university library]], or that the college in other ways was not ready. Those favoring the change noted that CLC already had graduate programs at the master’s level in five distinct areas, and also noted that despite being the only four-year college in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], CLC kept being compared to the state’s two-year community colleges. Some were persuaded that turning into a university would force the administrators to take more seriously the scholarly quests for academic excellence. On January 1, 1986, the college became California Lutheran University (CLU).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997).

==Residence life==
[[File:Aebleskiver_at_Cal_Lutheran_Scandanavian_Festival.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Aebleskiver]] at the annual Scandinavian Festival.]]
California Lutheran University maintains a policy of guaranteeing on-campus housing for all four years if students elect to do so. On-campus housing or living at home is required for freshmen and sophomores; however, juniors and seniors may elect to live off-campus with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.callutheran.edu/student_life/res_life/ |title=Residence Life |website=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt; 63% of the student body reside on campus as of 2011, while 88% of all freshmen students reside on campus.&lt;ref name="Rubinoff 2010 Page 141"/&gt;

===Upperclassmen housing===
Once students move on to their sophomore, junior and senior years at CLU, they are allowed to choose which residence hall to live in on the west side of campus. This area contains the New West Complex (comprising four buildings: North, South, West, and Potenberg halls), the Old West Complex (comprising four buildings: Afton, Janss, Rasmussen, and Conejo halls), the Mogen Hall Apartments, Grace Hall, and Trinity Hall. Traditionally, New West attracts much of the sophomore student body, Old West the juniors, and Mogen and Grace the seniors. However, in recent years there has been a virtual complete mixing of sophomores, juniors and seniors all throughout Old West, New West, Mogen, Grace, and Trinity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

====Special housing options and graduate housing====
Kramer Court is a special housing option for undergraduate students. It is located on the east side of campus and each unit comes fully furnished with a living room, two bedrooms, a backyard, and many other features not common to other on-campus housing. These units are application-based and are usually occupied by juniors and seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.callutheran.edu/student-life/housing/kramer-court.html |title=Kramer Court |website=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third floor of Grace Hall has been converted to graduate student housing.

It is located in an area with a conservative political nature. A large number of students have organized a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Club which has gained national prominence by having “the highest ratio of club members to number of students of any College Republican club in [[California]].” Some of their 1997 missions included adding an [[American flag]] to every classroom and having [[Christian]] prayers at student senate meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). ''Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-first Century''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 121. {{ISBN|9780802841216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASCLU-G Student Government===
As of the 2009–2010 academic year, the student government of California Lutheran University is divided into three branches, each possessing different responsibilities. The ASCLU-G (Associated Students of California Lutheran University Government) comprises the Senate, Programs Board, and Executive Cabinet. For Senate and Programs Board, there are four elected positions available per class level as well as a [[transfer student]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], and commuter student position. The Executive Cabinet is made up largely of students who have served on ASCLU-G for one or more years, and contains the offices of the ASCLU President, Programs Board Director, Senate Director, Executive Recorder, and ASCLU Controller. Meetings are held Monday nights, and the entire student body is welcome to attend. Elections are held in the spring semester for all positions for the next academic year and in the fall semester to elect the four freshmen positions and any unfilled spots from the spring election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.callutheran.edu/student_life/asclu/ |title=Associated Students of California Lutheran University |website=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senate====
The ASCLU Senate is primarily responsible for the financial needs of the students. Some of their duties include (but are not limited to): approving and allocating funds to new campus clubs, purchasing equipment for residence halls, and discussing and/or changing campus dining policies. The Senate is usually divided into three or four committees, headed by a committee chair (who has usually served on Senate for one or more years), and each has a specific jurisdiction regarding campus policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.callutheran.edu/students/asclug/senate/ |title=Senate |website=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Programs Board====
The ASCLU-G Programs Board is primarily responsible for planning, organizing, financing, and running many of the on- and off-campus events that go on throughout each academic year. The principal event that Programs Board is responsible for is known as "Club Lu", a free event for traditional undergraduate students every Friday night. Each Club Lu event is different; previous events include rollerskating, on-campus dances, ice skating, bowling, movie nights, the Homecoming carnival, Christmas festivals, and talent shows. Programs Board is also responsible for planning larger off-campus events such as the Homecoming Dance and Spring Formal. Like Senate, Programs Board is divided into three or four committees, each headed by a committee chair (who has usually served on Programs Board for one or more years), and each is assigned specific events to plan throughout the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.callutheran.edu/students/asclug/programs-board/ |title=Programs Board |website=California Lutheran University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is Lars Pederson's original home which has been relocated to Faculty Street on campus. It is known as [[Pederson House and Water Tower]] and is designated Ventura County Historical Landmark number 45 and Thousand Oaks Historical Landmark number 3.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprankling, Miriam (2002).

The '''Census of Marine Life''' was a 10-year, US $650 million scientific initiative, involving a global network of researchers in more than 80 nations, engaged to assess and explain the [[Biodiversity|diversity]], distribution, and abundance of [[Marine life|life in the oceans]]. The world's first comprehensive Census of Marine Life &amp;mdash; past, present, and future &amp;mdash; was released in 2010 in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coml.org/pressreleases/census2010/PDF/Census-2010_Public_News_Release.pdf |title=2010 Census of Marine Life News Release, 23 September 2010 |publisher=coml.org |date= 23 September 2010|accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially supported by funding from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the project was successful in generating many times that initial investment in additional support and substantially increased the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms, as well as engaging over 2,700 different researchers for the first time in a global collaborative community united in a common goal, and has been described as "one of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted".

==Project history==
According to [[Jesse H. Ausubel|Jesse Ausubel]], Senior Research Associate of the Program for the Human Environment of [[Rockefeller University]] and  science advisor to the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the idea for a "Census of Marine Life" originated in conversations between himself and Dr. [[J. Frederick Grassle]], an oceanographer and benthic ecology professor at [[Rutgers University]], in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/Image%20Census.pdf Entwisle, Amy. 2011. "What Lies Beneath" Interview with Jesse Ausubel, Co-Founder, Census of Marine Life. Imagine Magazine, Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, January 2011; retrieved from phe.rockefeller.edu website (July 25 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Grassle had been urged to talk with Ausubel by former colleagues at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and was at that time unaware that Ausubel was also a program manager at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, funders of a number of other large scale "public good" science-based projects such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;Grassle, Fred. 2010. Introduction. Pp. ix-xi in McIntyre, Alistair D. (editor). Life in the World's Oceans: Diversity, Distribution, and Abundance. chapter available at http://comlmaps.org/mcintyre/forward/introduction-fred-grassel&lt;/ref&gt; Ausubel was instrumental in persuading the Foundation to fund a series of "feasibility workshops" over the period 1997-1998 into how the project might be conducted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/reports-other-documents/feasibility-workshops/ Census of Marine Life: Feasibility workshops. Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; one result of these workshops being the broadening of the initial concept from a "Census of the Fishes" into a comprehensive "Census of Marine Life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Census-of-the-Fishes_Update-1999.pdf Ausubel, Jesse H. 1999. "The Census of the Fishes: An Update." Draft document available from Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from these workshops, plus associated invited contributions, formed the basis of a special issue of ''Oceanography'' magazine in 1999;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-12-issue-03 Oceanography Vol. 12, No. 3, Special Issue: Census of Marine Life]&lt;/ref&gt; later that year, a workshop in [[Washington, D.C.]] addressed the formation of an [[Ocean Biogeographic Information System]] (OBIS) which would serve to collate existing knowledge about the distribution of organisms in the ocean and form the information management component of the Census.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/13-3_grassle.pdf Grassle, J.F. 2000. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context. ''Oceanography'' 13(3), pp. 5-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census began in a formal sense with the announcement in May 2000 of eight grants totaling about 4 million US$ to create OBIS, as reported in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] magazine, 2 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA62924795&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=00368075&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w Malakoff, David. 2000. "Grants Kick Off Ambitious Count of All Ocean Life." [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], vol. 288, no. 5471, p. 1575.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001"&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/COML_Aug2001/ Ausubel, Jesse H. 2001. "The Census of Marine Life: progress and prospects." ''Fisheries'' Volume 26(7): 33-36.]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, an International Scientific Steering Committee was formed in 1999, which by 2001 envisaged "about half a dozen  pilot [field] programs" for the period 2002-2004 which, along with OBIS and another project called "History of Marine Animal Populations" (HMAP), would provide the initial activities of the Census, to be followed by an additional series of field programs in 2005-2007, culminating in an analysis and integration phase in 2008-2010.&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001" /&gt; During the operation of the Census, an additional non-field project was added, the [[Future of Marine Animal Populations]] (FMAP), which concentrated on forecasting the future of life in the oceans using [[scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]] tools.

As a general method of working, project proposals would be debated within the Scientific Steering Committee and, if recommended for funding, a formal submission would be made to the Sloan Foundation for funding to support the Principal Investigators (PIs) and a Project Coordinator, meetings of project participants, and additional Synthesis and Education and Outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sloan Foundation approval was dependent on promises of contributions from additional sources, and projects were encouraged to bring additional resources on board during their operation, the Foundation funds committed were effectively leveraged many times to provide a much more substantial program than would otherwise have been possible. As core infrastructure components, the Foundation also supported the Census' International Scientific Steering Committee and Secretariat, the U.S. National Committee, and an Education and Outreach Network to lift the project's visibility and engage other nations and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sloan.org/programs/completed-programs/census-of-marine-life The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation: Completed programs: Census of Marine Life. Retrieved 26 July 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Census was ultimately estimated to have cost US $650 million, of which the Sloan Foundation contributed US $75 million with the remainder supplied by a large number of participating institutions, countries, and national and international organizations in the form of both direct and in-kind contributions.&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release" /&gt;{{efn|The Census was the largest, but not the only commitment of Sloan funds to "big science" in that decade; from information on its website https://www.sloan.org, the Foundation also provided US $11.5 million to the [[Barcode of Life]] project, an initial grant of $2.5 million to the [[Encyclopedia of Life]], and $18 million to the ethics of Synthetic Biology. Funding to the Census may be eventually surpassed by that to the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (US $60 million to 2017, refer http://www.sciencephilanthropyalliance.org/science-philanthropy-success-story-the-sloan-foundations-25-year-partnership-with-the-sloan-digital-sky-survey/), however that program has existed over a considerably longer period (1992-current).}}

In a retrospective review in 2011, David Penman and co-authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Census had its inception in a visionary leader (Grassle) who was able to convince a small group of colleagues of the need for such a project and find a like-minded individual (Ausubel) who saw the opportunity for the Sloan Foundation to take a key role in bring the Census to fruition. This was not leadership that sought out problems to solve – it identified an issue that could not be addressed through conventional national funding mechanisms and could only be approached through a large-scale collaborative endeavour. The Sloan Foundation saw the opportunity to facilitate new science that would also contribute knowledge for wide societal benefit."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Census program==
The Census consisted of three major component themes organized around the questions:

#What has lived in the oceans?
#What does live in the oceans?
#What will live in the oceans?

The largest component of the Census involved investigating what currently lives in the world's oceans through 14 field projects. Each sampled the biota in one of six realms of the global oceans using a range of technologies. These projects were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', rear cover listing&lt;/ref&gt;

* Arctic Ocean: '''ArcOD''' ([[Arctic Ocean Diversity]])
* Antarctic Ocean: '''CAML''' ([[Census of Antarctic Marine Life]])
* Mid-Ocean Ridges: '''MAR-ECO''' ([[Mid-Atlantic Ridge Ecosystem Project]])
* Vents and Seeps: '''ChEss''' ([[Biogeography of Deep-Water Chemosynthetic Ecosystems]])
* Abyssal Plains: '''CeDAMar''' ([[Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life]])
* Seamounts: '''CenSeam''' ([[Global Census of Marine Life on Seamounts]])
* Continental Margins: '''COMARGE''' (Continental Margin Ecosystems)
* Continental Shelves: '''POST''' ([[Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project]])
* Near Shore: '''NaGISA''' ([[Natural Geography in Shore Areas]])
* Coral Reefs: '''CReefs''' ([[Census of Coral Reefs]])
* Regional Ecosystems: '''GoMA''' ([[Gulf of Maine Program]])
* Microbes: '''ICoMM''' ([[International Census of Marine Microbes]])
* Zooplankton: '''CMarZ''' ([[Census of Marine Zooplankton]])
* Top Predators: '''TOPP''' ([[Tagging of Pacific Predators]])

These field projects were complemented by the three non-field Census projects, namely HMAP, FMAP and OBIS. A series of National and Regional Implementation Committees (NRICs) was also established to progress the involvement of particular countries and regions in Census activities. Towards the end of the project, additional teams were created for education and outreach, and mapping and vizualization products, while a "synthesis" group coordinated the final outcomes (publications, etc.).

==Outcomes==
During its lifespan, the Census involved some 2,700 scientists from more 80 countries who spent 9,000 days at sea participating in more than 540 census-badged expeditions,&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as uncounted nearshore sampling events. In addition to many thousands of records of previously known species, Census scientists found more than 6,000 marine species potentially new to science and had completed formal descriptions of 1,200 of them up to 2010. Census scientists visited many parts of the global ocean to learn more about species ranging in size from the blue whale to minute zooplankton and microbes (bacteria and viruses); sampled from the world's coldest regions to the warm tropics, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to coastal ecosystems; tracked the movements of fish and interrogated historical records to learn what the ocean used to be like before the influence of humans; and employed forecasting methods to predict what may happen to ocean life in the future. One of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted, by 2011 the Census had produced over 3,100 scientific papers and many thousands of other information products, with over 30 million species distribution records freely available via OBIS.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages vii, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as its tangible scientific legacy, the Census was instrumental in building a global community of researchers, many of whom had never collaborated before until they were brought together under the auspices of the Census, and a new approach to collaborative research. As Ian Poiner, outgoing chair of the Census has said, "The Census changed our views on how things could be done. We shared our problems and we shared our solutions."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page iii.&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2011 review of the Census commissioned by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, David Penman and co-authors wrote: "[Prior to the Census there was] A fragmented research community: Marine biodiversity researchers had few active coordinated national and international research programs and taxonomic research in particular was underfunded and scattered in disparate organizations... [there was] No culture of collaboration and data sharing: Unlike the oceanographic community, marine biology was characterized by small research projects leading to publications but there was little experience or willingness to openly collaborate and share data... [and in addition there was] No recognized open-access data portal for marine biodiversity data: Unlike the "physical science" oceanographic community, there was no recognized data depository or common standards for sharing marine biodiversity data."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarizing remarks, Penman ''et al.'', writing in 2011, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Census, by any statistical measure, was a great success. The large number of scientific papers published and still to be published by Census participants, alone, would be sufficient. Instead the Census has achieved truly global science in biology. It did not profess to provide a complete Census of life in the ocean in 2010 but it did substantially increase the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms. From this knowledge base future research and surveys will add more data that can be shared through web-based services such as OBIS. From this we may be able to derive estimates of population diversity, distribution and abundance for selected groups of organisms or regions and a future compilation of such data will show how far our knowledge has moved from 2010... Undoubtedly much research on marine biodiversity would have been carried out over the last decade without the Census. But it would have lacked the global reach and the access to data and technologies that made the Census unique."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the Census Steering Committee received the [[International Cosmos Prize]] in recognition of its decade of international ocean research spanning multiple scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/main/cosmos/jyusyou/2011_e.html Expo '90 Foundation: International Cosmos Prize: The Prizewinner 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The Census partnered with the [[Encyclopedia of Life]] in creating pages for marine species, and supplied marine material for DNA barcoding in the [[Barcode of Life]] project. [[Google]] and Census of Marine Life partnered on [[Google Earth]] 5.0. Ocean in Google Earth contains a layer devoted to the Census of Marine Life that allows users to follow scientists from the Census on expeditions and see marine life and features found during the Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/02/google-earth-oceans |title=Google Earth adds insight into Earth's oceans &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-23 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership with the French film company Galatée Films resulted in the production of the film ''[[Oceans (film)|Oceans]]'' which was released in 2009, featuring film of over 200 species at more than 50 global locations.&lt;ref&gt;Snelgrove, pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2767">The '''Centro de Formação e Desenvolvimento dos Trabalhadores da Saúde de São Paulo''' (''Center for Education and Development of Health Care Workers of São Paulo'', in [[Portuguese language]] - abbreviated CEFOR-SP) is a division of the Municipal Secretary of Health of [[São Paulo]], created on March 30, 1990 by the Municipal Law No. 28,625.

The Center aims to train and to develop [[human resources]] for the Secretary's [[workforce]], as well as the production and dissemination of educational materials to support these actions. Another objective is to complete and to supplement the primary and secondary education of its employees. Thus it is expected that the personal and professional development of the more than 57,000 public health care workers will benefit directly and indirectly the continuing improvement of [[quality of care]] provided to the citizens of São Paulo.

==Technical School of the Unified Health System of São Paulo==

The '''Escola Técnica do SUS de São Paulo''' (ETSUS-SP) was created by Municipal Decree No. 42,120 of 19 June 2002. It is affiliated and coordinated by CEFOR-SP, and has eight regional branches (South, Southeast I and II, East I and II, North I and II, and Center-West)

The school offers secondary-level [[TAFE|technical vocational course]]s in [[allied health care]] with minimum duration of 1,200 hours, and provides certification which is valid for the entire national territory:

* [[Pharmaceutical care]]
* [[Environmental health]]
* [[Health systems management|Management]] of Health Care Units
* [[Orthopedics]] Technician
* [[Pharmacy]] Technician
* [[Nursing]] Technician
* [[Dental hygienist]]
* [[Community health agent]]

==Distance education==
CEFOR-SP in charge of educational coordination of the '''[[Rede São Paulo Saudável]]''' (''Healthy São Paulo Network'') [[professional education]] [[digital TV]] channel and [[distance education]] initiatives of the Secretary of Health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">{{about|the philosophical concept of "Communicative Action"|Jurgen Habermas's magnum opus|The Theory of Communicative Action}}
In [[sociology]], '''communicative action''' is cooperative action undertaken by individuals based upon mutual deliberation and argumentation. The term was developed by [[Germany|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]-[[sociologist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] in his work ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''.

== Structures ==

Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for [[rationality]]. This rationality, however, is "no longer tied to, and limited by, the subjectivistic and individualistic premises of modern philosophy and social theory."&lt;ref name=Habermas&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Theory of Communicative Action'', trans. Thomas McCarthy, Boston: Beacon Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} Instead, Habermas situates rationality as a capacity inherent within language, especially in the form of argumentation. "We use the term argumentation for that type of speech in which participants thematize contested validity claims and attempt to vindicate or criticize them through argumentation."&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|18}} The structures of argumentative speech, which Habermas identifies as the absence of coercive force, the mutual search for understanding, and the compelling power of the better argument, form the 
key features from which intersubjective rationality can make communication possible. Action undertaken by participants through a process of such argumentative communication can be assessed as to their rationality to the extent which they fulfill those criteria.

[[Communicative rationality]] is distinct from instrumental, normative, and dramaturgic rationality by its ability to concern all three "worlds" as he terms them, following [[Karl Popper]]—the subjective, objective, and intersubjective or social. Communicative rationality is self-reflexive and open to a dialogue in which participants in an argument can learn from others and from themselves by reflecting upon their premises and thematizing aspects of their cultural background knowledge to question suppositions that typically go without question.

Communicative action is action based upon this deliberative process, where two or more individuals interact and coordinate their action based upon agreed interpretations of the situation.&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|86}} Communicative action is distinguished by Habermas from other forms of action, such as instrumental action, which is pure goal-oriented behavior, dealt with primarily in economics, by taking all functions of language into consideration.&lt;ref name=Habermas/&gt;{{rp|95}} That is, communicative action has the ability to reflect upon language used to express propositional truth, normative value, or subjective self-expression.

==Social implications==

Much of Habermas' work has been in response to his predecessors in the [[Frankfurt School]]. Communicative rationality, for instance, can be seen as a response to the critique of enlightenment reason expressed in [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno|T.W. Adorno]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. Horkheimer and Adorno had argued that the Enlightenment saw a particular kind of rationality enshrined as dominant in western culture, instrumental reason, which had only made possible the more effective and ruthless manipulation of nature and human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno and Horkheimer, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', trans. Edmund Jephcott, Palo Alto: Stanford UP, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas' form of [[critical theory]] is designed to rediscover through the analysis of positive potentials for human rationality in the medium of language, the possibility of a critical form of reason that can lead to reflection and examination of not only objective questions, but also those of social norms, human values, and even aesthetic expression of subjectivity.

Habermas' earlier work, ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', anticipates his concern for argumentation and can be read retrospectively as a historical case study of Western European societies institutionalizing aspects of communicative action in the political and social spheres. Habermas notes the rise of institutions of public debate in late seventeenth and eighteenth century Britain and France especially. In these nations, information exchange and communication methods pioneered by capitalist merchants became adapted to novel purposes and were employed as an outlet for the public use of reason. The notion of communicative rationality in the public sphere is therefore heavily indebted to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s formulation of the public use of reason in ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' Habermas argues that the [[bourgeoisie]] who participated in this incipient [[public sphere]] universalized those aspects of their class that enabled them to present the public sphere as inclusive—he even goes so far as to say that a public sphere that operates upon principles of exclusivity is not a public sphere at all.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'', trans. Thomas McCarthy, Cambridge MA: MIT Pres, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on foundations of democracy established in this work carried over to his later examination in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]'' that greater democratization and the reduction to barriers to participation in public discourse (some of which he identified in the first public sphere of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) could open the door to a more open 
form of social action. The shift from a more Marxist focus on the economic bases of discourse in Structural Transformation to a more "super-structural" emphasis on language and communication in ''Theory of Communicative Action'' signals Habermas' transition to a post-Marxist framework.

==Critiques==

Habermas views communication and debate in the public sphere as argumentatively [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. Critics have argued that Habermas' notion of communicative rationality, upon which communicative action must be based, is illusory. The formal prerequisites of equality among argument participants, for instance, may mask the reality of unequal social capital. "There is no guarantee that a formally symmetrical distribution of opportunities to select and employ speech acts will result in anything more than an expression of the status quo."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Miller, ''Domination and Power'', Routledge, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ian McNeeley, for instance, contrasts Habermas' view with Michel Foucault's notion of communication as embodying pre-existing power relationships: "Jürgen Habermas subscribes to an unrealistic ideal of power-free communication…Michel Foucault remedies this idealism by treating knowledge as power; his work is in fact suffused with applications of knowledge for the control of human bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McNeeley, ''The Emancipation of Writing'', Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a like manner, the discursive fiction of consensus achieved through rational argumentation might be used as a legitimating prop for social action to the detriment of marginalized members-this is the basis of much feminist critique of Habermas' notions.

Another radical critique is that of [[Nikolas Kompridis]], a former student of Habermas, who views Habermas' theory as another attempt to arrive at a "[[view from nowhere]]", this time by locating rationality in procedures of reaching agreement independent of any particular participants' perspective or background. In response, he proposes a "[[reflective disclosure|possibility-disclosing]]" role of reason to correct the problems with Habermas' work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolas Kompridis]], ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNA base flipping''', or '''nucleotide flipping''', is a mechanism in which a single [[nucleotide]] base, or [[nucleobase]], is rotated outside the nucleic acid double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume=67 | issue=1 | title=Base flipping | journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry | pages=181–198 | last1 = Roberts | first1 = RJ | last2 = Cheng | first2 = X | doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs when a nucleic acid-processing [[enzyme]] needs access to the base to perform work on it, such as its excision for replacement with another base during [[Base excision repair|DNA repair]].  It was first observed in 1994 using [[X-ray crystallography]] in a [[methyltransferase]] enzyme catalyzing methylation of a [[cytosine]] base in DNA. Since then, it has been shown to be used by different enzymes in many biological processes such as [[DNA methylation]], various [[DNA repair]] mechanisms, and [[DNA replication]]. It can also occur in RNA double helices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15504036 | doi=10.1021/bi048815y | volume=43 | title=Dynamics in the U6 RNA intramolecular stem-loop: a base flipping conformational change | journal=Biochemistry | pages=13739–47 | last1 = Reiter | first1 = NJ | last2 = Blad | first2 = H | last3 = Abildgaard | first3 = F | last4 = Butcher | first4 = SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the DNA:RNA intermediates formed during [[RNA transcription]].

DNA base flipping occurs by breaking the [[Hydrogen bonds#Hydrogen bonds in DNA and proteins|hydrogen bonds]] between the bases and unstacking the base from its neighbors.  This could occur through an active process, where an enzyme binds to the DNA and then facilitates rotation of the base, or a passive process, where the 
base rotates out spontaneously, and this state is recognized and bound by an enzyme. It can be detected using 
[[X-ray crystallography]], [[NMR spectroscopy]], [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], or [[Chemical probe|hybridization probes]].

==Discovery==
Base flipping was first observed in 1994 when researchers Klimasauskas, Kumar, Roberts, and Cheng used [[X-ray crystallography]] to view an intermediate step in the chemical reaction of a [[methyltransferase]] bound to [[DNA]].&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klimasauskas|first=Saulius|author2=Kumar, Sanjay |author3=Roberts, Richard J. |author4= Cheng, Xiaodong |title=Hhal methyltransferase flips its target base out of the DNA helix|journal=Cell|date=January 1994|volume=76|issue=2|pages=357–369|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90342-5|url=http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/0092867494903425 |pmid=8293469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The methyltransferase they used was the C5-cytosine methyltransferase from ''[[Haemophilus haemolyticus]]'' (M. HhaI).  This enzyme recognizes a specific sequence of the DNA (5'-GCGC-3') and methylates the first [[cytosine]] base of the sequence at its C5 location.&lt;ref name=original /&gt;  Upon crystallization of the M. HhaI-DNA complex, they saw the target cytosine base was rotated completely out of the double helix and was positioned in the active site of the M. HhaI.  It was held in place by numerous interactions between the M. HhaI and DNA.&lt;ref name=original /&gt; 
  
The authors theorized that base flipping was a mechanism used by many other enzymes, such as [[helicases]], recombination [[enzyme]]s, [[RNA polymerase]]s, [[DNA polymerases]], and [[Type II topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=original /&gt;  Much research has been done in the years subsequent to this discovery and it has been found that base flipping is a mechanism used in many of the biological processes the authors suggest.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Tom|title=Nucleic Acids Book|url=http://www.atdbio.com/content/54/Base-flipping#Further-reading|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Niu|author2=Nilesh K.

==Biological processes==

===DNA modification and repair===
[[File:Uracil base glycosidase.jpg|thumb|200px | right|alt=Model of uracil DNA glycosylase and flipped uracil residue| A uracil residue flipped out of the DNA double helix and into the specificity pocket of Uracil DNA glycosylase]]
DNA can have [[mutation]]s that cause a base in the DNA strand to be damaged.  To ensure genetic integrity of the DNA, enzymes need to repair any damage.  There are many types of [[DNA repair]].  [[Base excision repair]] utilizes base flipping to flip the damaged base out of the double helix&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt; and into the specificity pocket of a [[DNA glycosylase|glycosylase]] which hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond and removes the base.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Tania A. Baker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alexander Gann, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Michael Levine, University of California, Berkeley, Richard Losik, Harvard|title=Molecular biology of the gene|year=2014|publisher=Pearson/CSH Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-321-76243-6|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA glycosylases interact with DNA, flipping bases to determine a mismatch.  An example of base excision repair occurs when a cytosine base is deaminated and becomes a uracil base.  This causes a U:G mispair which is detected by [[DNA glycosylase#Uracil DNA glycosylases|Uracil DNA glycosylase]].  The uracil base is flipped out into the glycosylase active pocket where it is removed from the DNA strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krokan|first=Hans E|author2=Drabløs, Finn |author3=Slupphaug, Geir |title=Uracil in DNA – occurrence, consequences and repair|journal=Oncogene|date=16 December 2002|volume=21|issue=58|pages=8935–8948|doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1205996|pmid=12483510}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Base flipping is used to repair mutations such as [[8-Oxoguanine]] (oxoG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Anirban|author2=Yang, Wei |author3=Karplus, Martin |author4= Verdine, Gregory L. |title=Structure of a repair enzyme interrogating undamaged DNA elucidates recognition of damaged DNA|journal=Nature|date=31 March 2005|volume=434|issue=7033|pages=612–618|doi=10.1038/nature03458 |pmid=15800616}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[thymine dimer]]s created by UV radiation.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuxreiter|first=Monika|author2=Luo, Ning |author3=Jedlovszky, Pál |author4=Simon, István |author5= Osman, Roman |title=Role of Base Flipping in Specific Recognition of Damaged DNA by Repair Enzymes|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=November 2002|volume=323|issue=5|pages=823–834|doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication, transcription and recombination===
[[DNA replication]] and [[RNA transcription]] both make use of base flipping.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt;  [[DNA replication#DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase]] is an enzyme that carries out replication.  It can be thought of as a hand that grips the DNA single strand template.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;  As the template passes across the palm region of the polymerase, the template bases are flipped out of the helix and away from the [[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTP]] binding site.&lt;ref name="dna poly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=Premal H.|author2=Suzuki, Motoshi |author3=Adman, Elinor |author4=Shinkai, Akeo |author5= Loeb, Lawrence A. |title=Prokaryotic DNA polymerase I: evolution, structure, and "base flipping" mechanism for nucleotide selection|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=May 2001|volume=308|issue=5|pages=823–837|doi=10.1006/jmbi.2001.4619 |pmid=11352575}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  During transcription, [[RNA polymerase]] catalyzes RNA synthesis.

===DNA methylation===
[[File:DNA methylation.jpg|thumb|left|170px |alt=DNA methylation illustration|DNA molecule that is methylated on both strands on the center cytosine]]

===Target recognition by restriction endonucleases===
Restriction endonucleases, also known as [[restriction enzyme]]s are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the [[DNA]] at specific [[nucleotides]] sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long.&lt;ref&gt;http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/enzymes/renzymes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Studies performed by Horton and colleagues have shown that the mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as bending the DNA and the expansion of the [[minor groove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = John R. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Xing | last3 = Maunus | first3 = Robert | last4 = Yang | first4 = Zhe | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Geoffrey | last6 = Roberts | first6 = Richard | last7 = Cheng | first7 = Xiaodong | year = 2006 | title = DNA Nicking by HinP1I Endonuclease: Bending, Base Flipping and Minor Groove Expansion | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 939–948 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkj484 | pmid=16473850 | pmc=1363774}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Horton and colleagues, [[x-ray crystallography]] evidence was presented showing that the restriction endonuclease HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This [[enzyme]] is known to cleave the DNA at the [[palindromic sequence|palindromic]] tetranucleotide sequence G↓CGC.

==Experimental approaches for detection==

===X-ray crystallography===
[[File:X ray diffraction.png|thumb|right|200px |alt= X-ray crystallography workflow|Workflow for solving the structure of a molecule by X-ray crystallography]]
[[X-ray crystallography]] is a technique that measures the angles and intensities of [[crystal structure|crystalline atoms]] in order to determine the atomic and molecular structure of the crystal of interest.  Crystallographers are then able to produce and three-dimensional picture where the positions of the [[atoms]], [[chemical bonds]] as well as other important characteristics can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[[X-ray crystallography]]&lt;/ref&gt; Klimasaukas and colleagues used this technique to observe the first base flipping phenomenon, in which their experimental procedure involved several steps:&lt;ref name=original /&gt; 
# Purification
# Crystallization
# Data Collection
# Structure determination and refinement
During purification, Haemophilus haemolyticus [[methyltransferase]] was [[gene expression|overexpressed]] and purified using a high salt back-extraction step to selectively solubilize M.HhaI, followed by fast protein liquid chromatography ([[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]]) as done previously by Kumar and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = S | last2 = Cheng | first2 = X | last3 = Pflugrath | first3 = JW | last4 = Roberts | first4 = RJ | year = 1992 | title = Purification, Crystallization, and Preliminary X-ray Diffraction Analysis of an M.HhaI-AdoMet Complex | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 31 | issue = 36| pages = 8648–8653 | doi=10.1021/bi00151a035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors utilized a Mono-Q anion exchange column to remove the small quantity of [[proteinaceous]] materials and unwanted DNA prior to the crystallization step. Once M.HhaI was successfully purified, the sample was then grown using a method that mixes the solution containing the complex at a temperature of 16&amp;nbsp;°C and the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique to obtain the crystals. Authors were then able to collect the x-ray data according to a technique used by Cheng and colleagues in 1993.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = X | last2 = Kumar | first2 = S | last3 = Posfai | first3 = J | last4 = Pflugrath | first4 = JW | last5 = Roberts | first5 = RJ | year = 1993 | title = Crystal Structure of the HhaI DNA Methyltransferase Complexed with S-adenosyl-L-methionine | url = | journal = Cell Press | volume = 74 | issue = 2| pages = 299–307 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90421-l | pmid=8343957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique involved the measurement of the diffraction intensities on a FAST detector, where the exposure times for 0.1° rotation were 5 or 10 seconds. For the structure determination and refinement, Klimasaukas and colleagues used the molecular replacement of the refined apo structure described by Cheng and colleagues in 1993&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; where the search models  [[X-PLOR]], [[MERLOT]], and TRNSUM were used to solve the rotation and translation functions.&lt;ref&gt;Brunger A.T.

===NMR spectroscopy===
[[NMR spectroscopy]] is a technique that has been used over the years to study important dynamic aspects of base flipping. This technique allows researchers to determine the physical and chemical properties of [[atoms]] and other molecules by utilizing the magnetic properties of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NMR spectroscopy]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,  NMR can provide a variety of information including structure, [[chemical kinetics|reaction states]], chemical environment of the molecules, and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Gueron, M., and J.

In order to accomplish this experiment, two [[flucytosine|5-fluorocytosine]] residues were incorporated into the target and the reference position with the DNA substrate so the &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F chemical shift analysis could be performed. Once the [[isotopes of fluorine|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F]] chemical shift analysis was evaluated, it was then concluded that the DNA complexes existed with multiple forms of the target 5-fluorocytosine along the base flipping pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Klimasaukas, Salius, and Zita Liutkeviciute.

===Fluorescence spectroscopy===
[[Fluorescence spectroscopy]] is a technique that is used to assay a sample using a fluorescent probe.

[[Chemical probe|Hybridization probes]] can be used to detect base flipping.

'''DNA supercoiling''' refers to the over- or under-winding of a DNA strand, and is an expression of the strain on that strand.  Supercoiling is important in a number of biological processes, such as compacting DNA, and by regulating access to the genetic code, DNA supercoiling strongly affects DNA metabolism and possibly gene expression. Additionally, certain enzymes such as [[topoisomerase]]s are able to change DNA topology to facilitate functions such as [[DNA replication]] or [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bar | first1 = A. | last2 = Mukamel | first2 = D. | last3 = Kabakçoǧlu | first3 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Denaturation of circular DNA: Supercoil mechanism | url = | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 84 | issue = 4| page = | doi=10.1103/physreve.84.041935| arxiv = 1108.5444| bibcode = 2011PhRvE..84d1935B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematical expressions are used to describe supercoiling by comparing different coiled states to relaxed B-form DNA.

==Overview==

In a "relaxed" double-helical segment of [[B-DNA]], the two strands twist around the helical axis once every 10.4–10.5 [[base pair]]s of [[DNA sequence|sequence]]. Adding or subtracting twists, as some [[enzyme]]s can do, imposes strain. If a DNA segment under twist strain were closed into a circle by joining its two ends and then allowed to move freely, the circular DNA would contort into a new shape, such as a simple figure-eight. Such a contortion is a '''supercoil'''. The noun form "supercoil" is often used in the context of [[DNA topology]].

Positively supercoiled (overwound) DNA is transiently generated during DNA replication and transcription, and, if not promptly relaxed, inhibits (regulates) these processes. The simple figure eight is the simplest supercoil, and is the shape a circular DNA assumes to accommodate one too many or one too few helical twists. The two lobes of the figure eight will appear rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to one another, depending on whether the helix is over- or underwound. For each additional helical twist being accommodated, the lobes will show one more rotation about their axis. As a general rule, the DNA of most organisms is negatively supercoiled.&lt;ref name=Champoux&gt;{{cite journal |author=Champoux J |title=DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=70 |pages=369–413 |year=2001 |pmid=11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobal contortions of a circular DNA, such as the rotation of the figure-eight lobes above, are referred to as ''[[writhe]]''. The above example illustrates that twist and writhe are interconvertible.  Supercoiling can be represented mathematically by the sum of twist and writhe. The twist is the number of helical turns in the DNA and the writhe is the number of times the double helix crosses over on itself (these are the supercoils). Extra helical twists are positive and lead to positive supercoiling, while subtractive twisting causes negative supercoiling. Many [[topoisomerase]] enzymes sense supercoiling and either generate or dissipate it as they change DNA topology.

In part because [[chromosome]]s may be very large, segments in the middle may act as if their ends are anchored. As a result, they may be unable to distribute excess twist to the rest of the chromosome or to absorb twist to recover from underwinding—the segments may become ''supercoiled'', in other words. In response to supercoiling, they will assume an amount of writhe, just as if their ends were joined.

Supercoiled DNA forms two structures; a plectoneme or a toroid, or a combination of both. A negatively supercoiled DNA molecule will produce either a one-start left-handed helix, the toroid, or a two-start right-handed helix with terminal loops, the plectoneme. Plectonemes are typically more common in nature, and this is the shape most bacterial [[plasmid]]s will take. For larger molecules it is common for hybrid structures to form – a loop on a toroid can extend into a plectoneme. If all the loops on a toroid extend then it becomes a branch point in the plectonemic structure. DNA supercoiling is important for DNA packaging within all cells, and seems to also play a role in gene expression.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Irobalieva 2015'/&gt;

== Intercalation-induced supercoiling of DNA ==
Based on the properties of [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] molecules i.e., [[Fluorescence|fluorescing]] upon binding to DNA and unwinding of DNA base-pairs,  recently a [[Single-molecule experiment|single-molecule technique]] has been introduced to directly visualize individual plectonemes along supercoiled DNA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganji|first=Mahipal|last2=Kim|first2=Sung Hyun|last3=van der Torre|first3=Jaco|last4=Abbondanzieri|first4=Elio|last5=Dekker|first5=Cees|date=2016-07-13|title=Intercalation-Based Single-Molecule Fluorescence Assay To Study DNA Supercoil Dynamics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02213|journal=Nano Letters|volume=16|issue=7|pages=4699–4707|doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02213|issn=1530-6984|bibcode=2016NanoL..16.4699G}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would further allow to study the interactions of DNA processing proteins with supercoiled DNA. In that study, Sytox Orange (an intercalating dye), has been used to induce supercoiling on surface tethered DNA molecules.

==Functions==

===Genome packaging===

DNA supercoiling is important for DNA packaging within all cells.  Because the length of DNA can be thousands of times that of a cell, packaging this genetic material into the cell or nucleus (in eukaryotes) is a difficult feat.  Supercoiling of DNA reduces the space and allows for DNA to be packaged. In prokaryotes, plectonemic supercoils are predominant, because of the circular chromosome and relatively small amount of genetic material.  In eukaryotes, DNA supercoiling exists on many levels of both plectonemic and solenoidal supercoils, with the solenoidal supercoiling proving most effective in compacting the DNA.  Solenoidal supercoiling is achieved with [[histones]] to form a 10&amp;nbsp;nm fiber.  This fiber is further coiled into a 30&amp;nbsp;nm fiber, and further coiled upon itself numerous times more.

DNA packaging is greatly increased during nuclear division events such as [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]], where DNA must be compacted and segregated to daughter cells.  Condensins and cohesins are ''structural maintenance of chromosome'' (SMC) proteins that aid in the condensation of sister chromatids and the linkage of the centromere in sister chromatids.  These SMC proteins induce positive supercoils. Supercoiling plays also important role in interphase chromosomes during formation and maintanance of topologically associated domains.&lt;ref name="Racko 2018"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Are TADs supercoiled? |vauthors=Racko D, Benedetti F, Dorier J, Stasiak A |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |year=2018| doi=10.1093/nar/gky1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercoiling is also required for DNA/RNA synthesis.  Because DNA must be unwound for DNA/RNA [[polymerase]] action, supercoils will result.  The region ahead of the polymerase complex will be unwound; this stress is compensated with positive supercoils ahead of the complex.  Behind the complex, DNA is rewound and there will be '''compensatory''' negative supercoils.   [[Topoisomerases]] such as [[DNA gyrase]] (Type II Topoisomerase) play a role in relieving some of the stress during DNA/RNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="Albert1996"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Hyper-negative template DNA supercoiling during transcription of the tetracycline-resistance gene in topA mutants is largely constrained in vivo |vauthors=Albert AC, Spirito F, Figueroa-Bossi N, Bossi L, Rahmouni AR |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=24 |issue=15 |pages=3093–3099 |year=1996| doi=10.1093/nar/24.15.3093| pmid=8760899| pmc=146055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene expression===
Specialized proteins can unzip small segments of the DNA molecule when it is replicated or [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. But work published in 2015 illustrates how DNA opens on its own.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Singer |first=Emily |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160105-supercoiled-dna/ |title=How Strange Twists in DNA Orchestrate Life |work=Quanta Magazine |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=2016-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Irobalieva 2015'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA |journal=Nature Communications |date= 12 October 2015 |last=Irobalieva |first=Rossitza N. |last2=Zechiedrich |first2=Lynn |volume=6 |issue=8440 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9440 |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151012/ncomms9440/full/ncomms9440.html |accessdate=2016-01-07 |display-authors=etal |pmid=26455586 |pmc=4608029|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E8440I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply twisting DNA can expose internal bases to the outside, without the aid of any proteins. Also, transcription itself contorts DNA in living human cells, tightening some parts of the coil and loosening it in others. That stress triggers changes in shape, most notably opening up the helix to be read. Unfortunately, these interactions are very difficult to study because biological molecules morph shapes so easily. In 2008 it was noted that transcription twists DNA, leaving a trail of undercoiled (or negatively supercoiled) DNA in its wake. Moreover, they discovered that the DNA sequence itself effects how the molecule responds to supercoiling.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Irobalieva 2015'/&gt; For example, the researchers identified a specific sequence of DNA that regulates transcription speed; as the amount of supercoil rises and falls, it slows or speeds the pace at which molecular machinery reads DNA.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"/&gt; It is hypothesized that these structural changes might trigger stress elsewhere along its length, which in turn might provide trigger points for replication or gene expression.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Irobalieva 2015'/&gt; This implies that it is a very dynamic process in which both DNA and proteins  each influences how the other acts and reacts.&lt;ref name="Quanta 2016"/&gt;

==Mathematical description==

[[File:Helix vs superhelix.png|thumb|Drawing showing the difference between a circular DNA chromosome (a plasmid) with a secondary helical twist only, and one containing an additional tertiary superhelical twist superimposed on the secondary helical winding.]]

In nature, circular DNA is always isolated as a higher-order helix-upon-a-helix, known as a ''superhelix.''  In discussions of this subject, the Watson-Crick twist is referred to as a "secondary" winding, and the superhelices as a "tertiary" winding.  The sketch at right indicates a "relaxed", or "open circular" Watson-Crick double-helix, and, next to it, a right-handed superhelix.  The "relaxed" structure on the left is not found unless the chromosome is nicked; the superhelix is the form usually found in nature.

For purposes of mathematical computations, a right-handed superhelix is defined as having a "negative" number of superhelical turns, and a left-handed superhelix is defined as having a "positive" number of superhelical turns.  In the drawing (shown at the right), both the secondary (''i.e.,'' "Watson-Crick") winding and the tertiary (''i.e.,'' "superhelical") winding are right-handed, hence the supertwists are negative (-3 in this example).

The superhelicity is presumed to be a result of underwinding, meaning that there is a deficiency in the number of secondary Watson-Crick twists.  Such a chromosome will be strained, just as a macroscopic metal spring is strained when it is either overwound or unwound.  In DNA which is thusly strained, supertwists will appear.

DNA supercoiling can be described numerically by changes in the [[linking number]] Lk. The linking number is the most descriptive property of supercoiled DNA. Lk&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of turns in the relaxed (B type) DNA plasmid/molecule, is determined by dividing the total base pairs of the molecule by the relaxed [[Base pair|bp]]/turn which, depending on reference is 10.4;&lt;ref name="shimada1984ring"&gt;{{citation|title=Ring-closure probabilities for twisted wormlike chains.

: &lt;math&gt;Lk_o=bp/10.4&lt;/math&gt;
Lk is merely the number of crosses a single strand makes across the other. '''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''', known as the "linking number", is the number of Watson-Crick twists found in a circular chromosome in a (usually imaginary) planar projection.  This number is physically "locked in" at the moment of covalent closure of the chromosome, and cannot be altered without strand breakage.

The topology of the DNA is described by the equation below in which the linking number is equivalent to the sum of TW, which is the number of twists or turns of the double helix, and Wr which is the number of coils or 'writhes'. If there is a closed DNA molecule, the sum of Tw and Wr, or the linking number, does not change. However, there may be complementary changes in TW and Wr without changing their sum. 
:&lt;math&gt;Lk=Tw+Wr&lt;/math&gt;

'''Tw''', called "twist", refers to the number of Watson-Crick twists in the chromosome when it is not constrained to lie in a plane.  We have already seen that native DNA is usually found to be superhelical.  If one goes around the superhelically twisted chromosome, counting secondary Watson-Crick twists, that number will be different from the number counted when the chromosome is constrained to lie flat.  In general, the number of secondary twists in the native, supertwisted chromosome is expected to be the "normal" Watson-Crick winding number, meaning a single 10-base-pair helical twist for every 34 Å of DNA length.

'''Wr''', called "writhe", is the number of superhelical twists.  Since biological circular DNA is usually underwound, '''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''' will generally be ''less'' than '''Tw''', which means that '''Wr''' will typically be ''negative.''

If DNA is underwound, it will be under strain, exactly as a metal spring is strained when forcefully unwound, and that the appearance of supertwists will allow the chromosome to relieve its strain by taking on negative supertwists, which correct the secondary underwinding in accordance with the topology equation above.

The topology equation shows that there is a one-to-one relationship between changes in '''Tw''' and '''Wr'''.  For example, if a secondary "Watson-Crick" twist is removed, then a right-handed supertwist must have been removed simultaneously (or, if the chromosome is relaxed, with no supertwists, then a left-handed supertwist must be added).

The change in the linking number, ΔLk, is the actual number of turns in the plasmid/molecule, Lk, minus the number of turns in the relaxed plasmid/molecule Lk&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{Lk=Lk-Lk_o}&lt;/math&gt;
If the DNA is negatively supercoiled ΔLk &lt; 0. The negative supercoiling implies that the DNA is underwound.

A standard expression independent of the molecule size is the "specific linking difference" or "superhelical density" denoted σ, that represents the number of turns added or removed relative to the total number of turns in the relaxed molecule/plasmid, indicating the level of supercoiling.
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\Delta{Lk/Lk_o}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Gibbs free energy]] associated with the coiling is given by the equation below&lt;ref name="Vologodskii1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vologodskii AV |title=Fluctuations in superhelical DNA |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=6 |pages=967–982|year=1979 |doi=10.1093/nar/6.3.967 |pmid=155809| name-list-format=vanc| author2=Lukashin AV| author3=Anshelevich VV| display-authors=3| last4=Frank-Kamenetskii| first4=M.D.| issue=3| pmc=327745}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta G/N=10RT \sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in [[Gibbs free energy]] between the supercoiled circular DNA and uncoiled circular DNA with N &gt; 2000 bp is approximated by:
:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta G/N = 700 Kcal/bp * (\Delta Lk/N)}&lt;/math&gt;
or, 16 cal/bp.

Since the linking number ''L'' of supercoiled DNA is the number of times the two strands are intertwined (and both strands remain covalently intact), ''L'' cannot change. The reference state (or parameter) ''L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circular DNA duplex is its relaxed state. In this state, its writhe ''W'' = 0. Since ''L = T + W'', in a relaxed state ''T = L''. Thus, if we have a 400 bp relaxed circular DNA duplex, ''L ~ 40'' (assuming ~10 bp per turn in B-DNA). Then ''T ~ 40''.

*Positively supercoiling:
*:T = 0, W = 0, then L = 0
*:T = +3, W = 0, then L = +3
*:T = +2, W = +1, then L = +3
*Negatively supercoiling:
*:T = 0, W = 0, then L = 0
*:T = -3, W = 0, then L = -3
*:T = -2, W = -1, then L = -3

Negative supercoils favor local unwinding of the DNA, allowing processes such as [[DNA transcription|transcription]], [[DNA replication]], and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. Negative supercoiling is also thought to favour the transition between B-DNA and [[Z-DNA]], and moderate the interactions of DNA binding proteins involved in [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Plant Biotechnology |author=H.

==Effects on sedimentation coefficient==
[[File:Circular DNA s vs pH.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure showing the various conformational changes which are observed in circular DNA at different pH.  At a pH of about 12 (alkaline), there is a dip in the sedimentation coefficient, followed by a relentless increase up to a pH of about 13, at which pH the structure converts into the mysterious "Form IV".]]

The topological properties of circular DNA are complex.  In standard texts, these properties are invariably explained in terms of a helical model for DNA, but in 2008 it was noted that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations.&lt;ref name='Irobalieva 2015'/&gt;

When the sedimentation coefficient, '''''s''''', of circular DNA is ascertained over a large range of [[pH]], the following curves are seen. Three curves are shown here, representing three species of DNA.  From top-to-bottom they are:  "Form IV" (green), "Form I" (blue) and "Form II" (red).

"Form I" (blue curve) is the traditional nomenclature used for the native form of duplex circular DNA, as recovered from viruses and intracellular plasmids.  Form I is covalently closed, and any plectonemic winding which may be present is therefore locked in. If one or more nicks are introduced to Form I, free rotation of one strand with respect to the other becomes possible, and Form II (red curve) is seen.

Form IV (green curve) is the product of alkali denaturation of Form I.  Its structure is unknown, except that it is persistently duplex, and extremely dense.

Between pH 7 and pH 11.5, the sedimentation coefficient '''''s''''', for Form I, is constant.  Then it dips, and at a pH just below 12, reaches a minimum.  With further increases in pH, '''''s''''' then returns to its former value.  It doesn’t stop there, however, but continues to increase relentlessly.  By pH 13, the value of '''''s''''' has risen to nearly 50, two to three times its value at pH 7, indicating an extremely compact structure.

If the pH is then lowered, the '''''s''''' value is not restored.  Instead, one sees the upper, green curve.  The DNA, now in the state known as Form IV, remains extremely dense, even if the pH is restored to the original physiologic range.  As stated previously, the structure of Form IV is almost entirely unknown, and there is no currently accepted explanation for its extraordinary density.  About all that is known about the tertiary structure is that it is duplex, but has no hydrogen bonding between bases.

These behaviors of Forms I and IV are considered to be due to the peculiar properties of duplex DNA which has been covalently closed into a double-stranded circle.  If the covalent integrity is disrupted by even a single nick in one of the strands, all such topological behavior ceases, and one sees the lower Form II curve (&amp;Delta;).  For Form II, alterations in pH have very little effect on '''''s'''''.  Its physical properties are, in general, identical to those of linear DNA.  At pH 13, the strands of Form II simply separate, just as the strands of linear DNA do.  The separated single strands have slightly different '''''s''''' values, but display no significant changes in '''''s''''' with further increases in pH.

A complete explanation for these data is beyond the scope of this article.  In brief, the alterations in '''''s''''' come about because of changes in the superhelicity of circular DNA.  These changes in superhelicity are schematically illustrated by four little drawings which have been strategically superimposed upon the figure above.

Briefly, the alterations of '''''s''''' seen in the pH titration curve above are widely thought to be due to changes in the superhelical winding of DNA under conditions of increasing pH.  Up to pH 11.5, the purported "underwinding" produces a right-handed ("negative") supertwist.  But as the pH increases, and the secondary helical structure begins to denature and unwind, the chromosome (if we may speak anthropomorphically) no longer "wants" to have the full Watson-Crick winding, but rather "wants", increasingly, to be "underwound".  Since there is less and less strain to be relieved by superhelical winding, the superhelices therefore progressively disappear as the pH increases.  At a pH just below 12, all incentive for superhelicity has expired, and the chromosome will appear as a relaxed, open circle.

At higher pH still, the chromosome, which is now denaturing in earnest, tends to unwind entirely, which it cannot do so (because '''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''' is covalently locked in).  Under these conditions, what was once treated as "underwinding" has actually now become "overwinding".  Once again there is strain, and once again it is (in part at least) relieved by superhelicity, but this time in the opposite direction (''i.e.,'' left-handed or "positive").  Each left-handed tertiary supertwist removes a single, now ''undesirable'' right-handed Watson-Crick secondary twist.

The titration ends at pH 13, where Form IV appears.

These recently classified metabolites are distinguished from the many other dihydroxy-PUFA with three conjugated double bonds that do not have this critical ''E'',''Z'',''E'' configuration: they inhibit the function of [[platelets]] and therefore may be involved in controlling and prove useful for inhibiting human diseases which involve the pathological activation of these blood-borne elements.

Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a [[condom]] will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.

The '''Egyptian Petroleum Research Institution''' ('''EPRI''') is a governmental organization in [[Egypt]] founded by the [[decree | presidential decree]] 541 in 1974. It is under the umbrella of the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology, to help advance the development of studies and applications within the oil sector, and to find solutions to both long and short term technical problems.

To effectively carry out this role the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Egypt)|Ministry of petroleum]] is authorized for up to 50% of the EPRI's board of director shares; the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and Development is the head of the EPRI board, other members who are appointed by him to support and back the EPRI mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epri.sci.eg/Default2.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{evolutionary biology}}
'''Fitness''' (often denoted '''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''ω''' in [[population genetics]] models) is the [[Numerical data|quantitative]] representation of [[natural selection|natural]] and [[sexual selection]] within [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]. It can be defined either with respect to a [[genotype]] or to a [[phenotype]] in a given environment. In either case, it describes individual [[reproductive success]] and is equal to the [[expected value|average contribution]] to the [[gene pool]] of the next generation that is made by individuals of the specified genotype or phenotype. The fitness of a genotype is manifested through its phenotype, which is also affected by the developmental environment. The fitness of a given phenotype can also be different in different selective environments.

With [[asexual reproduction]], it is sufficient to assign fitnesses to genotypes. With [[sexual reproduction]], genotypes are scrambled every generation. In this case, fitness values can be assigned to [[allele]]s by averaging over possible genetic backgrounds. Natural selection tends to make [[allele]]s with higher fitness more common over time, resulting in [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution.

The term "Darwinian fitness" can be used to make clear the distinction with [[physical fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wassersug, J. D., and R. J. Wassersug, 1986. Fitness fallacies. Natural History 3:34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness does not include a measure of survival or life-span; [[Herbert Spencer]]'s  well-known phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" should be interpreted as: "Survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."

[[Inclusive fitness]] differs from individual fitness by including the ability of an allele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a different allele. One mechanism of inclusive fitness is [[kin selection]].

==Fitness is a propensity==

Fitness is often defined as a [[propensity]] or probability, rather than the actual number of offspring. For example, according to [[Maynard Smith]], "Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals — for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual. If the first human infant with a gene for levitation were struck by lightning in its pram, this would not prove the new genotype to have low fitness, but only that the particular child was unlucky." &lt;ref&gt;Maynard-Smith, J. (1989) ''Evolutionary Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-19-854215-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, "the fitness of the individual - having an array x of [[phenotypes]] — is the probability, s(x), that the individual will be included among the group selected as parents of the next generation."&lt;ref&gt;Hartl, D. L. (1981) ''A Primer of Population Genetics'' {{ISBN|0-87893-271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models of fitness: asexuals ==

To avoid the complications of sex and recombination, we initially restrict our attention to an asexual population without [[genetic recombination]]. Then fitnesses can be assigned directly to genotypes rather than having to worry about individual alleles. There are two commonly used measures of fitness; absolute fitness and relative fitness.

===Absolute fitness===

The absolute fitness (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) of a genotype is defined as the proportional change in the abundance of that genotype over one generation attributable to selection. For example, if &lt;math&gt; n(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the abundance of a genotype in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in an infinitely large population (so that there is no [[genetic drift]]), and neglecting the change in genotype abundances due to [[mutation]]s, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimura|first1=James F. Crow, Motoo|title=An introduction to population genetics theory|date=1970|publisher=Blackburn Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-1-932846-126|pages=5|edition=[Reprint]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n(t+1)=Wn(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt; 
An absolute fitness larger than 1 indicates growth in that genotype's abundance; an absolute fitness smaller than 1 indicates decline.

===Relative fitness===

Whereas absolute fitness determines changes in genotype abundance, relative fitness (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) determines changes in genotype [[Allele frequency|frequency]]. If &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the total population size in generation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and the relevant genotype's frequency is &lt;math&gt;p(t)=n(t)/N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=\frac{w}{\overline{w}}p(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean relative fitness in the population (again setting aside changes in frequency due to drift and mutation). Relative fitnesses only indicate the change in prevalence of different genotypes relative to each other, and so only their values relative to each other are important; relative fitnesses can be any nonnegative number, including 0. It is often convenient to choose one genotype as a reference and set its relative fitness to 1. Relative fitness is used in the standard [[Genetic drift#Wright.E2.80.93Fisher model|Wright-Fisher]] and [[Moran process|Moran model]]s of population genetics.

Absolute fitnesses can be used to calculate relative fitness, since &lt;math&gt;p(t+1)=n(t+1)/N(t+1)=(W/\overline{W})p(t)&lt;/math&gt; (we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;N(t+1)=\overline{W} N(t) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean absolute fitness in the population). This implies that &lt;math&gt;w/\overline{w}=W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words, relative fitness is proportional to &lt;math&gt;W/\overline{W}&lt;/math&gt;. It is not possible to calculate absolute fitnesses from relative fitnesses alone, since relative fitnesses contain no information about changes in overall population abundance &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Change in genotype frequencies due to selection ===

[[File:Selective sweep, frequency vs time.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Increase in frequency over time of genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which has a 1% greater relative fitness than the other genotype present, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The change in genotype frequencies due to selection follows immediately from the definition of relative fitness,
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p(t+1)-p(t)=\frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p(t) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, a genotype's frequency will decline or increase depending on whether its fitness is lower or greater than the mean fitness, respectively.

In the particular case that there are only two genotypes of interest (e.g. representing the invasion of a new mutant allele), the change in genotype frequencies is often written in a different form. Suppose that two genotypes &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; have fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_B&lt;/math&gt;, and frequencies &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{w}=w_A p + w_B (1-p)&lt;/math&gt;, and so
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{w_A-w_B}{\overline{w}}p(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus, the change in genotype &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s frequency depends crucially on the difference between its fitness and the fitness of genotype &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Supposing that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is more fit than &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and defining the [[selection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;w_A=(1+s)w_B&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain
&lt;center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = \frac{w-\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}p = \frac{s}{1+sp}p(1-p)\approx sp(1-p) &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/center&gt;
where the last approximation hold for &lt;math&gt;s\ll 1&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the fitter genotype's frequency grows approximately [[Logistic function|logistically]].

== History ==
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Herbert Spencer]].]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sociologist]] [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]"  in his 1864 work ''Principles of Biology'' to characterise what [[Charles Darwin]] had called [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5140#back-mark-5140.f5 | title=Letter 5140 – Wallace, A. R. to Darwin, C. R., 2 July 1866 | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5145#mark-5145.f3 | title=Letter 5145 – Darwin, C. R. to Wallace, A. R., 5 July (1866) | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;
^ "Herbert Spencer in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote: 'This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called "natural selection", or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'" {{Citation | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke | title=Better Competition Advocacy | accessdate=29 August 2007 | author=Maurice E. Stucke}}, citing HERBERT SPENCER, THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY 444 (Univ. Press of the Pac. 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] was the first to quantify fitness, in terms of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] of Darwinism and [[Mendelian genetics]] starting with his 1924 paper ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection]]''. The next further advance was the introduction of the concept of [[inclusive fitness]] by the British biologist [[W.D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in his paper on ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]''.

[[Genetic load]] measures the average fitness of a population of individuals, relative either to a theoretical genotype of optimal fitness, or relative to the most fit genotype actually present in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewens|first1=Warren J.|title=Mathematical population genetics.|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387201917|edition=2nd|pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider n genotypes &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} _1 \dots \mathbf{A} _n&lt;/math&gt;, which have the fitnesses &lt;math&gt;w_1 \dots w_n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] &lt;math&gt;p_1 \dots p_n&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Ignoring [[frequency-dependent selection]], then genetic load (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) may be calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt;L = {{w_\max - \bar w}\over w_\max}&lt;/math&gt;

Genetic load may increase when deleterious mutations, migration, [[inbreeding depression|inbreeding]], or [[outbreeding depression|outcrossing]] lower mean fitness. Genetic load may also increase when beneficial mutations increase the maximum fitness against which other mutations are compared; this is known as the [[Haldane's dilemma|substitutional load or cost of selection]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33097">In [[fluid flow]], '''friction loss''' (or skin friction) is the [[Head loss|loss of pressure or “head”]] that occurs in pipe or [[Duct (flow)|duct flow]] due to the effect of the fluid's [[viscosity]] near the surface of the pipe or duct.&lt;ref name=Munson&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In mechanical systems such as [[internal combustion engine]]s, the term refers to the power lost in overcoming the friction between two moving surfaces, a different phenomenon.

== Economics ==
Friction loss is a significant economic concern wherever fluids are made to flow, whether entirely enclosed in a pipe or duct, or with a surface open to the air.
* Historically, it is a concern in [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of all kinds, throughout human history. It is also relevant to sewer lines. Systematic study traces back to [[Henry Darcy]], an aqueduct engineer. 
* Natural flows in river beds are important to human activity; friction loss in a stream bed has an effect on the height of the flow, particularly significant during flooding. 
* The economies of pipelines for petrochemical delivery are highly affected by friction loss. The Yamal–Europe pipeline carries methane at a volume flow rate of 32.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of gas per year, at [[Reynolds number]]s greater than 50&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* In [[hydropower]] applications, the energy lost to skin friction in [[flume]] and [[penstock]] is not available for useful work, say generating electricity. 
* [[Irrigation]] water is pumped at large yearly volumes of flow, entailing significant expense.
* [[HVAC]] systems pump conditioning air on a widespread basis.
* In [[refrigeration]] applications, energy is expended pumping the coolant fluid through pipes or through the condenser. In split systems, the pipes carrying the coolant take the place of the air ducts in HVAC systems. 
* Wells and domestic water systems must be engineered for effective and economical operation.

== Defining Friction Loss ==
In the following discussion, we define volumetric flow rate V̇ (i.e. volume of fluid flowing) 
V̇ = πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v

where
: r = radius of the pipe (for a pipe of circular section, the internal radius of the pipe).
: v = mean velocity of fluid flowing through the pipe.
: A = cross sectional area of the pipe.
In long pipes, the loss in pressure (assuming the pipe is level) is proportional to the length of pipe involved.
Friction loss is then the change in pressure Δp per unit length of pipe ''L''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \Delta p }{ L }. &lt;/math&gt;
When the pressure is expressed in terms of the equivalent height of a column of that fluid, as is common with water, the friction loss is expressed as ''S'', the "head loss" per length of pipe, a dimensionless quantity also known as the ''hydraulic slope''. 
: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{h_f }{ L } = \frac{ 1 }{ \rho  \mathrm{g} } \frac{ \Delta p }{ L } .&lt;/math&gt;
where
: ρ = [[density|density of the fluid]], (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
: g = the local [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]];

== Characterizing Friction Loss ==

&lt;!--This mode of energy loss is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, that flow being characterized as either [[Laminar flow|laminar]] or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]].  
In the case of laminar flow, obtained at low flow velocity, that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the surface, where it is zero. 
In turbulent flow (obtained at higher velocity) a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow.
For turbulent flow, the pressure drop is influenced by the roughness of the surface; in the laminar case, such effects are negligible because the velocity near the surface is zero.&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;--&gt;

Friction loss, which is due to the [[shear stress]] between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within, depends on the conditions of flow and the physical properties of the system. These conditions can be encapsulated into a dimensionless number Re, known as the [[Reynolds number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}=\frac{1}{\nu}VD&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the mean fluid velocity and ''D'' the diameter of the (cylindrical) pipe.  In this expression, the properties of the fluid itself are reduced to the [[kinematic viscosity]] ν
:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where
: μ = [[viscosity|viscosity of the fluid]] (SI kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s)

=== Friction loss in straight pipe ===
The friction loss In a uniform, straight sections of pipe, known as "major loss", is caused by the effects of [[viscosity]], the movement of fluid [[molecules]] against each other or against the (possibly rough) wall of the pipe. Here, it is greatly affected by whether the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]] (Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2000) or [[Turbulent flow|turbulent]] (Re &gt; 4000):&lt;ref name=Munson /&gt;
* In [[laminar flow]], losses are [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation|proportional to fluid velocity]], ''V''; that velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface, where it is zero. The roughness of the pipe surface influences neither the fluid flow nor the friction loss. 
* In [[turbulent flow]], losses are proportional to the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|square of the fluid velocity]], ''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;  here, a layer of chaotic eddies and vortices near the pipe surface, called the viscous sub-layer, forms the transition to the bulk flow. In this domain, the effects of the roughness of the pipe surface must be considered. It is useful to characterize that roughness as the ratio of the roughness height ε to the pipe diameter ''D'', the "relative roughness".  Three sub-domains pertain to turbulent flow:
** In the smooth pipe domain, friction loss is relatively insensitive to roughness. 
** In the rough pipe domain, friction loss is dominated by the relative roughness and is insensitive to Reynolds number.
** In the transition domain, friction loss is sensitive to both. 
* For Reynolds numbers 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, the flow is unstable, varying with time as vortices within the flow form and vanish randomly. This domain of flow is not well modeled, nor are the details well understood.

=== Form friction ===
Factors other than straight pipe flow induce friction loss; these are known as “minor loss”:
* Fittings, such as bends, couplings, valves, or transitions in [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] or [[piping|pipe]] diameter, or
* Objects intruded into the fluid flow.
For the purposes of calculating the total friction loss of a system, the sources of form friction are sometimes reduced to an equivalent length of pipe.

== Measurements ==
Because of the importance of friction loss in civil engineering and in industry, it has been studied extensively for over a century.

== Calculating friction loss ==

=== Hagen–Poiseuille ===
Laminar flow is encountered in practice with very viscous fluids, such as motor oil, flowing through small-diameter tubes, at low velocity. Friction loss under conditions of laminar flow follow the [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]], which is an exact solution to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]]. For a circular pipe with a fluid of density ''ρ'' and viscosity ''μ'', the hydraulic slope ''S'' can be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}} \frac{V^2}{2gD} = \frac{64\nu}{2g} \frac{V}{D^2}&lt;/math&gt;
In laminar flow (that is, with Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;~2000), the hydraulic slope is proportional to the flow velocity.

=== Darcy–Weisbach ===
In many practical engineering applications, the fluid flow is more rapid, therefore turbulent rather than laminar. Under turbulent flow, the friction loss is found to be roughly proportional to the square of the flow velocity and inversely proportional to the pipe diameter, that is, the friction loss follows the phenomenological [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]] in which the ''hydraulic slope'' ''S'' can be expressed&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite conference

: &lt;math&gt;S = f_D \frac{ 1 }{ 2g } \frac{V^2}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;]] (but see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Confusion with the Fanning friction factor|''Confusion with the Fanning friction factor'']]);
: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]
Note that the value of this dimensionless factor depends on the pipe diameter ''D'' and the roughness of the pipe surface ε. Furthermore, it varies as well with the flow velocity ''V''  and on the physical properties of the fluid (usually cast together into the Reynolds number Re). Thus, the friction loss is not precisely proportional to the flow velocity squared, nor to the inverse of the pipe diameter: the friction factor takes account of the remaining dependency on these parameters.

From experimental measurements, the general features of the variation of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; are, for fixed ''relative roughness'' ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' and for Reynolds number Re = ''V'' ''D''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;ν&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;~2000,{{efn|See [[Moody chart]]}}
* With relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; declines in value with increasing Re in an approximate power law, with one order of magnitude change in ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; over four orders of magnitude in Re. This is called the "smooth pipe" regime, where the flow is turbulent but not sensitive to the roughness features of the pipe (because the vortices are much larger than those features). 
* At higher roughness, with increasing Reynolds number Re, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; climbs from its smooth pipe value, approaching an asymptote that itself varies logarithmically with the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D''; this regime is called "rough pipe" flow. 
* The point of departure from smooth flow occurs at a Reynolds number roughly inversely proportional to the value of the relative roughness: the higher the relative roughness, the lower the Re of departure. The range of Re and ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'' between smooth pipe flow and rough pipe flow is labeled "transitional". In this region, the measurements of Nikuradse show a decline in the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; with Re, before approaching its asymptotic value from below,&lt;ref name=Nikuradse1933/&gt; although Moody chose not to follow those data in his chart,&lt;ref name = Moody1944&gt;{{citation

* At values of 2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;4000, there is a ''critical zone'' of flow, a transition from laminar to turbulence, where the value of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; increases from its laminar value of 64&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Re to its smooth pipe value. In this regime, the fluid flow is found to be unstable, with vortices appearing and disappearing within the flow over time.
* The entire dependence of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; on the pipe diameter ''D'' is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness ε&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''D'', likewise the entire dependence on fluid properties density ρ and viscosity μ is subsumed into the Reynolds number Re. This is called ''scaling''.{{efn|See [[Reynolds number]]}}

[[File:Flow at Constant Friction Loss in PVC pipe.svg|thumb|Water friction loss (“hydraulic slope”) ''S'' versus flow ''Q'' for given ANSI Sch. 40 NPT PVC pipe, roughness height ''ε''  = 1.5 μm]]
In a design problem, one may select pipe for a [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Direct calculation|particular hydraulic slope ''S'' based on the candidate pipe's diameter ''D'' and its roughness ε]]. 
With these quantities as inputs, the friction factor ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed in closed form in the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation#Turbulent Regime|Colebrook–White equation or other fitting function]], and the flow volume ''Q'' and flow velocity ''V'' can be calculated therefrom.

=== Calculating Friction Loss for Air in a Duct ===
[[File:Equal-friction chart for air in metal duct (ε = 0.05mm).svg|thumb|A graphical depiction of the relationship between Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', the pressure loss per unit length of pipe, versus flow volume ''Q'', for a range of choices for pipe diameter ''D'', for air at standard temperature and pressure. Units are SI. Lines of constant Re{{radic|''f''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also shown.&lt;ref name=Elder/&gt;]]
Friction loss takes place as a gas, say air, flows through [[Duct (flow)|duct work]].&lt;ref name=Elder&gt;{{cite web
| title= Duct Design

| accessdate=8 October 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference in the character of the flow from the case of water in a pipe stems from the differing Reynolds number Re and the roughness of the duct.

The friction loss is customarily given as pressure loss for a given duct length, Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', in units of (US) inches of water for 100 feet or (SI) kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For specific choices of duct material, and assuming air at standard temperature and pressure (STP), standard charts can be used to calculate the expected friction loss.&lt;ref name=FreeCalc /&gt;&lt;ref name=PDHonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chart exhibited in this section can be used to graphically determine the required diameter of duct to be installed in an application where the volume of flow is determined and where the goal is to keep the pressure loss per unit length of duct ''S'' below some target value in all portions of the system under study. First, select the desired pressure loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'', say 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.12 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft) on the vertical axis (ordinate). Next scan horizontally to the needed flow volume ''Q'', say 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s (2000 cfm): the choice of duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.5 m (20 in.) will result in a pressure loss rate Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' less than the target value. Note in passing that selecting a duct with diameter ''D'' = 0.6 m (24 in.) will result in a loss Δ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''L'' of 0.02&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.02 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O per 100&amp;nbsp;ft), illustrating the great gains in blower efficiency to be achieved by using modestly larger ducts.

The following table gives flow rate ''Q'' such that friction loss per unit length Δ''p'' / ''L'' (SI kg / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is  0.082, 0.245, and 0.816, respectively, for a variety of nominal duct sizes. The three values chosen for friction loss correspond to, in US units inch water column per 100 feet, 0.01, .03, and 0.1. Note that, in approximation, for a given value of flow volume, a step up in duct size (say from 100mm to 120mm) will reduce the friction loss by a factor of 3.

'''FuseNet''' is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of [[nuclear fusion]] in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in [[Europe]].

== The FP7 Project ==
The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The FuseNet project started in October 2008 as a Coordination and Support Action under the [[seventh Framework Programme]], with financial support of the [[European Commission]]. The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations.

The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities.

== The Association ==
The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association.
FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.

'''Gottfried Semper''' ({{IPA-de|ˌɡɔtfriːt ˈzɛmpɐ|lang}}; 29 November 1803 – 15 May 1879) was a German architect, [[art critic]], and professor of architecture, who designed and built the [[Semperoper|Semper Oper]]a House in [[Dresden]] between 1838 and 1841. In 1849 he took part in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] and was put on the government's wanted list. Semper fled first to [[Zürich]] and later to London. Later he returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries.

Semper wrote extensively about the origins of architecture, especially in his book ''[[The Four Elements of Architecture]]'' from 1851, and he was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the [[Polychrome|polychrome architectural style]] of [[ancient Greece]]. Semper designed works at all scales, from major urban interventions like the re-design of the [[Ringstraße]] in [[Vienna]], to a baton for [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Schröder: "Nibelungenring und mystischer Knoten. Gottfried Sempers Entwurf zu einem Taktstock für Richard Wagner"  Jahrbuch des Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg,1993, P.120&lt;/ref&gt; His unrealised design for an opera house in [[Munich]] was adapted by Wagner for the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]].

== Life ==

=== Early life (to 1834) ===
Semper was born into a well-to-do industrialist family in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. The fifth of eight children, he attended the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums]] in [[Hamburg]] before starting his university education at [[Georg&amp;#45;August University of G&amp;#246;ttingen|Göttingen]] in 1823, where he studied [[historiography]] and [[mathematics]].  He subsequently studied architecture in 1825 at the [[University of Munich]] under [[Friedrich von Gärtner]].  In 1826, Semper travelled to Paris in order to work for the architect [[Franz Christian Gau]], and he was present when the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 broke out.  Between 1830 and 1833 he travelled to [[Italy]] and [[Greece]] in order to study the architecture and designs of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In 1832 he participated for four months in [[archaeology|archaeological]] research at the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens]].
During this period he became very interested in the [[Biedermeier]]-inspired [[polychromy]] debate, which centred on the question whether buildings in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had been colorfully painted or not. The drawn reconstructions of the painterly decorations of ancient villas he created in Athens inspired his later designs for the painted decorations in Dresden and Vienna. His 1834 publication ''Vorläufige Bemerkungen über bemalte Architectur und Plastik bei den Alten'' (''Preliminary Remarks on Polychrome Architecture and Sculpture in Antiquity''), in which he took a strong position in favor of polychromy - supported by his investigation of pigments on the Trajan's column in Rome - brought him sudden recognition in architectural and aesthetic circles across Europe [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-494114149741201/unrestricted/etd.pdf].

=== Dresden period (1834 - 1849) ===

[[File:Dresden Hoftheater J C A Richter.jpg|thumb|200px|Dresden, Interior of the first Hoftheater (Semper Oper)]]
On September 30, 1834 Semper obtained a post as Professor of Architecture at the [[Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden|Königlichen Akademie der bildenden Künste]] (today called the Hochschule) in Dresden thanks largely to the efforts and support of his former teacher Franz Christian Gau and swore an oath of allegiance to the King (formerly Elector) of Saxony, [[Anthony Clement of Saxony|Anthony Clement]]. The flourishing growth of Dresden during this period provided the young architect with considerable creative opportunities.  In 1838-40 a synagogue was built in Dresden to Semper's design, it was ever afterward called the [[Semper Synagogue]] and is noted for its  [[Moorish Revival]] interior style.&lt;ref&gt;H.A. Meek, The Synagogue, Phaidon, 1995, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The Synagogue's exterior was built in romanesque style so as not to call attention to itself. The interior design included not only the Moorish inspired wall decorations, but furnishings: specifically, a silver lamp of eternal light, which caught Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima's fancy. They gave a great deal of effort to have a copy of this lamp.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Eisler "Wagner's Three Synagogues", Artibus et Historiae 2004, Vol. 25/Nr. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eytan Pessen, Zusammenhängende Reliquien, eine Geschichte über Richard Wagner und Gottfried Semper, pp. 1-22, Semperoper Dresden, Erchien in Wagnerjahr 2013, Spielzeit 2012-2013 &amp; 2013-2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Semper's student, [[Otto Simonson]] would construct the magnificent [[Moorish Revival]] [[Leipzig synagogue]] in 1855.

[[File:Denkmal für Gottfried Semper 1887 Ki 00042-02.tif|thumb|left|150px|Monument for Gottfried Semper (1887)]]
Certain civic structures remain today, such as the Elbe-facing [[Semper Gallery|gallery]] of the [[Zwinger Palace]] complex. His first building for the Dresden Hoftheater burnt down, and the second, today called the [[Semperoper]], was built in 1841.  Other buildings also remain indelibly attached to his name, such as the Maternity Hospital, the Synagogue (destroyed during the Third Reich), the Oppenheim Palace, and the ''Villa Rosa'' built for the banker Martin Wilhelm Oppenheim.  This last construction stands as a prototype of German villa architecture.

On September 1, 1835 Semper married Bertha Thimmig. The marriage ultimately produced six children.

A convinced Republican, Semper took a leading role, along with his friend [[Richard Wagner]], in the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May 1849 uprising]] which swept over the city .  He was a member of the Civic Guard (Kommunalgarde) and helped to erect barricades in the streets.  When the rebellion collapsed, Semper was considered a leading agitator for democratic change and a ringleader against government authority and he was forced to flee the city.

He was destined never to return to the city that would, ironically, become most associated with his architectural (and political) legacy.  The Saxon government maintained a warrant for his arrest until 1863.  When the Semper-designed Hoftheater  burnt down in 1869, King [[John I of Saxony|John]], on the urging of the citizenry, commissioned Semper to build a new one.  Semper produced the plans, but left the actual construction to his son, Manfred.

"What must I have done in 48, that one persecutes me forever? One single barricade did I construct - it held, because it was practical, and as it was practical, it was beautiful", wrote Semper in dismay.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinrich Hübsch, January 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-revolutionary period (1849 - 1855) ===

After stays in [[Zwickau]], [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Strasbourg]], Semper eventually ended up back in Paris, like many other disillusioned Republicans from the 1848 Revolutions (such as [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne]]).  In the fall of 1850, he travelled to London, England.  But while he was able to pick up occasional contracts — including participation in the design of the funeral carriage for the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and the designs of the Canadian, Danish, Swedish, and Ottoman sections of the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] — he found no steady employment.  If his stay in London was disappointing professionally, however, it proved a fertile period for Semper's theoretical, creative and academic development.  He published ''Die vier Elemente der Baukunst'' (''[[The Four Elements of Architecture]]'') in 1851 and ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' (''Science, Industry and Art'') in 1852.  These works would ultimately provide the groundwork for his most widely regarded publication, ''Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik,'' which was published in two volumes in 1861 and 1863.&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book

=== Zürich period (1855 - 1871) ===

[[File:Winterthur Stadthaus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Stadthaus'' (city hall) [[Winterthur]]]]
Concurrently with the onset of the industrial revolution, the [[Swiss Federation]] planned to establish a [[Institute of technology|polytechnical]] school.  As the principal judge for the [[architectural design competition|competition]] held to select a design for the new building, Semper deemed the submitted entries unsatisfactory and, ultimately, designed the building himself.  Proudly situated (where fortified walls once stood), visible from all sides on a terrace overlooking the core of [[Zurich]], the new school became a symbol of a new epoch. The building (1853–1864), which despite frequent remodeling continues to evoke Semper's concept, was initially required to accommodate not only the new school (known today as the [[ETH Zurich]]), but the existing [[University of Zurich]], as well.

In 1855 Semper became a professor of architecture at the new school and the success of many of his students who attained success and renown served to ensure his legacy.  The Swiss architect [[Emil Schmid]] was one such student.  With his income as a professor, Semper was able to reunite his family, bringing them to Zurich from Saxony. The City Hall in [[Winterthur]] is among other buildings designed by Semper in Switzerland.

Semper provided [[Bavaria]]'s [[King Ludwig II]] with a conceptual design for a theatre dedicated to the work of [[Richard Wagner]] to be built in Munich.  The project, developed from 1864 to 1866, was never realized, although Wagner 'borrowed' many of its features for his own later theatre at [[Bayreuth]].

=== Later life (from 1871) ===
[[File:Friedhof Piramide - Grab Semper.jpg|thumb|left|Semper's grave in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]]]]
[[File:Gottfried Semper 1879.jpg|right|thumb|[[Franz von Lenbach]]'s portrait of  Gottfried Semper shortly before his death]]

Already in 1833 there were first plans in Vienna for the public presentation of the Imperial Art Collections. With the planning of the [[Vienna Ring Road]], the museum question became pressing again. Works forming the imperial art collection were scattered among several buildings. Semper was assigned to submit a proposal for locating new buildings in conjunction with redevelopment of the Ring Road. In 1869 he designed a gigantic 'Imperial Forum' which was not realized.  The National Museum of Art History and the National Museum of Natural History were erected, however, opposite the Palace according to his plan, as was the Burgtheater.  In 1871 Semper moved to Vienna to undertake the projects.
During construction, repeated disagreements with his appointed associate architect ([[Baron Karl von Hasenauer|Karl Freiherr von Hasenauer]]), led Semper to resign from the project in 1876.  In the following year his health began to deteriorate.  He died two years later while on a visit to Italy and is buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]].

'''Grave robbery''', '''tomb robbing''', or '''tomb raiding''' is the act of uncovering a [[grave (burial)|grave]], [[tomb]] or [[crypt]] to steal matter. It is usually perpetrated to take and profit from valuable [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s or [[personal property|personal effects]].{{Refn|group=n|All three long-used terms bear their [[plain meaning rule|plain (natural) meaning]], specifically that robbing and raiding in this context mean stealing. In English, Welsh and Scottish law "to rob"/"robbery" is limited to an intentional fright or attack against a person so as to steal - i.e. some form of [[assault and battery (disambiguation)|assault or battery]]. In more common colloquial use the term "rob" is also used transitively with any type of place meaning to steal from. This means that, internationally, stealing of coffins/urns containing remains, components of these items or taking bodies from their proper, intended final resting place is also caught by the term}} A related act is [[body snatching]], a term denoting the contested or unlawful taking of a body (seldom from a grave), which can be extended to the unlawful taking of organs alone. These acts carry two [[social stigma|stigma]]s from the [[evolution of morality]]: [[selfishness]] and [[psychological trauma]] to which the [[behavioural immune system]] adds the stigma of [[disgust]] to those coming into contact with part-decayed, particularly human, bodies.

Grave robbing has caused great difficulty to the study of [[archaeology]], [[art history]], and [[history]].{{sfnp|Daniel|1950|p=11|ps=}}{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=9|ps=}} Countless precious grave sites and tombs have been robbed before scholars were able to examine them. In any way, the archaeological context and the historical and anthropological information are destroyed:

{{quote|Looting obliterates the memory of the ancient world and turns its highest artistic creations into decorations, adornments on a shelf, divorced from historical context and ultimately from all meaning.{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=10|ps=}}}}
Grave robbers who are not caught usually sell relatively modern items anonymously and artifacts on the [[black market]]. Those intercepted, in a public justice domain, are inclined to deny their guilt due to the three stigmas mentioned. Though some artifacts may make their way to museums or scholars, the majority end up in private collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.5 | issue=45 | title=The Insta-Dead: The rhetoric of the human remains trade on Instagram | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Huffer | first1 = Damien | last2 = University | first2 = Stockholm | last3 = Graham | first3 = Shawn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on archaeology around the world==

===China===
{{pull quote|Tomb raiding is already a full-fledged industry in China.|source='''Xie Zhensheng'''{{when|date=February 2018}}, honorary president, China Cultural Relics Society}}

Chinese [[jade burial suits]] were believed to be myths for many years until two were discovered in 1968; it is now believed that most jade burial suits were removed long ago by grave robbers.

Grave robbing is still problematic in 21st century China. The increase in technology, such as night vision goggles, air breathing equipment, and metal detectors allows grave robbers to better find and rob ancient gravesites. There are institutions in which you can learn how to rob graves– “for about 200 yuan (about $30) a day. Land surveying skills are first taught, before progressing to probes and shovels, then finally explosives. After 10 days, adepts have the chance to assist an instructor in a real tomb robbery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fang|first1=Frank|last2=Ong|first2=Larry|title=China Fights Losing Battle Against Tomb Raiders|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1993683-china-fights-losing-battle-against-tomb-raiders/|publisher=Epoch Times|accessdate=6 August 2016|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs are one of the most common examples of tomb or grave robbery. Most of the tombs in Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]] were robbed within one hundred years of their sealing (including the tomb of the famous King [[Tutankhamen]], which was raided at least twice before it was discovered in 1922).{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=147|ps=}} As most of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in these ancient burial sites have been discovered, it is through the conditions of the tombs and presumed articles that are missing in which historians and archaeologists are able to determine whether the tomb has been robbed. Egyptian [[pharaohs]] often kept records of the precious items in their tombs, so an inventory check is presumed for archaeologists.{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=244|ps=}} Oftentimes, warnings would be left by the Pharaohs in the tombs of calamities and curses that would be laid upon any who touched the treasure, or the bodies, which did little to deter grave robbers. There are many examples of grave robbing in the Ancient World outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name="NG 6-2016"&gt;{{cite magazine| last= Mueller| first = Tom| date = June 2016| title= How Tomb Raiders Are Stealing Our History| url  = https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/06/looting-ancient-blood-antiquities/| magazine   = National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans ([[Byzantium]]) also suffered decades of theft and destruction of tombs, crypts, and graves.{{sfnp|Shelton|1998|p=95|ps=}}

=== Europe ===
In Europe, graves are robbed on an accelerating and alarming scale. Many grave robbers works with metal detectors and some of the groups are [[organised crime|organised criminals]], feeding the black market with highly prized archaeological artifacts.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/archaeology-in-crisis-bulgaria-plagued-by-grave-robbers-a-524976.html|title=Bulgaria Plagued by 'Grave Robbers'|author=Marion Kraske|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Merovingian]] graves in France and Germany and [[Anglo-Saxon]] graves in England contain many metal grave goods, mostly of iron. Grave robbers often leave them, being only interested in gold and silver. Grave contexts, ceramics, iron weapons and skeletons are destroyed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Southeast Europe]] and the European part of [[Russia]], grave robbers target all kinds of historically important graves, from pre-historic tombs to World War II graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-latvia-nazi-memorabilia/|title=Rise of the Nazi-Grave Robbers|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date= 23 August 2016|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/344760/Grave-robbing-ghouls-who-trade-in-Nazi-relics|title=Grave robbing ghouls who trade in Nazi relics|publisher=Sunday Express|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

===North America===
Modern grave robbing in North America also involves long-abandoned or forgotten private [[Antebellum Period]] to pre-[[Great Depression]] era grave sites. These sites are often desecrated by grave robbers in search of old, hence valuable, jewelry. Affected sites are typically in rural, forested areas where once-prominent, wealthy landowners and their families were interred. The remote and often undocumented locations of defunct private cemeteries make them particularly susceptible to grave robbery. The practice may be encouraged by default upon the discovery of a previously unknown family cemetery by a new landowner.

One historical incident occurred during the evening of November 7, 1876, when a group of counterfeiters tried to abscond with [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s mortal remains from his grave in [[Springfield, Illinois]], in order to secure the release of their imprisoned leader, counterfeit engraver Benjamin Boyd. However, a secret service agent was present and had notified the police beforehand, so the attempted grave robbers only succeeded in the dislodgment of the lid of his coffin. As a consequence, when reburied, additional security measures prevented further depredations against Lincoln's body {{sfnp|Craughwell|2007|p=|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Keith Verinese: "The Adventures of Abraham Lincoln's Corpse:" http://io9.com/S898746/the-adventures-of-abraham-lincolns-corpse{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central America===
Grave robbers often sold stolen [[Aztec]] or [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] goods on the [[black market]] for an extremely high price. The buyers (museum curators, historians, etc.) did not often suffer the repercussions of being in possession of stolen goods and that the blame (and charges) are put upon the lower-class grave robbers. Today's [[antiquities trade]] has become a streamlining industry&amp;nbsp;– and the speed these artifacts enter the market has grown exponentially. Laws have been enacted in these regions, but due to extreme poverty, these grave robbings continue to grow each year.

==Race==

===African Americans===
[[Image:Leonard Medical School graduating class of 1889.JPG|thumb|Leonard Medical School Graduating Class of 1889]]
{{pull quote|Enslaved and free African Americans, immigrants, and the poor were frequently the target of grave robbing.|source='''Edward C. Halperin'''}}

African Americans would often bury their dead in a [[potter's field]]; not having the access or money for a proper funeral. When buried in potter’s fields, the dead were not normally buried very deep. A grave robber could just wait in the distance until everyone left and dig up the body from its shallow grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of African-American Cemeteries|url=http://www.sciway.net/hist/chicora/gravematters-1.html|website=www.sciway.net|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the railroad was invented and tracks laid—the sale of African American slaves from the South for dissection began; being sent to medical schools in the northern part of the United States. One Professor of Anatomy in New England reported that, in the 1880s and 1890s, he entered into an arrangement in which he received, twice each semester, a shipment of 12 bodies of southern African Americans. “They came in barrels labeled turpentine and were shipped to a local hardware store that dealt in painting materials”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waite|first1=Frederick C.|title=Grave robbing in New England|date=1945|publisher=Public Library of Fort Wayne and Allen County|accessdate=31 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Emancipation Act]], African American Union soldiers that died while serving in the military were dissected by white military surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitt|first1=Todd L.|title=Slave Life Insurance in Virginia and North Carolina|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=November 1977|volume=43|issue=4|pages=583|doi=10.2307/2207007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State laws in Mississippi and North Carolina were passed in the 19th century which allowed medical schools to use the remains of those at the bottom of society’s hierarchy—the unclaimed bodies of poor persons, residents of alms houses, and those buried in potter’s fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Ruth|title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute|date=2000|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226712406|edition=2 ed. with a new afterword.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=DC|title=Dissection and Discrimination: the Social Origins of Cadavers in America, 1760-1915.|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date=September 1973|volume=49|issue=9|pages=819–27|pmid=4582559|pmc=1807060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option to dissect Confederate soldiers was also not available, being that Mississippi and North Carolina legally released the bodies to the families. The North Carolina law also provided that the body of whites never be sent to an African American medical college (such as the Leonard Medical School). These African American Medical schools typically obtained unclaimed Black ‘‘potter’s field bodies’’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Wendy|title=The Knife Man : Blood, Body Snatching, and the Birth of Modern Surgery|date=2005|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0767916530|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterrents ==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Mount Auburn Cemetery terrain.jpg|thumb|Examples of the terrain within [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]
The geography and placement of burial grounds became a deterrent within itself. This is because without the accessibility of the automobile (in the early 19th century), the transportation of bodies was difficult.

A perfect example of this is Mount Auburn Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery|url=http://mountauburn.org/|website=mountauburn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cambridge Massachusetts. It was the first [[rural cemetery]] inside the United States. The rural location of the cemetery created transportation issues. In addition, the terrain of and around the cemetery was formidable. Further, [[Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn]], the designer wanted to leave the natural terrain (including ponds and hills) within the cemetery. If someone wanted to rob a grave they would have to maneuver around these obstacles for over large stretches of land, while in the dark. Note that [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] is over 175 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery--Massachusetts Conservation: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/mount_auburn.html|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cemeteries, of the time, that were originally built away from populated areas for similar reasons, include: [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Bangor, Maine)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Bangor, Maine (1834); [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1836); [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery (Taunton, Massachusetts)|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Taunton, Massachusetts (1836); [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Rochester, New York (1838); [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in Brooklyn, New York (1838); and, [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in Baltimore, Maryland (1838).

===Mortsafes===
[[Image:Mortsafe at Logeriat Church1.jpg|thumb|Mortsafes at Logeriat Church in [[Perthshire, Scotland]]]]
A [[mortsafe]] or mort safe was an iron coffin or framework which helped to protect a grave by preventing the body from being dug up and taken away. Mortsafes were specific for the task of preventing bodies from being stolen for purposes of medical dissections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennox|first1=Suzie|title=Bodysnatchers: Digging Up The Untold Stories of Britain's Resurrection Men|publisher=Pen and Sword History|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|isbn=9781473866577|page=39,65}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterrents, used commonly in Scotland, would be only available for the rich to protect their loved ones, since iron was so expensive. After the body would decompose to a certain extent, the Mortsafe would be removed. These were not a commodity that were sold and bought; rather, they were rented.

===Mort houses===
[[Image:Udny Mort House 02.JPG|thumb|[[Udny Mort House]] in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland]]

A mort house or [[dead house]] was used to store bodies until decomposed enough to no longer be targets for grave robbing. Up to 31 recorded mort houses were scattered throughout Scotland and northern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorman|first1=Martyn|title=Map Showing the Distribution of Morthouses in Scottish Graveyards|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/bodysnatchers/morthouses.php|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually these structures were built within or near cemeteries to make transportation easier. Prior to grave robbers, they were used to store dead bodies in the winter, being that the ground was too cold and in some cases impossible to dig into. An example is the [[Udny Mort House]] built in 1832, Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland and still standing today.

===Coffin collars===
The coffin collar was an iron collar often fixed to a piece of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums of Scotland - Coffin Collar|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-000-830-C|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was fixed around the neck of a corpse and then bolted to the bottom of a coffin. Most common reports of these collars being used came from Scotland around the 1820s.

===Family mausoleums===
[[Image:Freeland Grave.png|thumb|The Freeland Mausoleum at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
Historically [[mausoleums]] have been used as a sign of a family’s wealth and a symbol of gentry and nobility in many countries. In the mid and late 19th century in North America, more and more families began to buy mausoleums. The belief was that it would be easier for a Resurrectionist or grave robber to dig up a grave rather than to topple down iron or steel doors guarding the mausoleum. A flaw in the design of the mausoleum was the stained glass or other windows within. Almost every family between the 18th and 19th century had a religious affiliation. As such, many of these families (usually with a Christian affiliation) would put stained glass within the mausoleums. The grave robbers would then just have to smash the glass to break in and to retrieve the body. Making it even easier, around the 1830s families began to fear burying family members. The living relatives would stand guard inside the mausoleum and would sometimes get trapped—only to be discovered upon the death of the next family member [citation needed]. To remedy this, families would put a spare key somewhere within the mausoleum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mausoleum Locks (19th &amp; 20th century)|url=http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326223519/http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|archivedate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create doors with two way locks. In short, grave robbers could break a window, recover the body, find the key, and walk straight out the front door of the mausoleum.

===Guards/guarding===
One of the most simplistic and low-tech methods to prevent grave robbing were to have an individual guard over the newly buried body. This was done until decomposition of the body was brought to a point where they would no longer be desirable for medical use. If families did not have enough money to hire an individual to watch over the grave for a select number of days, the family would delegate this duty amongst them and close friends. As grave robbing became a lucrative business in the 19th century, a bribe would convince some guards to look the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Lauren|title=8 Ways to Keep Body Snatchers from Stealing Your Corpse|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/8-ways-to-keep-body-snatchers-from-stealing-your-corpse-1444488983|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deception===
Within the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (completed around 2560 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Pyramid of Giza: Last Remaining Wonder of the Ancient World|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/124/|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Egyptian deterrent system was built to guard the tomb of [[Pharaoh Khufu]]. This system consists of blocks and grooves to protect the King’s Chamber from tomb robbers. Some experts believe that Pharaoh Khufu’s tomb has actually not been found because of the deterrent system; instead, what had been found by grave robbers were fake rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title='Primitive Machine' Within Great Pyramid of Giza Reconstructed|url=http://www.livescience.com/55347-primitive-machine-in-great-pyramid-protected-pharaoh.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB's head office is located in [[Moscow, Russia]].

== History ==
[[File:Ilya Sachkov.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ilya Sachkov]], the founder]]
Group-IB was founded in 2003 by a group of students of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]], headed by [[Ilya Konstantinovich Sachkov]]. They were acting as an agency for investigating cyber-attacks. Since then, Group-IB has been involved in a range of incident response and investigations across the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-atms-idUSKBN14P0CX |title=Taiwan ATM heist linked to European hacking spree: security firm |author=Jim Finkle and J.R. Wu |date=January 5, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; actively cooperating with international partners to detect perpetrators and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/940-group-ib-supports-interpol-in-disrupting-dorkbot-botnet |title=Group-IB supports INTERPOL in disrupting Dorkbot botnet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=December 17, 2015 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB participated in the first successful [[cybercrime]] case in Russia where the organizers of the criminal groups were identified and arrested. These criminals were involved in financial theft from bank accounts using [[malware]] for PCs, mobile devices, [[phishing]] attacks, and targeted attacks on financial institutions in Russia. The company is generally involved in a series of international operations and leverages close cooperation with international law enforcement agencies to get the criminals wherever they hide. According to Group-IB, up to 80% of all high-profile investigation cases in the field of high-tech crime in Russia are supported by Group-IB experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/about.html |title=About Group-IB |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote="80% of high-profile cybercrimes in Russia and CIS are investigated by Group-IB"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Group-IB established the largest computer [[forensics]] laboratory in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/russian-police-bust-alleged-bank-malware-gang-a-9163 |title=Russian Police Bust Alleged Bank Malware Gang |last=Schwartz |first=Mathew J. |date=June 2, 2016 |website=bankinfosecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company established its [[Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT)—the first round-the-clock computer security incident response team in Eastern Europe, called CERT-GIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2032336/researchers-find-new-pointofsale-malware-called-blackpos.html |title=Researchers find new point-of-sale malware called BlackPOS |last=Lucian |first=Constantin |date=March 28, 2013 |website=pcworld.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the status of a Competent Security Organization recognized by [[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] (administrator of the national top-level domains [[.ru]] and [[.рф]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cctld.ru/en/news/news_detail.php?ID=3366&amp;sphrase_id=138576 |title=Group-IB to help combating cibercrime in domains .РФ and .RU |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011-12-23 |website= |publisher=[[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaboration with CERTs worldwide, the company has developed a series of effective [[intellectual property]] protection services.

Group-IB successfully protected the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Olympic]] brand, products and ticket sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.ru/testimonials/sochi.pdf |title=Sochi 2014 Commemorative certificate |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |access-date= |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocked pirated links to TV series and movies owned by [[Sony Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Fox TV]] series', [[Discovery Channel]], Amedia (which has exclusive rights to HBO TV series in Russia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/828-internet-criminalists-how-russias-main-cyber-detective-agency-is-organized |title=Internet criminalists: how Russia’s main cyber detective agency is organized |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fraudulent websites abusing brands of popular banks and payment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/qiwi_i_groupib_obedinili_usiliya_dlya |title=Qiwi и Group-IB объединили усилия для защиты электронных платежей |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-04-10 |website=cnews.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Group-IВ has been developing their Early Warning System to provide cyber defence to companies around the world. In 2015 [[Gartner]] included Group-IB's core product—Group-IB Intelligence—in the top 7 global threat intelligence solutions along with products developed by [[IBM]], [[FireEye]], [[RSA Security|RSA]] and [[Check Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2874317/market-guide-security-threat-intelligence |title=Market Guide for Security Threat Intelligence Services |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=14 October 2014 |website= |publisher=[[Gartner]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Group-IB has been cooperating with [[Microsoft]]. In 2015, the two companies presented joint research on the economic impact of cyber-attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/business/2016/04/14/russia-loses-33-billion-to-cyber-attacks_584971 |title=Russia loses $3.3 billion to cyber attacks |last=Kuchma |first=Anna |date=April 14, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB is a resident of the Moscow-based [[Skolkovo Foundation]] (dubbed "Russian [[Silicon Valley]]"). As part of Skolkovo innovative projects, Group-IB created the so-called "CyberCop", a global counter-cybercrime system.

The company has also established an additional office in [[Innopolis]]—a [[science park]] in [[Tatarstan]], Russia.

== Owners and leadership ==
In 2010, LETA Group, an investment and management company in information technology, acquired 50% of Group-IB's assets. In 2013, Group-IB management bought out LETA Group's share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.leta.vc/news/menedzhment-group-ib/ |title= Group-IB management buys out LETA Group’s share|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=5 November 2013 |website= |publisher=LETA Group |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2016 Russian-founded Altera Capital and Run Capital each bought a 10 percent stake in Group-IB.

According to the company's announcement, Group-IB will leverage these investments to develop products and create [[R&amp;D]] hubs in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as to hire local forensic specialists and improve sales performance at the American, European, and Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vc.ru/n/group-invest |title=Российские специалисты по информбезопасности Group-IB продали 20% компании фондам Altera и Run Capital |last=Фролов |first=Андрей |date=2016-08-15 |website=vc.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
According to Gartner, "being involved in the most high-profile investigations allows Group-IB to get more information about cybercriminals, their relationships and other intelligence".&lt;ref name="Gartner" /&gt; In addition to investigation materials and forensics expertise, GIB's threat data collection is based on the high-tech infrastructure that includes:
* compromised data tracking and data extraction from [[botnet]]s; automatic search and monitoring of "underground" forums;
* vast databases of known cyber criminals and gangs that identify intersections and analyzes [[social graphs]];
* identification of new threats using behavioral analysis and machine learning technology;
* detection of infections, attempts of remote control and other indications of fraud schemes targeting clients of [[online banking]] and Internet portals without installation on client devices;
* detection of [[phishing]] resources and rogue mobile applications and extraction of their phishing kits—modules designed to store and transmit stolen data.

=== Early Warning System for Cyber Defence ===

GIB Intelligence service uses personalized information for security strategy planning, making time-sensitive decisions and tweaking protection tools. It gives time for incidents prevention allowing to urgently discover theft of clients and employees' identifiers, to track modifications of tactics and tools used by criminal groups potentially interested in a company and to prioritize threats based on expert [[Forecasting|forecast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml?18/34/85 |title=Российские киберпреступники получили в 2013 г. почти $2,5 млрд |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-10-15 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TDS is a hardware and software unit preventing infection and vulnerabilities usage in corporate networks. The TDS sensors track suspicious activities in a corporate network while the CERT-GIB experts reveal critical threats and immediately inform the information security service and help to put a stop to an incident evolving. TDS Polygon allows to start in an isolated environ suspicious [[Computer file|file]]s downloaded by users or received in mail and to obtain an objective conclusion of the degree of their harmfulness based on a classification formed through computerized training pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Market_Analysis/protection-market-against-targeted-attacks-review |title=Обзор рынка защиты от целевых атак |author=Иван Бойцов |date=2016-10-26 |website=anti-malware.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major threats detected by Group-IB ==

=== Lazarus: state-sponsored attack ===
In May 2017 Group-IB issued a report that proved there is a connection between Lazarus group who stole $18 mln from [[Bangladesh Bank|Bangladesh Central Bank]], conducted a number of attacks on Polish banks, as well as attempted to infect hundreds of financial organizations in 30 countries around the globe, including European Central Bank, Central Banks of Russia, Brazil and Venezuela – with North Korea. Company experts made a research of the complex technological infrastructure, communications channels, and concealment techniques, presented new evidence of Lazarus attribution to North Korea and revealed details of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/30/nork_spy_agency_lazarus_group_attribution/ |title=NORK spy agency blamed for Bangladesh cyberheist, Sony Pictures hack |last=Leyden |first=John |date=30 May 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Register]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt: logical attacks===
In July 2016, a group of masked cyber-criminals "jackpotted" 34 ATMs operated by First Bank, one of Taiwan's largest banks. The perpetrators stole T$83.27 (over $2m USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/thai-bank-shuts-down-half-its-atms-after-eastern-european-cyber-gang-heist-1577806 |title=Thai bank shuts down half its ATMs after 'Eastern European cyber-gang' heist |last=Murdock |first=Jason |date=August 24, 2016 |website= |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Surveillance footage|CCTV footage]], the thieves used cellphones to trigger the ATMs to automatically dispense money. Group-IB experts were the first to discover the "jackpotting" attack tactics used by the Cobalt gang to force ATMs to spit out cash using malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atms-idUSKBN13G24Q?il=0 |title=Hackers target ATMs across Europe as cyber threat grows |last=Finkle |first=Jim |date=2016-11-21 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group-IB released a report "Cobalt: Logical attacks on ATMs" that provided a detailed analysis of the attack scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/cobalt.html |title=Cobalt: logical attacks on ATMs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get into the bank's internal network, hackers used spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The emails purported to come from the European Central Bank, the ATM maker [[Wincor Nixdorf]], and local banks. After establishing control over the bank's internal network, the criminals searched for network segments, from which they could gain access to ATMs and workstations of bank employees who control ATMs. Once access to ATMs was obtained, they uploaded a specific software to them, allowing criminals to control cash dispensers.

===Corkow===
In February 2016, Group-IB published a report titled "Analysis of attacks against trading and bank card systems" about the first major successful attack on a trading system provoking major exchange volatility. In February 2015, the Corkow criminal group infected a trading system terminal of [[Kazan]]-based Energobank using a specialized [[Trojan software]] resulting in trades of more than $400 million. The hackers moved the ruble-dollar rate more than 15 percent in minutes on the [[Moscow Exchange]]. The bank claimed losses of 244 million rubles ($3.2 million) due to the trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says |title=Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware, Group-IB Says |last= |first= |date=2016-02-08 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buhtrap===
In March 2016 Group-IB published a report on activity of the Buhtrap criminal group that managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 million) from August 2015 to February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/articles/2016/03/18/634123-hakeri-rossiiskih-bankov |title=Хакеры украли $25 млн у 13 российских банков |last=Kantyshev |first=Pavel |date=2016-03-18 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high effectiveness of these attacks was achieved due to spear phishing mailouts, including those sent acting as the [[Central Bank of Russia]], which were used by criminals to gain access to the corporate network. Criminals obtained access to computers running the Automated Working Station of the Central Bank Client (AWS CBC), a free software that delivers payment documents on behalf of the Central Bank, and performed fraudulent transactions acting as the bank. The attack scheme outlined in the report published by Group-IB was later used to perform thefts via SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-17/new-russian-hacker-cell-hit-13-banks-since-august-group-ib-says |title=New Russian Hacker Cell Hit 13 Banks Since August, Group-IB Says |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-03-17 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buhtrap was the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increased the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks had to shut down the whole infrastructure, because the worm was able to gain full control over the network using a single infected machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/buhtrap-report.html |title=Buhtrap: the evolution of targeted attacks against financial institutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anunak/Carbanak===
In late 2014 Fox-IT and Group-IB jointly released a report on the Anunak (aka Carbanak) hacker group that had stolen more than 1 billion rubles from over 50 Russian banks. In Europe Anunak attacked [[Point of sale|POS terminals]] of large retail store chains with data of several million clients infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/276227-brat-po-krupnomu-kak-odna-gruppirovka-khakerov-ograbila-bolee-50 |title=Брать по-крупному: группировка хакеров ограбила более 50 банков |author=Pavel Sedakov, Dmitry Filonov |date=2014-12-22 |website= |publisher=[[Forbes]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has not performed successful thefts since early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/939-high-tech-crime-trends-2015 |title=High-Tech Crime Trends 2015 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse ATM Attack===
In autumn 2015,  a novel technique of targeted attacks called a "reverse ATM attack" that allowed criminals to steal money from ATMs. "[[Money mule]]s" (criminal payment agents) would deposit small sums into unembossed cards with legitimate accounts, immediately withdrawing what they'd put in. They also took a receipt from the ATM, which contained a payment reference number and the amount withdrawn. That information was sent to hackers who would use the data and their access to thousands of point of sale terminals, primarily based in the USA and the Czech Republic, to create "a reversal operation" on a terminal that tricked the bank into believing the withdrawal of funds had been cancelled. At the point of sale terminal, this looked as though goods were returned or a payment was declined, whilst to the banks it appeared the ATM withdrawal had been cancelled. Funds were returned to the account, though the perpetrators had already taken the cash. The process was repeated until there was no money remaining in the target ATM. During these attacks criminals managed to steal 252 million rubles ($3.8 million) from five large Russian banks. The fraud can no longer be perpetrated due to additional security systems implemented by banks with the assistance from VISA and Mastercard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42272/cyber-crime/reverse-atm-hack-method.html |title=Russian criminals Steal $4 Million In cash with a new technique dubbed reverse ATM Attack. |last=Paganini |first=Paganini |date=November 26, 2015 |website=securityaffairs.co |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISIS  hacker attacks on Russian resources===
According to the report released by Group-IB in March 2015, hackers from the self-proclaimed [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) attacked 600 Russian Internet resources in 2014. Criminals primarily [[Website defacement|defaced]] websites placing pictures and video with ISIS propaganda. Hackers are believed to have attacked not only government organizations, banks and popular resources, but also galleries and schools. These attacks were chaotic and massive; researchers believe that they were aimed to gain experience and perform reconnaissance of the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet]]. According to Group-IB's report, these attacks were performed not just by ISIS cyber division, [[Islamic State Hacking Division|Cyber Caliphate]], but by 3 more criminal groups called Team System Dz, FallaGa Team and Global Islamic Caliphate totalling over 40 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237031-isis-hackers-have-hit-hundreds-of-russian-websites |title=ISIS hackers have hit hundreds of Russian websites |last=Bennett |first=Cory |date= |website= |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable public investigations ==

===Exploits: Blackhole (Paunch)===
In Autumn 2013 Group-IB supported investigative activity that resulted in the arrest of Dmitry Fedotov, known under the nickname Paunch, the author of the infamous [[Blackhole exploit kit|Blackhole exploit pack]], which was, at the time, used to conduct 40% of infections worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/who-is-paunch/ |title=Who Is Paunch? |last= |first= |date=December 2013 |website=krebsonsecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal was sentenced to 7 years in prison according to the national legislation in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/blackholes-paunch-sentenced-to-7/ |title=Blackhole's Paunch Sentenced to 7 Years in Russian Penal Colony |last=Seals |first=Tara |date=2016-04-19 |website=infosecurity-magazine.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on legal entities: Carberp, Germes, Hodprot===
In 2012 law enforcement agencies, with assistance from Sberbank and Group-IB, arrested the largest criminal gang in Russia. In two years, the group managed to infect over 1.5 million computers worldwide and steal approximately $250 million from bank accounts. In total, over 100 banks suffered from their attacks throughout the world. Group-IB engaged their partners in the Netherlands and Canada in the investigation, which enabled the company to identify the full chain of actors including the organizer, who owned the [[botnet]], operators, and cashers ("[[money mule]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/627-members-of-the-largest-criminal-group-engaged-in-online-banking-fraud-are-detained |title=Members of the largest criminal group engaged in online banking fraud are detained |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first case in Russia when all members of the criminal group were arrested; the leaders were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityweek.com/russian-authorities-claim-capture-mastermind-behind-carberp-banking-trojan |title=Russian Authorities Claim Capture of Mastermind Behind Carberp Banking Trojan |author=Fahmida Y. Rashid |date=April 4, 2013 |website=securityweek.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year members of other criminal groups, who used Carberp modifications to attack individuals and companies, were arrested. In the summer of 2012 a hacker known as Germes (aka Arashi) was arrested. He was a creator of one of the largest global botnets that had infected over 6 million computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.com.au/article/428671/russian_carberp_botnet_kingpin_arrested_/ |title=Russian Carberp botnet kingpin arrested |author=Liam Tung |date=June 26, 2012 |website=cso.com.au |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, 7 members of the Hodprot criminal group were detained. One of the oldest Russian hacker gangs is known to have stolen approximately 125 million rubles from Russian bank accounts. All members of the criminal group were arrested, even though they are known to have used control servers located abroad – in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/06/04/carberp-and-hodprot-six-more-gang-members-held/ |title=Carberp and Hodprot: six more gang members held |last=Harley |first=David |date=2012-06-04 |website=welivesecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android Trojans: "5th Reich", WapLook, Cron===
In April 2015 members of a hacker group, which had infected over 340,000 Android-based devices to steal money from bank accounts, were arrested with assistance of Group-IB and Sberbank. Hackers dubbed their malware "the fifth [[Reich]]" and used Nazi symbols in the control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2015-04-13/kiber-fashisty-iz-chelyabinskoy-oblasti-ispolzovali-virus-5-reyh |title=Кибер-фашисты из Челябинской области использовали вирус "5 рейх" |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-04-13 |website= |publisher=[[REN TV]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers distributed the malware via SMS messages containing a link to download a program masked as [[Adobe Flash Player]]. The Trojan enabled hackers to intercept SMS notifications from banks and furtively confirm money transfer to hackers' accounts. The attack scheme was similar to that used by WapLook, the first criminal group members which were arrested for money theft from individuals using malicious mobile apps in Russia. Group leaders were arrested in September 2014 with assistance from Group-IB. In May 2017 Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrest of Cron gang that had infected more than 1 mln smartphones. Group-IB provided expert support to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-banks-idUSKBN18I0VE |title=Hackers hit Russian bank customers, planned international cyber raids |last=Stubbs |first=Jack |date=2017-05-22 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cron Banking Trojan spread itself in two ways—via SMS, when the user clicked on the link in the message and installed a malicious application, or disguised as a legitimate application Navitel, Framaroot, Pornhub, Avito etc. The hackers infected up to 3,500 smartphones daily, and managed to steal about $1 mln in total.

===Phishing: Popelysh brothers===
In June 2015, twin brother hackers were reportedly arrested in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], as part of a police operation assisted by Group-IB. Over 4 years, the Popelysh brothers had stolen money from client accounts of [[VTB Bank|VTB24]] online banking using a fake bank page to grab client data. This was the first case in Russia, when legal proceedings were taken against criminals using phishing schemes.

 {{main|Harold Adams Innis}}
'''[[Harold Innis|Harold Adams Innis]]''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on Canadian economic history and on media and [[communication theory]]. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach." In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History.'' Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis's communications writings explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis." In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But he warned that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications theories==
===Time and space===

{{quote|Improvements in communication...make for increased difficulties of understanding.|Harold Innis|''The Bias of Communication''&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 28. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Harold Innis's primary contributions to the field of communications was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased  types. Time-biased media include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s, [[manuscript|hand-copied manuscripts ]] on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] and oral sources such as [[Homer|Homer's]] epic poems. These are intended to carry stories and messages that last for many generations, but tend to reach limited audiences. Space-biased media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers that convey information to many people over long distances, but have short exposure times. While time-biased media favour stability, community, tradition and religion, space-biased media facilitate rapid change, materialism, secularism and empire. Innis elaborated on his distinctions between time-biased and space-biased media in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to civilization. Media that emphasize time are those durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone. The heavy materials are suited to the development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper. The latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. The conquest of Egypt by Rome gave access to supplies of papyrus, which became the basis of a large administrative empire. Materials that emphasize time favour decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that emphasize space favour centralization and systems of government less hierarchical in character.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1950) ''Empire and Communications''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|right|thumb|The encounter of European traders from a space-bound print culture with aboriginal hunters from a time-bound oral culture. Innovation meets tradition with disastrous, long-term results.]]

Societies that depend solely on time-biased media are oral and tribal. Although leadership tends to be hierarchical, time-bound societies may also operate by consensus. Since, in their purest form, time-bound cultures do not rely on written records, they must preserve their traditions in story, song and myth handed down unchanged from one generation to the next. For them memory is of crucial importance; they revere the wisdom of elders and favour concrete over abstract forms of thought. On the other hand, societies that depend on space-biased media such as printed newspapers and books tend to favour abstract thought and control over space. They have little regard for tradition and when compared with oral societies, their ways of thinking are apt to be  more rational, linear and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;See Babe, pp.72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encounter of European traders from the imperial centres of France and Britain with the aboriginal tribes of North America that Innis chronicled in ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' is a poignant example of what can happen when two different civilizations meet --- one traditional and oriented to preserving its tribal culture in time and the other bent on spreading its influence over long distances. European guns used in war and conquest, for example, enabled the indigenous peoples to hunt more efficiently, but led to the rapid destruction of their food supply and of the beaver they depended on to obtain European goods. Conflicts over hunting territories led to warfare, made more deadly by European bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.150–153. "The apocalypse of culture disorientation that Innis would come to believe followed the introduction of writing and printing, and still later followed the application of power to print reproduction, has its prototype in the collapse of the traditional Indian civilization after the introduction of iron trade goods."&lt;/ref&gt; And all this, Innis argued, disturbed the balance that "...had grown up previous to the coming of the European."&lt;ref&gt; Innis (Fur Trade) pp.388–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance, bias and empire===

Harold Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain the empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. Innis wrote that the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire: "The sword and pen worked together. Power was increased by concentration in a few hands, specialization of function was enforced, and scribes with leisure to keep and study records contributed to the advancement of knowledge and thought. The written record, signed, sealed and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire and Communications) pp.10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis warned however, that such generalizations tended to obscure the differences between empires. So, he embarked on specific studies of the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]; as well as of the effects of the oral tradition on [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] and the written tradition on the [[Roman Empire]]. His reflections appear in separate chapters in his book ''Empire and Communications'' along with additional chapters on the combined effects of parchment and paper in the [[Middle Ages]], and paper and the printing press in the development of modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.52: Heyer writes that ''Empire and Communications'' received few reviews and they ranged from "lukewarm to negative". Yet, many now see it as a Canadian classic because it "has sufficient detail in its analysis and originality to be regarded as a landmark book."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|left|A papyrus copy of Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']]. Using the flexible Greek alphabet, Plato preserved the power of spoken dialogue in written prose. Innis thought this balancing of time and space-oriented media contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece.]]

Biographer John Watson warns against the tendency to apply Innis's concept of media 'bias' in a mechanical or deterministic way. He writes that Innis "emphasizes, in dealing with ''concrete historical cases'', the necessity of a balance of ''various media'' whose predispositions [or biases] complement each other to make for a successful imperial project." Watson points out that for Innis, balance was crucial in sustaining an empire. Innis examined each empire to discover how time-binding and space-binding media contributed to the necessary balance between power and knowledge and among ruling groups – religious, political and military.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.312–319.&lt;/ref&gt; As Innis himself wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concentration on a medium of communication implies a bias in the cultural development of the civilization concerned either towards an emphasis on space and political organization or towards an emphasis on time and religious organization. Introduction of a second medium tends to check the bias of the first and to create conditions suited to the growth of empire. The [[Byzantine empire]] emerged from a fusion of a bias incidental to [[papyrus]] in relation to political organization and of [[parchment]] in relation to ecclesiastical organization.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (''Empire and Communications''). p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]]. Plato conveyed his ideas by recording the conversations of [[Socrates]]. His philosophy thus preserved "the power of the spoken word on the written page." Plato's method of using poetic dialogues cast in prose enabled him to arrive at new philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.99–100. See also, Heyer, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopolies of knowledge===

In his 1947 presidential address to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Innis remarked: "I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications." He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the [[cuneiform]] script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] to the advent of radio in the 20th century. "In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a monopoly or oligopoly of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued, for example, that a "complex system of writing" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a "special class" of scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains:
[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|right|The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Innis wrote that the monarchs who built the pyramids had to relinquish their absolute power when papyrus replaced stone as the dominant medium of communication.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ''[[Empire and Communications]]'', Innis wrote that the ebb and flow of Egypt's ancient empire partly reflected weaknesses or limitations imposed by "the inflexibility of religious institutions supported by a monopoly over a complex system of writing":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Writing was a difficult and specialized art requiring long apprenticeship, and reading implied a long period of instruction. The god of writing was closely related to the leading deities and reflected the power of the scribe over religion. The scribe had the full qualifications of a special profession and was included in the upper classes of kings, priests, nobles and generals, in contrast with peasants, fishermen, artisans and labourers. Complexity favoured increasing control under a monopoly of priests and the confinement of knowledge to special classes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that this priestly or scribal monopoly disturbed the necessary balance between the religious bias toward time and continuity, and the political bias toward space and power. "A successful empire," he wrote, "required adequate appreciation of the problems of space, which were in part military and political, and of problems of time, which were in part dynastic and biological and in part religious." He ended his essay on ancient Egypt by pointing to the imbalance that arose because the priestly monopoly over writing and knowledge supported an emphasis on time and religion, but neglected the political problems inherent in ruling over an empire extended in space.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harold Innis, monopolies of knowledge eventually face challenges to their power, especially with the arrival of new media. He pointed for example, to the monasteries that spread throughout Europe after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. Their monopoly of knowledge depended on their control over the production of the time-binding medium of parchment useful for preserving hand-copied manuscripts written in Latin. Power was vested therefore, in a scribal and literate, religious elite. The largely illiterate laity depended on priests to interpret the scriptures and on image-driven media such as paintings and statues that depicted the central figures in Biblical stories.

[[Image:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|280px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343 – 1400). Innis pointed out that Chaucer wrote in vernacular English instead of Latin or Norman French hastening the growth of English nationalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Portrait of Chaucer by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;/sub&gt;]]

But the space-binding medium of paper imported from China, Innis wrote, facilitated challenges from Islam and later from a rising commercial class. "Paper supported the growth of trade and cities and of education beyond the control of the monasteries, and in turn of the Church and the cathedrals."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) pp.165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper also supported the rise of vernacular languages reducing Latin's cultural sway.

Innis wrote that the Catholic Church fought to preserve its time-oriented monopoly of knowledge with the [[Inquisition]], but eventually paper achieved even greater power with the invention of the [[printing press]] around the middle of the 15th century. Now, the balance shifted decisively in favour of space over time. The [[Protestant Reformation]] followed, along with European exploration and empire, the rise of science and the evolution of the nation-state. Characteristically, Innis summarizes the far-reaching implications of the new medium of paper in a single paragraph that starts with the Middle Ages and ends with the modern United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dominance of parchment in the West gave a bias toward ecclesiastical organization, which led to the introduction of paper, with its bias toward political organization. With printing, paper facilitated an effective development of the vernaculars and gave expression to their vitality in the growth of nationalism. The adaptability of the alphabet to large-scale machine industry became the basis of literacy, advertising and trade. The book as a specialized product of printing and, in turn, the newspaper strengthened the position of language as a basis of nationalism. In the United States, the dominance of the newspaper led to large-scale development of monopolies of communication in terms of space and implied a neglect of problems of time.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (Empire) p.216. Innis traces the histories of parchment, paper and printing in his book's final chapters, pp. 140–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western civilization in peril===

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him, in the end, to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of "mechanized" communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. Industrial societies cut time into precise fragments suitable to engineers and accountants&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias), p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western civilization suffered from an "obsession with present-mindedness" that eliminated concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Communications media that transmit information quickly over long distances had upset the balance required for cultural survival. "The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine," Innis wrote, "has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. The emphasis on change is the only permanent characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valiant Shield - B2 Stealth bomber from Missouri leads ariel formation.jpg|thumb|A B-2 Stealth Bomber leads an aerial flight formation during exercise [[Valiant Shield]] in 2006. Innis believed that advanced U.S. military technologies reinforced the American obsession with space, empire and force at the expense of time, tradition and knowledge.]]

The crisis facing the West was worsened, Innis argued, because communications monopolies that ran the media were largely immune from outside challenge. They literally spoke the language of the masses, effectively penetrating popular consciousness and shaping public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.385.&lt;/ref&gt; American media, with their dependence on advertising and therefore mass appeal, were extremely effective at mobilizing large audiences. Not only were Americans exhorted to buy the newest "improved" products, they were also exposed to a barrage of propaganda from political elites. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] mastered the newspaper as a communications device, just as his fifth cousin, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] mastered radio.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The news media were also influenced by a large [[public relations]] industry that shaped public opinion on behalf of powerful interests.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Changing Concepts), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis believed that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States by the development of powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the [[Cold War]] led to such an emphasis on military preparedness that the U.S. was placed on a permanent war footing, its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, "Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984). ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer John Watson writes that "the United States represents to Innis something akin to cultural apocalypse."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay entitled, "Technology and Public Opinion in U.S.A," Innis concluded that the United States depended on a foreign policy shaped by military power. "Dependence on organized power and a traditional antipathy to coloured peoples weakens political sensitivity, and lack of experience with problems of continuity and empire threatens the Western world with uncertainty and war."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was among the first to suggest that the U.S. had lost the balance between power and knowledge essential to its long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.381 and 387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) ''A Plea for Time'', pp.61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', Sept. 7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Innis's theories==

Influenced by Innis's communications theories, historian [[Marshall Poe]] proposed a theory on the genesis of new media. He proposed that new media are "pulled" into existence by organized interests after inventors have already developed the technology, or prototypes of the technology, necessary to support the media.  Poe's theory also predicts the effects the media will have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability.&lt;ref name="Poe, A History of Communications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poe|first=Marshall|title=A History of Communication: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-17944-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]], Canadian philosopher, [[public intellectual]] and former colleague of Innis at the [[University of Toronto]], also acknowledged Innis's impact on McLuhan's own works, including "The Gutenberg Galaxy", and "Understanding Media".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15695">The '''hedonic music consumption model''' was created by music researchers Kathleen Lacher and Richard Mizeski in 1994. Their goal was to use this model to examine the responses that listening to rock music creates, and to find if these responses influenced the listener's intention to later purchase the music.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K.

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article begins with a discussion of why the issue of music consumption is important. Music is then explored as an aesthetic product, prior to a discussion of what hedonic consumption is, as well as its origins, and concludes with an in-depth look at the model itself.

==Music consumption==
[[Music]] is consumed in a variety of ways, through the [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]], as well as through [[concerts]] and [[performances]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"&gt;Ouellet, J. F. (2007). The purchase versus illegal download of music by consumers: The influence of consumer response towards the artist and music. Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, 24, 107-119.&lt;/ref&gt;
North and Hargreaves&lt;ref&gt;North, A. C., &amp; Hargreaves, D. J. (Eds.). (1997). Music and consumer behaviour. The social psychology of music (pp. 268-289). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested "record buying is perhaps the ultimate behavioural measure of musical preference, involving the purchaser's [[time]], effort, and [[money]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;282). The study of music purchase and consumption was quite limited as of the early 1990s, as only a few academic studies had investigated this topic at that point in time.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; 
 
The impact of illegal [[music downloads]] and [[file sharing]] has again brought the issue of music purchases to the forefront. Much popular press and current academic work is being devoted to this topic. The latest report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([[IFPI]]) mentions four academic studies in particular (e.g., Zenter, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Zentner, A. (2003). Measuring the effect of online piracy on music sales. Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebowitz, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, S. J. (2006). File sharing: Creative destruction or just plain destruction? Journal of Law and Economics, 49, 1-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, 2006; Rob &amp; Waldfogel, 2006;)&lt;ref&gt;Rob, R., &amp; Waldfogel, J. (2007). Piracy on the silver screen. Journal of Industrial Economics, 55, 379-395.&lt;/ref&gt; that have examined file-sharing as having a negative impact on the record industry. Not all academics believe to be true however, as the Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf (2004) study brought a different viewpoint to this topic in an article published in the prestigious [[Journal of Political Economy]]. These [[Harvard Business School]] professors received considerable media attention with the study's conclusion "the empirical evidence on sales displacement is mixed…the papers using actual file-sharing data, suggest that piracy and music sales are largely unrelated" (pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25).&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer-Gee, F., &amp; Strumpf, K. (2004). The effect of file sharing on record sales: An empirical analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 115, 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and hedonic consumption==
Hedonic consumption was first introduced as an alternative to the traditional consumer behavior model by in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"&gt;Hirschman, E. C., &amp; Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Hedonic consumption: Emerging concepts, methods and propositions. Journal of Marketing, 46, 92-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[consumer research]] has traditionally used the black box approach and has historically analyzed the consumption activities of product categories such as package goods and major consumer [[durables]].&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"&gt;Pucely, M. J., Mizerski, R., &amp; Perrewe, P. (1988). A comparison of measures for the purchase and consumption of pre-recorded music. Advances in Consumer Research, 15, 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Hedonic consumption focuses on products such as the [[arts]], music, and cultural events such as [[rock concerts]], [[fashion shows]] and [[films]]. These "experience" types of products tend to involve individual preferences that can generate certain [[emotions]], feelings and [[behaviors]].

Music is an [[aesthetic]] product as it often provides an emotional or spiritually moving experience specific to an [[individual]].&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"&gt;Charters, S. (2006). Aesthetic products and aesthetic consumption: A review. Consumption, Markets and Culture, 9, 235-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrook&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"&gt;Holbrook, M. B. (1982). Mapping the retail market for esthetic products: The case of jazz records. Journal of Retailing, 58, 114-129.&lt;/ref&gt; also states that music is appreciated primarily for its internal essence as opposed to being viewed strictly as an objective product. However, consumer research literature focusing on these types of products often uses the terms "aesthetic" and "hedonic" almost interchangeably. Charters (2006) points out "hedonic consumption is essentially about [[pleasure]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;240),&lt;ref name="Charters, S. 2006"/&gt; and that pleasure is but one aspect of the overall aesthetic experience. He also notes that "[[popular culture]] works may have ‘layers of meaning' for [[consumer]]s" as they may convey symbolic meaning for people in significance or emotion of some type. From a [[retailing]] standpoint, aesthetic products are characterized as having a wide range of [[Product (business)|product]] offerings in the [[marketplace]].&lt;ref name="Holbrook, M. B. 1982"/&gt;

As Hirschman and Holbrook point out, hedonic consumption expands upon the traditional definition of consumer behavior through its inclusion of "the multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one's experience with products…including tastes, sounds, scents, tactile impressions and visual images" (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; These types of experience-oriented products often involve "[[fun]], amusement, fantasy, [[arousal]], sensory stimulation, and enjoyment" (p.&amp;nbsp;37).&lt;ref name="Pucely, M. J. 1988"/&gt; In addition, hedonic consumption often uses [[ethnic]] background, [[social class]] and [[gender]] to help determine the different consumer emotions and fantasies around a product.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;

==The origins of hedonic consumption==
The study of the hedonic consumption as an academic field began in the late 1970s. It originated out of different [[behavioral science]] fields, including [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psycholinguistics]], and [[psychology]]. Hirschman and Holbrook considered key contributions to come from two fields of prior academic research. The first was the motivation research of the 1950s, "which focused on the emotional aspects of products and fantasies that the products could arouse and/or fulfill" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; [[Ernest Dichter]] was a key figure in this field of research which was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s. One of the major shortcomings of the early motivation research was the fact that many of its [[clinical studies]] lacked rigor and validity.

Hedonic consumption also owes a big debt to the academic field of product symbolism research.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt; One of the important contributors to this academic field includes Sidney J. Levy, who is now the Coca-Cola Distinguished Professor of Marketing at Eller College of Management at the [[University of Arizona]]. He wrote the groundbreaking article "Symbols for Sale" which first appeared in the July–August 1959 edition of the ''Harvard Business Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbols For Sale. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 203-212). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. (Original work published 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Levy observed "consumers buy products and brands not only for so-called functional reasons but for the various ‘symbolic meanings' that their consumption provides" (p.&amp;nbsp;198).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"&gt;Rook, D. W. (Ed.). (1999). The symbolic nature of marketing. Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 197-201). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early Levy article "Symbolism and Life Style" was originally published in the December 1963 American Marketing Association's ''Toward Scientific Marketing'' Winter Conference Proceedings. In this article, Levy expanded upon his earlier writings by urging marketers to consider "the sum of an individual's consumption of symbolic goods and services as a 'lifestyle'" (p.&amp;nbsp;199).&lt;ref name="Rook, D. W. 1999 pp. 197-201"/&gt; Levy was interested in the development of a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that would allow marketers to be able to think more systematically about how to meaningfully fulfill the needs of their individual consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. J. (1999). Symbolism and Life Style. In D. W. Rook (Ed.), Brands, consumers, symbols, and research: Sidney J. Levy on marketing (pp. 217-224). Thousand Oaks,CA: Sage. (Original work published 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
Hirschman and Holbrook's research in the hedonic consumption field first led Kathleen Lacher to begin to explore music as a hedonic consumption product in the late 1980s. Her goal was to try to understand the factors behind why people bought music.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she joined forces with Richard Mizerski to conduct an experiment that explored music purchase intentions. These professors proposed a theoretical model they named the "model of music consumption and purchase intention". Their basic premise was that people buy music because of the "experience that the music creates by itself or because music can enhance other experiences, whether it is an individual or shared experiences with others" (p.&amp;nbsp;367).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

==Model building blocks==
Lacher and Mizerski based their experiments on previous music research that was conducted in the fields of [[music education]] and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Lacher, K. T. (1989). Hedonic consumption: Music as a product. Advances in Consumer Research, 16, 367-373&lt;/ref&gt; They tested music on four "responses" to see what, if any, had any effect on music purchase intentions.

#''Emotion'' - or the feelings people experience when hearing music, which usually range across a scale extending from rage to [[love]]. Emotion is also considered to be one of the primary factors in [[music appreciation]] as well as a potential factor in the [[purchasing process]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
#''Sensory'' – music often invokes a raw physical response to move physically or sway to the music. Yingling describes this primal process as "an awareness to the listener's need to either move physically towards or away" from the music source.&lt;ref&gt;Yingling, R. W. (1962). Classification of reaction patterns in listening to music. Journal of Research in Music Education, 10, 105-120.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#''Imaginal'' – This response often involves "images, ''memories'' or situations that music evokes" (p.&amp;nbsp;109).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; The imaginal response also tends to invoke memories of past events, or to imagine events that could take place in the future.&lt;ref name="Hirschman, E. C. 1982"/&gt;
#''Analytical'' – This response often involves pre-conceived expectations about the music itself. Listeners tend to separate music by identifying of the technical aspects of the music (e.g., [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], etc.); type, through music genre (e.g., rock, [[Folk music|folk]], etc.); and intrinsic, through other personalized listener factors (e.g., contemporary, religious, etc.).&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt; 
	
Next, these first four inputs link together along a pathway towards music purchase using four additional factors:

&lt;li&gt;''Experiential response'' – or the experience that one has in becoming absorbed or involved in the music.&lt;ref name="Ouellet, J. F. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ''overall affective behavior'' – This is more than just emotion, which "tends to be characterized by short duration intense reactionary episodes attributed to a specific cause.&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2003). Theory of affective dynamics: Emotions and moods. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 533-567). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacher and Mizerski considered the affective domain to capture the various interactions between basic emotions, emotional patterns, as well as [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] and motivations, as well as the previously identified analytical and imagery responses as well.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Reexperience the music'' – This revolves around the listener's need to want to listen to the music again. The researchers considered this to be a ''key factor'' of music purchase. In other words, the listener is motivated enough to purchase the product in order to control the type of music played, as well as where, when, and with whom the music is experienced in the [[future]].&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Purchase intention'' is the ultimate outcome of the hedonic music consumption model purchase. It should be noted that Lacher and Mizerski hypothesized that each of the first four inputs could also lead directly to any of the factors in the second cluster as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==The revised significant-paths-only hedonic music consumption model==
Lacher and Mizerski conducted [[experiment]]s with college students to determine if the directly linked relationships they had proposed between these eight factors stayed consistent in ultimately predicting rock music purchases. They picked this music genre as previous research suggested most recorded music was bought by people between the ages of 10 and 25, and that this was the preferred genre of the students in test groups.&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

Lacher and Mizerski found during the course of the tests that their [[hypotheses]] were not as consistent as they had thought, and in some cases, the relationships were not direct. Still they were able to make some general conclusions about why people buy music. They revised their original model to create a significant-paths-only model hedonic music consumption model detailing the revised relationships between the factors. The emotional response was broken down to include six different music dimensions that ranged from calm to exuberant. In short, their end goal was to "foster a systematic system of why people purchase music so we can better understand this important marketplace behavior" (p.&amp;nbsp;375).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt; One of the ways that Lacher and Mizerski believed that this hedonic music consumption model might prove helpful in terms of future research was to explain the consumption of other "hedonic" products such as [[books]], movies, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[paintings]] and [[sports]] events" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).&lt;ref name="Lacher, K. T. 1994"/&gt;

[[File:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|[[Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]] with ear trumpet]]
The first [[hearing aid]] was created in the 17th century. The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the [[telephone]], and the first electric hearing aid was created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing aid was distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.

The invention of the [[carbon microphone]], [[transmitters]], digital signal processing chip or [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], and the development of [[computer]] technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Howard, Alexander. "Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter." New York Times, November 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ear trumpets==
{{Main|Ear trumpet}}
[[File:King goa's chair.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Rein's ingenious acoustic chair, designed for King [[John VI of Portugal]] in the early 19th-century.]]
The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf, dates back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the [[deaf education|deaf educator]] John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]) and the Daubeney Trumpet.

The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. As well as producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold  hearing fans, and [[speaking tube]]s. These instruments helped amplify sounds, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held [[ear trumpet]]s and cones were used as hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Levitt, H. "Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts." ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Mills, Mara. "Hearing Aids and the History of Electronics Miniaturization." IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 33.2 (2011): 24-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rein hearing aid catalog.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th century designs.]] 
Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King of [[Portugal]], [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/did/19thcent/part2.htm|title=Concealed Hearing Devices of the 19th Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' ''Aurolese Phones'' were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would amplify the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Electronic hearing aids==
[[File:Vacuum tube hearing aid use 1933.jpg|thumb|A 1933 ad for early vacuum tube hearing aids.]]
[[File:Museum of Medicine Berlin Germany Telephone hearing aids.jpg|thumb|These German hearing aids date from around 1920 to 1950. They include an attachment similar to a telephone receiver. Museum of Medicine, Berlin, Germany.]]
The first electronic hearing aids were constructed after the invention of the [[telephone]] and [[microphone]] in the 1870s and 1880s. The technology within the telephone increased how acoustic signal could be altered. Telephones were able to control the [[loudness]], [[frequency]], and distortion of sounds. These abilities were used in the creation of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The first electric hearing aid, called the Akouphone, was created by [[Miller Reese Hutchison]] in 1898. It used a carbon transmitter, so that the hearing aid could be portable. The [[carbon transmitter]] was used to amplify sound by taking a weak signal and using [[electric current]] to make it a strong signal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; These electronic hearing aids could eventually be shrunk into purses and other accessories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  

One of the first manufacturers of the electronically amplified hearing aid was the [[Siemens]] company in 1913. Their hearing aids were bulky and not easily portable. They were about the size of a "tall cigar box" and had a speaker that would fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The first [[vacuum-tube]] hearing aid was patented by a Naval [[engineer]] Earl Hanson in 1920. It was called the Vactuphone and used the telephone [[transmitter]] to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Marconi]] in England and [[Western Electric]] in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the vacuum tube hearing aid became more successful and began to decrease in size with better miniaturization techniques. The Acousticon's Model 56 was created in the mid-1920s and was one of the first portable hearing aid units, although it was quite heavy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The first wearable hearing aid using vacuum tube technology went on sale in England in 1936, and a year later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKbApRUm4kkC|title=Audiologists' Desk Reference: Audiologic management, rehabilitation, and terminology|author=James Wilbur Hall|year=1998|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, hearing aids were becoming popular to the public.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Multitone Electronics|Multitone of London]] patented the first hearing aid to use [[automatic gain control]]. The same company introduced a wearable version in 1948.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Military technological advances that occurred in [[World War II]] helped the development of hearing aids. One of the major advances that World War II enabled was the idea of miniaturization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  This could be seen by Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Transistor hearing aids== 
[[File:Hearing aid 1980s close up.jpg|thumb|200x200px|This early 1980s photo shows a hearing aid with a transistor that is worn over the chest with shoulder straps. It would sometimes have a problem with static interference, even if the wearer laughed or smiled.]]
The development of [[transistors]] in 1948 by [[Bell Laboratories]] led to major improvements to the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The transistor was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]].  Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less [[distortion]] and heat than their predecessor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;K., W. (1953, Apr 19). Transistors in need of improvement. New York Times (1923-Current File), pp. E9.&lt;/ref&gt;The 1952 [[Sonotone 1010]] used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life.   The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, carbon microphones. These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  In 1951, [[Raytheon]] manufactured the transistor and was one of the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The act of putting transistors into hearing aids was so quick that they were not properly tested. It was later found that transistors could get damp. Because of this dampness, the hearing aid would only last for a few weeks and then die. In order to stop this from happening, a coating had to be put on the transistor to protect it from the dampness. This problem had to be fixed in order for transistors in hearing aids to be successful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   

Zenith was the first company to realize the problem with transistors was the body heat of individuals. After coming to this conclusion, the first “all-transistor” hearing aids were offered in 1952, called the Microtone Transimatic and the Maico Transist-ear. In 1954, the company, [[Texas Instruments]], produced a [[silicon]] transistor, which was much more effective than the previous version.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The end of the transistor was marked by the creation of the [[integrated circuit]] or IC by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the technique was perfected in hearing aids over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Elmer V. Carlson, the author of thirty patents, was instrumental in inventing many of the components of the modern hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt; http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-25/news/0301250251_1_hearing-aids-mr-carlson-elmer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymotic.com/media/publications/erl-0114-1992.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital hearing aid== 
Beginning in the early 1960s, Bell Telephone Laboratories created a process for creating both speech and audio signals on a large [[mainframe computer]]. Because of the size of digital computers, the process of simulating hearing aids was extremely slow. The progression of the audio speech signal took longer than the length of the duration of the signal itself. In order to get the power needed to process the sound, a large mainframe computer was needed. This made it nearly impossible to conceive the idea that hearing aids could be made into something that could be made to fit onto an ear. This research was important for learning about how to develop sounds for those with hearing disabilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;     

In addition, in the 1970s, the [[microprocessor]] was created. This microprocessor helped to open up the door to miniaturization of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Moreover, researcher [[Edgar Villchur]] developed multi-channel [[amplitude compression]]. Amplitude compression enabled [[audio signal]] to be separated into [[frequency band]]s. These bands were able to adjust sounds so that sounds that were more intensive were weakened and sounds that were weakened would become more intensified. The system of multi-channel amplitude compression would be later used as the fundamental structural design for the first hearing aids that used [[digital technology]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
  
[[File:Traditional hearing aids.jpg|thumb|Some hearing aids from the early 21st century with traditional designs.]]
Another pioneer in hearing aid development was Daniel Graupe, who developed the six-channel hearing aid. The six-channel hearing aid in 1975 had digital control of the frequency in all channels. In 1979, electro-acoustic features of hearing aids were able to be changed by a simple button. The pressing of this button caused the amplification to be altered to appropriate levels for the environment in which the individual was present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This technique of controlling the hearing aid for the environment is used in some manner throughout all digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The creation of high-speed digital-array [[processors]] used in [[minicomputers]] opened up the door for advances in digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  These minicomputers were able to process audio signals at speeds that were equivalent to real-time. In 1982, at the [[City University of New York]], the first real-time all digital hearing aid was created. The equipment contained a digital array processor and minicomputer. This consisted of an FM [[radio transmitter]] and receiver. The radio made a connection between the individual through a transmitter on the body to the radio on top of the computer. The transmitter on the body was connected by a wire to the ear microphone and the receiver.  Even though this was a major breakthrough in the creation of hearing aids, there were still a few problems. One of these major problems was that while the hearing aid worked, it was extremely heavy and nearly impossible to move.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
[[File:Oticon Bluetooth hearing aids.jpg|thumb|left|Oticon hearing aids to be used with [[Bluetooth]] wireless devices.]]

The first commercial digital hearing aid was created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation. The hearing aid contained a body-worn processor that had a hardwire connection with an ear mounted transducer. While the Nicolet Corporation’s hearing aid was not publicly successful and the company shortly folded, it was able to start a competition between companies to create more effective hearing aids. Two years later, in 1989, the behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aid was launched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In addition to the Nicolet Corporation, Bell Laboratories expanded upon the hearing aid business by developing a hybrid digital-analog hearing aid. This hearing aid used digital circuits to handle a two-channel compression amplifier. Even though early research on this hearing aid was successful, [[AT&amp;T]], the parent company to Bell Laboratories, pulled out of the hearing aid market and sold its rights to Resound Corporation in 1987. When the hearing aid was put on in the market, it was instantaneously successful. This development helped bring major changes to the world of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

After the success of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid companies began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included analog amplifiers, filters, and limiters that were managed digitally. There were many benefits to these hearing aids; which included storing parameter settings, having a capability for paired-comparison testing, having settings for different acoustic environments, and having more advanced methods of signaling; this which included multi-channel compression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The next major milestone was creating an all-digital hearing aid. The Oticon Company developed the first digital hearing aid in 1995, but it was only distributed to audiological research centers for research on digital technology in the realm of acoustic amplification. The Senso was the first commercially successful, all-digital hearing aid, and was created by Widex in 1996.  After the success of the Senso, Oticon began marketing their own hearing aid, the DigiFocus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Current digital hearing aids are now programmable which enables digital hearing aids to regulate the sound on their own, without using a separate control. The hearing aid can now adjust itself depending on what environment it is in and often does not even need a physical volume control button.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Kenneth. "Hearing Aid Museum ." Kent State University Excellence in Action. http://www.kent.edu/ehhs/spa/museum/history.cfm (accessed May 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,  "Made for iPhone hearing aids" (MFi) were introduced by Resound, which enables users of MFi digital hearing aids to stream phone calls, music, and podcasts directly from iOS devices. &lt;ref&gt;Apple, Inc. "Made for iPhone Hearing Aids" https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/hearing-aids/ (accessed January 28, 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly leveraging the audio processing power potential in smartphones, Jacoti BVBA from Belgium developed ListenApp, the first digital hearing aid application to win CE certification and FDA approval as a medical device. &lt;ref&gt;Jacoti, BVBA, "Jacoti ListenApp" https://www.jacoti.com/listenapp/ (accessed January 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing aid chips==
One of the first digital chips was created by Daniel Graupe.  The digital chip, referred to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise.  The chip was integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital chips that were devoted to high-speed [[digital signal processing]] or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, chips were produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these chips was the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these chips was that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Image:interstitial space.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Figure 1. Hypothetical interstitial space design for a medical facility.]]An '''interstitial space''' is an intermediate space located between regular-use floors, commonly located in hospitals and laboratory-type buildings to allow space for the mechanical systems of the building.  By providing this space, laboratory and hospital rooms may be easily rearranged throughout their lifecycles and therefore reduce lifecycle cost.

==Description==

An interstitial space is useful when the mechanical system of the building is highly sophisticated and changing the space on the primary floors is a distinct possibility.  The heights of these spaces are generally six to eight feet and allow easy access for repair or alteration.&lt;ref&gt;Hospital and Healthcare Facility Design: 2nd Edition. Richard L. Miller and Earl S. Swensson. W W Norton &amp; Co Inc., 2002, pp. 51&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;  If changes or maintenance need to be performed in the interstitial space, the primary space does not need to be shut down, which is important in buildings like hospitals where the equipment in the space must operate constantly.  Unlike traditionally built buildings, where the mechanical space is located in the basement or on the top floor, the interstitial space needs few vertical penetrations and therefore leaves more open space on the primary floor.  The entire floor plan of these buildings can be more open because there are fewer fixed vertical penetrations through the floor and walls.

Another way to use an interstitial space is to incorporate a design that divides the functions of the building into groups and localizes them.  The Zeidler Partnership Architects’ (ZPA) design of the [[William Osler Health Centre]] (WOHC) in [[Brampton, Ontario]], is one example of this design.  (Note: this was designed but ZPA was not awarded the project.)  The groups in this design are based on similar structural and mechanical systems.  Flexible design allows for easy expansion or redesign in the future.  Horizontal expansion is especially easy because of the interstitial space between the surgical suite and the emergency floors, where the mechanical system functions are the most crucial in this building.  Double floor height is used to maintain the horizontal flow of connections throughout the rest of the building without causing any interference with other building systems.

==History==

The idea of using an interstitial space was started in the 1960s by professors at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]’s College of Architecture.  Their concept was to standardize spaces and allow for rapid changes in medical facilities.  While the spaces for building systems like plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems were not as large as today’s, it was an important beginning of an idea to separate the systems by floor.  The first building to actually use an interstitial space design was [[Louis Kahn]]’s Salk Institute of Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]].  The design allowed the building to keep up with ever-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Fine and Stephen Vanderber. Healthcare In An Era Of Radical Transformation. Yale University Press, 2000, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;  From there, designs progressed to concepts created by ZPA; a firm who has completed over 40 healthcare and lab facilities for buildings using an interstitial space design.&lt;ref&gt;Planning for Change: Hospital Design Theories in Practice (http://www.aia.org/nwsltr_print.cfm?pagename=aah_jrnl_20051019_change). Retrieved on 2008-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many firms have drawn inspiration from ZPA and use their concept to develop their own design.  Some designs cover the whole floor area and some, like the WOHC, are partial interstitial spaces.

==Pros and cons of using an interstitial space==

===Pros===

Interstitial spaces are exceedingly useful when a building needs to be re-modeled.  In a medical or lab facility, technology improves incredibly fast and no one can predict what equipment buildings will need to be designed for in the future.  With an interstitial space, room layouts in the primary floor may be altered much more easily than traditionally designed buildings since there are fewer service stacks penetrating the floors.  The walls can be arranged and rearranged freely.  If a drastic renovation must occur, only one floor at a time has to be shut down for renovation, instead of the whole building.  The cost of the building is reduced significantly since major equipment does not have to be changed during a renovation.   Lifecycle cost includes anything that pertains to the building from when it is in its schematic design phase until it is demolished.  A chart of the cost distribution is shown in figure 2.  If the equipment itself must be [[retrofitted]], it can be done faster, since the spaces have ample area to work and are separated by floor.  The lifetime of the building may also be increased, since the adaptable spaces may be retrofitted instead of needing to be torn down for a redesigned building.

[[Image:Lifecycle building cost pie chart.jpg|frame|center|600px|Figure 2. Lifecycle building cost pie chart.]]

Separating the building systems from the primary space can also be helpful during construction.  If sequenced correctly, it can decrease the installation time of major equipment significantly.  Each trade may work on one floor and move to the next after another is finished.  Also, wall, ceiling, and floor finishes may be worked on while the building systems are installed as opposed to a traditionally designed building where they would have to wait for more equipment to be installed.

Another advantage of using an interstitial space is that easy access to the equipment in them may encourage preventative maintenance.  If a more efficient system can be installed easily, it can again reduce lifecycle cost.

===Cons===

The largest and most well known negative of interstitial spaces is a high first cost.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Riley and Sandra Vondrak. Interstitial Space Design In Modern Laboratories. Journal of Architectural Engineering, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 60-70&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding more floors increases the amount of material used for floor decks, walls, etc.  The construction expense becomes much larger when anything is added because it affects many other systems in the building.  One main thing that increases is the amount of façade material necessary to cover the skin of the building.  Depending on that material, the cost and time of construction could be largely inflated.

Equipment costs can become a large deterrent of owners also.  Several smaller pieces of equipment must be purchased for each floor instead of one large piece for the whole building.  The large piece of equipment is much cheaper than all of the small pieces combined in almost every case.

The '''Jack Welch Management Institute''' at [[Strayer University]] is a [[For-profit college|for-profit]] [[Distance education|online]] educational institution founded in 2009 and based in the United States, offering an executive [[Master of Business Administration]] degree and executive certificates for working adults. It was founded by [[Jack Welch]], former CEO of [[General Electric]]. The company is headquartered outside of [[Washington D.C.]] at Strayer University's corporate office - 2303 Dulles Station Blvd, Herndon, VA 20171.

==History==
The Jack Welch Management Institute was developed in 2009 by former [[General Electric|GE]] CEO Jack Welch in partnership with [[Chancellor University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Jack Welch MBA Coming to Web |author=Paul Glader

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">The '''MPLAB''' series of devices are [[Programmer (hardware)|programmer]]s and [[In-circuit emulator|debugger]]s for [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]] [[PIC microcontroller|PIC and dsPIC]] [[microcontroller]]s, developed by [[Microchip Technology]].

The ICD family of [[In-circuit emulator|debugger]]s has been produced since the release of the first Flash-based PIC microcontrollers, and the latest ICD 3 currently supports all current PIC and dsPIC devices. It is the most popular combination debugging/programming tool from Microchip.

The REAL ICE [[In-circuit emulator|emulator]] is similar to the ICD, with the addition of better debugging features, and various add-on modules that expand its usage scope. The ICE is a family of discontinued in-circuit emulators for PIC and dsPIC devices, and is currently superseded by the REAL ICE.

==MPLAB ICD==
The '''MPLAB ICD''' is the first in-circuit debugger product by Microchip, and is currently discontinued and superseded by ICD 2.&lt;ref name="icd1"&gt;[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/51192c.pdf MPLAB®ICD Kit], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD connected to the engineer's PC via [[RS-232]], and connected to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt;

The ICD supported devices within the PIC16C and PIC16F families, and supported full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt; Only one hardware breakpoint was supported by the ICD.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt;

==MPLAB ICD 2==
[[File:MPLAB ICD2.png|thumb|The MPLAB ICD 2]]
The '''MPLAB ICD 2''' is a discontinued in-circuit debugger and programmer by Microchip, and is currently superseded by ICD 3.&lt;ref name="icd2"&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=dv164005 MPLAB ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD 2 connects to the engineer's PC via USB or [[RS-232]], and connects to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd2b"&gt;[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/51264B.pdf MPLAB®ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger/Programmer], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICD 2 supports most PIC and dsPIC devices within the PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, dsPIC, rfPIC and PIC32 families,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnp.ucsd.edu/phy120b/pic_manuals_pdf/Readme_for_MPLAB_ICD_2.htm Release Notes for MPLAB® ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger], University of California&lt;/ref&gt; and supports full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd2b"/&gt; At breakpoints, data and program memory can be read and modified using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt; The ICD 2 firmware is field upgradeable using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt;

The ICD 2 can be used to erase, program or reprogram PIC MCU program memory, while the device is installed on target hardware, using ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt; Target device voltages from 2.0V to 6.0V are supported.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt;

==MPLAB ICD 3==
[[File:MPLAB ICD3.png|thumb|The MPLAB ICD 3]]
The '''MPLAB ICD 3''' is an in-circuit debugger and programmer by Microchip, and is the latest in the ICD series.&lt;ref name="icd3"&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164035 MPLAB ICD 3 In-Circuit Debugger], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD 3 connects to the engineer's PC via USB, and connects to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; The ICD 3 is entirely USB-bus-powered, and is 15x faster than the ICD 2 for programming devices.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 supports all current PIC and dsPIC devices within the PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, dsPIC, rfPIC and PIC32 families, and supports full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; At breakpoints, data and program memory can be read and modified using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; The ICD 3 firmware is field upgradeable using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 can be used to erase, program or reprogram PIC MCU program memory, while the device is installed on target hardware, using ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; Target device voltages from 2.0V to 5.5V are supported.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 has over-voltage protection in the probe drivers to guard against power surges from the target.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; All lines have over-current protection. The ICD 3 can also provide power to a target, up to 100 [[Ampere|mA]].&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

==MPLAB REAL ICE==
[[File:MPLAB REALICE.png|thumb|The MPLAB REAL ICE]]
The '''MPLAB REAL ICE''' ('''I'''n-'''C'''ircuit '''E'''mulator) is a high-speed emulator for Microchip devices. It debugs and programs PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers in conjunction with the [[MPLAB]] IDE, while the target device is "in-circuit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV244005 MPLAB REAL ICE In-Circuit Emulator], Microchip Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O4XNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA519&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ Microcontrollers: High-Performance Systems and Programming], CRC Press, 28-Oct-2013&lt;/ref&gt; The REAL ICE is significantly faster than the ICD 2, for programming and debugging.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r7ihP8HDd2cC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false Programming the PIC Microcontroller], Tata McGraw-Hill Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b4"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pdbf2HuMzREC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false PIC Microcontrollers: An Introduction to Microelectronics], Elsevier, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The REAL ICE connects to the engineer's [[Personal computer|PC]] via a [[USB]] 2.0 interface, and connects to the target device via [[In-circuit serial programming|ICSP]] (PGC/PGD programming pins), typically using a RJ11 connector. [[Low-voltage differential signaling|LVDS]] is also available for high-speed data transfer between the device and the REAL ICE. MPLAB REAL ICE is field upgradeable through firmware downloads in MPLAB IDE.

The REAL ICE supports 8-bit devices (PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18), 16-bit devices (PIC24, dsPIC) and 32-bit devices (PIC32MX).&lt;ref name="b3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PTcNpClUH1QC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32], Newnes, 08-Apr-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance Pak===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10918">'''Malleability of intelligence''' describes the processes by which [[intelligence]] can increase or decrease over time and is not static.  These changes may come as a result of [[genetics]], [[pharmacological]] factors, [[psychological]] factors, [[behavior]], or [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental conditions]].  Malleable intelligence may refer to changes in [[cognition|cognitive skills]], [[memory]], [[reasoning]], or [[muscle memory]] related [[motor skills]]. 
In general, the majority changes in human intelligence occurs at either the onset of development, during the [[critical period]], or during old age (see [[Neuroplasticity]]).

[[Charles Spearman]], who coined the [[general intelligence factor]] "g", described intelligence as one's ability to adapt to his environment with a set of useful skills including reasoning and understanding patterns and relationships.  He believed individuals highly developed in one intellectual ability tended to be highly developed at other intellectual abilities.  A more intelligent individual was thought to be able to more easily "accommodate" experiences into existing cognitive structures to develop structures more compatible with environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="garlick"&gt;Garlick, D. (2002). Understanding the nature of the general factor of intelligence: The role of individual differences in neural plasticity as an explanatory mechanism. [Review]. Psychological Review, 109(1), 116–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, intelligence is thought to be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors, but the extent to which each plays a key role is highly disputed.  Studies of identical and non-identical twins raised separately and together show a strong correlation between child [[IQ]] and [[socioeconomic status|socio-economic level]] of the parents.  Children raised in lower-class families tend to score lower on intelligence tests when compared to children raised in both middle and upper-class families.  However, there is no difference in intelligence scores between children raised in middle versus upper-class families.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
*'''[[Intelligence]]''': a very general capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience.&lt;ref name="deary"&gt;Deary, I. J., Penke, L., &amp; Johnson, W. (2010). The neuroscience of human intelligence differences. [Review]. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11(3), 201–211.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Critical period]]''': a restricted developmental period during which the nervous system is particularly sensitive to the effects of experience .&lt;ref&gt;Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., LaMantia, A., McNamara, J., et al. (2008). Neuroscience (4th ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuroscience basis ==

The biological basis of [[intelligence]] is founded in the degree of connectivity of [[neurons]] in the brain and the varying amounts of [[white matter|white]] and [[grey matter|grey]] matter.  Studies show that intelligence is positively correlated with total [[cerebrum|cerebral]] volume.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt;  While it is true that the number of neurons in the brain actually decreases throughout development, as neural connections grow and the pathways become more efficient, the supporting structures in the brain increase.  This increase in supporting tissues, which include [[myelination]], [[blood vessels]], and [[glial cells]], leads to an increase in overall brain size.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt;  When brain circumference and [[IQ]] were compared in 9 year olds, a positive correlation was found between the two.  An increase of 2.87 IQ points occurred for each [[standard deviation]] increase in brain [[circumference]].&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Gale, C. R., O'Callaghan, F. J., Godfrey, K. M., Law, C. M., &amp; Martyn, C. N. (2004). Critical periods of brain growth and cognitive function in children. [Article]. Brain, 127, 321–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of critical period ===
The brain grows rapidly for the first five years of human development.  At age five, the human brain is 90% of its total size.  Then the brain finishes growing gradually until age twenty.  From start to finish, the brain increases in size by over 300% from birth.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Linden, D. J. (2007). The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[critical period]], defined as the beginning years of brain development, is essential to intellectual development, as the brain optimizes the overproduction of [[synapses]] present at birth.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; During the [[critical period]], the neuronal pathways are refined based on which synapses are active and receiving transmission.  It is a "use it or lose it" phenomenon.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

=== Neural plasticity ===
[[Neural plasticity]] refers to any change in the structure of the neural network that forms the central nervous system. Neural plasticity is the neuronal basis for changes in how the mind works, including learning, the formation of memory, and changes in intelligence. One well-studied form of plasticity is [[Long-Term Potentiation]] (LTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malenka|first=R.C.|author2=Nicoll, R.A.|title=Long-term potentiation – a decade of progress?|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=285|pages=1870–1874|doi=10.1126/science.285.5435.1870|issue=5435}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a change in neural connectivity as a result of high activation on both sides of a synaptic cleft. This change in neural connectivity allows information to be more easily processed, as the neural connection associated with that information becomes stronger through LTP.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; Other forms of plasticity involve the growth of new neurons, the growth of new connections between neurons, and the selective elimination of such connection, called "dendritic pruning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segal|first=M.|title=Dendritic spines and long-term plasticity|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=6|pages=277–284|doi=10.1038/nrn1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic factors of intelligence ===
Humans have varying degrees of [[neuroplasticity]] due to their genetic makeups, which affects their ability to adapt to conditions in their environments and effectively learn from experiences.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt; The degree to which intelligence test scores can be linked to genetic [[heritability]] ''increases'' with age.  There is presently no explanation for this puzzling result, but flaws in the testing methods are suspected. A study of Dutch twins concludes that intelligence of 5 year olds is 26% [[heritability|heritable]], while the test scores of 12-year-olds is 64% [[heritability|heritable]].  Structurally, genetic influences explain 77–88% of the variance in the thickness of the [[sagittal plane|mid-sagittal area]] of the [[corpus callosum]], the volume of the [[caudate nucleus]], and the volumes of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes.&lt;ref name="deary"/&gt;

== Pharmacological influence ==
Numerous [[pharmacological]] developments have been made to help organize neural circuitry for patients with learning disorders.  The [[cholinergic]] and [[glutamatergic]] systems in the brain serve an important role in learning, memory, and the developmental organization of neuronal circuitry.  These systems help to capitalize on the critical period and organize [[synaptic transmission]].  [[Autism]] and other learning disabilities have been targeted with drugs focusing on cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission.  These drugs increase the amount of [[acetylcholine]] present in the brain by increasing the production of acetylcholine precursors, as well as inhibiting acetylcholine degradation by [[cholinesterases]].  By focusing on heightening the activity of this system, the brain's responsiveness to [[activity-dependent plasticity]] is improved.  Specifically, glutamatergic drugs may reduce the threshold for [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]], promote more normal [[dendritic spine]] morphology, and retain a greater number of useful synaptic connections.  Cholinergic drugs may reconnect the [[basal forebrain]] with the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and [[hippocampus]], connections that are often disrupted in patients with learning disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Capone, G. T. (1998). Drugs that increase intelligence? Application for childhood cognitive impairment. [Proceedings Paper]. Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews, 4(1), 36–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological factors==
[[Psychological]] factors and preconceived notions about intelligence can be as influential on intelligence as genetic makeup.  Children with early [[chronic stress]] show impaired corticolimbic connectivity in development.  Early chronic stress is defined as inconsistent or inadequate care-giving and disruption to early rearing environment.  These children showed decreased [[cognitive function]], especially in fluid [[cognition]], or the ability to effectively utilize [[working memory]].  The lack of connectivity between the [[limbic system]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]] can be blamed for this deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, C. (2006). How similar are fluid cognition and general intelligence? A developmental neuroscience perspective on fluid cognition as an aspect of human cognitive ability. [Review]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29(2), 109–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral factors==
In the study of malleable intelligence, behavioral factors are often the most intriguing because these are factors humans can seek to control.  There are numerous behavioral factors that affect intellectual development and [[neural plasticity]].  The key is plasticity, which is caused by experience-driven electrical activation of [[neurons]].  This experience-driven activation causes [[axons]] to sprout new branches and develop new [[chemical synapse|presynaptic terminals]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  These new branches often lead to greater mental processing in different areas.

===Taking advantage of the critical period===
As previously discussed, the [[critical period]] is a time of neural pruning and great intellectual development.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|300px|This 2009 photo shows music production using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[multi-monitor]] setup.]]

'''Music technology''' is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform [[music]]; to [[musical composition|compose]], [[music notation|notate]], play back or record songs or pieces; or to [[Music informatics|analyze]] or [[Digital audio editor|edit]]  music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes.&lt;ref name="speakstick.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://speakstick.net/blogs/speakstick/evolution-of-music|title=How Music Technology Evolved Over the Years? – SpeakStick|website=speakstick.net|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ians developed stringed instruments, such as [[harp]]s, [[lyre]]s and [[lute]]s, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used [[wind instrument]]s such as [[double clarinet]]s and [[percussion instrument]]s such as [[cymbals]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the [[horn (instrument)|horn]], pipe, lyre, harp, and [[bagpipe]]. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the [[Middle Ages]], [[music notation]] was used to create a written record of the notes of [[plainchant]] melodies.

During the [[Renaissance music]] era, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the Baroque era (1600–1750), technologies for [[keyboard instrument]]s developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the [[piano]]. In the classical era, [[Beethoven]] added new instruments to the [[orchestra]] to create new sounds, such as the [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]]s, and [[Bass drum|untuned percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]. During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810–1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as [[saxophone]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[Wagner tuba]]s, and [[cornet]]s were added to the [[orchestra]].

Around the turn of the 20th century, with the invention and popularization of the [[gramophone record]] (commercialized in 1892), and [[radio broadcasting]] (starting on a commercial basis ca. 1919-1920), there was a vast increase in music listening, and it was easier to distribute music to a wider public.&lt;ref name="speakstick.net"/&gt; The development of [[sound recording]] had a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed.  The invention of [[sound recording]] gave rise to new subgenre of [[classical music]], the [[Musique concrete]] style of electronic composition. The invention of [[multitrack recording]] enabled pop bands to overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. In the early 20th century, electric technologies such as [[electromagnetic pickup]]s, [[power amplifier|amplifiers]] and [[loudspeaker]]s were used to develop new electric instruments such as the [[electric piano]] (1929), [[electric guitar]] (1931), [[Hammond organ|electro-mechanical organ]] (1934) and [[electric bass]] (1935). The 20th-century orchestra gained new instruments and new sounds. Some orchestra pieces used the [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]] or the [[Theremin]].

The invention of the miniature [[transistor]] in 1947 enabled the creation of a new generation of [[synthesizer]]s, which were used first in pop music in the 1960s. Unlike prior [[keyboard instrument]] technologies, synthesizer keyboards do not have strings, pipes, or metal tines. A synthesizer keyboard creates musical sounds using electronic circuitry, or, later, [[computer chip]]s and [[software]]. Synthesizers became popular in the mass market in the early 1980s. With the development of powerful [[microchip]]s, a number of new electronic or digital music technologies were introduced in the 1980s and subsequent decades, including [[drum machine]]s and [[music sequencer]]s. Electronic and digital music technologies are any device, such as a computer, an electronic [[effects unit]] or [[software]], that is used by a musician or composer to help make or perform music.&lt;ref name="m:tech educational services"&gt;{{cite web|last=m:tech educational services|title=What is Music Technology?|url=http://www.mtechonline.co.uk/schools/what-is-music-technology.html|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]] that is used in the [[performance]], playback, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[Music informatics|analysis]] and [[Digital audio editor|editing]] of music.

Findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old.

===References in the Bible===
{{Main article|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|right|170px|"David with his harp", from the [[Paris Psalter]], c. 960, [[Constantinople]].]]

According to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. In addition to those, there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|[[Miriam]] and women celebrate the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] with "timbrels" (small hand drums) (from the [[Tomić Psalter]]).]]
Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], [[flute]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}} There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|2}} Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]]. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[hydraulis]]'' or "water organ". Note the curved trumpet, called the ''bukanē'' by the Greeks and, later, ''cornu'' by the Romans.]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:

*the [[lyre]]: a strummed and occasionally [[plucked string instrument]], essentially a hand-held [[zither]] built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song.
*the [[kithara]], also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the [[lyre]]. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the [[sounding box]] at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a [[plectrum]]. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.
* the ''[[aulos]]'', usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds.
* the [[Pan pipes]], also known as panflute and [[syrinx]] (Greek συριγξ), (so-called for the nymph  who was changed into a reed in order to hide from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top).
* the [[hydraulis]], a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius &lt;ref&gt;''De Architectura'' x, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Heron of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatica'', I, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'',  Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the [[Ancient Roman music|music of ancient Rome]].

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Musicians from Zliten mosaic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.7|Musicians in a detail from the [[Zliten mosaic]] (2nd century AD), originally shown as accompanying [[gladiator]] combat and wild-animal events in the arena: from left, the ''tuba'', ''hydraulis'' (water pipe organ), and two ''cornua'']]
The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. [[Roman art]] depicts various [[woodwind]]s, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], [[percussion]] and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

Roman instruments include:
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze [[trumpet]] with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] - αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''capistrum'' to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} 
*The ''[[askaules]]'' — a [[bagpipe]].
*Versions of the modern [[flute]] and [[panpipes]].
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute  in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}
* The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The ''hydraulis'' accompanied [[gladiator]] contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. 
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device, called a [[scabellum]] used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and [[tambourine]]s.
*[[Drum]] and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. 
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of notation for the [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'', which originated in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi. ''Gregorian Chant''. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
During the [[Medieval Music|medieval music]] era (476 to 1400) the [[plainchant]] tunes used for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single line, unaccompanied melody). In the early centuries of the medieval era, these chants were taught and spread by oral tradition ("by ear"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to standardize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. Various signs written above the chant texts, called ''[[neumes]]'' were introduced. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was "heighted neumes", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval as well as the direction.

This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d’ Arezzo]] (c. 1000-1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages.  It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes or playing of melodies. The development of music notation made it faster and easier to teach melodies to new people, and facilitated the spread of music over long geographic distances.
[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|140 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310-1320]]
Instruments used to perform medieval music include earlier, less mechanically sophisticated versions of a number of instruments that continue to be used in the 2010s. Medieval instruments include the [[flute]], which was made of [[wood]] and could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument (it lacked the complex metal keys and airtight pads of 2010s-era metal flutes); the wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the related instrument called the [[gemshorn]]; and the [[pan flute]] (a group of air columns attached together). Medieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.

Bowed strings were used as well. The bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]] as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rabāb]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' ([[Organ (music)|organ]]), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|(1990)|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was a mechanical [[violin]] using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to "bow" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jaw harp]] were also popular in the time. Early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) existed in the medieval era.

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area.

Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary.
*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet.
*[[Trumpet]]: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. They were also made in different sizes.
*[[Sackbut]]: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century

Stringed instruments included:
*[[Viol]]: This instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly has six strings. It was usually played with a bow.
*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small [[harp]], although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum. Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
*[[Hurdy-gurdy]]: (Also known as the wheel fiddle), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its "drone strings" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
*[[Gittern]] and [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]]: these instruments were used throughout Europe. Forerunners of modern instruments including the [[mandolin]] and [[acoustic guitar]].

Percussion instruments included:
*[[Tambourine]]: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck.
*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth.

Woodwind instruments included:

*[[Shawm]]: A typical shawm is keyless and is about a foot long with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were also most commonly made of wood and many of them had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular double reed instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the predecessor of the [[saxophone]] and the [[clarinet]].
*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.
*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
*[[Transverse flute]]: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.
*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

===Baroque===
During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (ca. 1600-1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of [[pipe organ]]s and [[harpsichord]]s, and to the development of the first [[piano]]s. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors. Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the [[viol|viola da gamba]]. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's "golden age," as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as [[Arp Schnitger]], Jasper Johannsen, [[Zacharias Hildebrandt]] and [[Gottfried Silbermann]] constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large Pedal and Rückpositiv divisions.

Harpsichord builders in the [[Southern Netherlands]] built instruments with two keyboards which could be used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]]. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound.  Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] choirs, adding to the lower register and [[eight foot pitch|two foot]] choirs, which added to the upper register.

The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]]. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[clavichord]] allowed expressive control of volume, with harder or louder key presses creating  louder sound (and vice versa) and fairly sustained notes, it was too quiet for large performances. The [[harpsichord]] produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. Pressing a harpsichord key harder or softer had no effect on the instrument's loudness. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control. Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would [[Damping|damp]] the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano [[Action (piano)|action]] was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more [[sustain]] than the clavichord. Even though the piano was invented in 1700, the harpsichord and pipe organ continued to be widely used in orchestra and chamber music concerts until the end of the 1700s. It took time for the new piano to gain in popularity. By 1800, though, the piano generally was used in place of the harpsichord (although pipe organ continued to be used in church music such as Masses).

===Classicism===

From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era [[piano]] underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing [[Industrial Revolution]] with resources such as high-quality [[steel]] [[piano wire]] for [[Strings (music)|strings]], and precision [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] for the production of [[Cast iron|iron frames]]. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five [[octave]]s of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.
Early technological progress owed much to the firm of [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]]. [[John Broadwood]] joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, [[Americus Backers]], to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the "grand". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.

They sent pianos to both [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a [[Interval (music)|fifth (interval)]] during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

[[Beethoven]]'s instrumentation for [[orchestra]] added [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s  to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver storm and sunshine in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth]]. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] expanded the sound of the orchestra.

===Romanticism===
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in [[chamber music]] groups, such as [[string quartet]]s. [[Saxophone]]s began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]]. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to [[Paris]], where the [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] firm manufactured pianos used by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the Érard firm manufactured those used by [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, [[Sébastien Érard]] invented the double escapement [[Action (piano)|action]], which incorporated a ''repetition lever'' (also called the ''balancier'') that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by [[Henri Herz]], the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.
Other improvements of the mechanism included the use of felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by [[Jean-Henri Pape]] in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The [[Sostenuto|sostenuto pedal]], invented in 1844 by [[Jean-Louis Boisselot]] and copied by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

One innovation that helped create the sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string [[Tension (physics)|tension]] that can exceed 20 tons in a modern grand. The single piece cast iron frame was [[patent]]ed in 1825 in [[Boston]] by [[Alpheus Babcock]],&lt;ref name="isacoff"&gt;Isacoff (2012, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of [[Birmingham]] brought out a form of piano wire made from [[cast steel]]; according to Dolge it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."&lt;ref name="Dolge"&gt;Dolge (1911, 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] height. The mechanical action structure of the [[upright piano]] was invented in London, England in 1826 by [[Robert Wornum]], and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri, ed.|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93796-2|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th- and 21st-century music===
{{Main article|20th-century music}}
With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening, as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on [[rock music]], because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their [[music producer]] could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. In the 2000s, the modern orchestra became standardized with the modern instrumentation that includes a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], and even, for some 20th century or 21st century works, electric instruments such as [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]] and/or electronic instruments such as the [[Theremin]] or [[synthesizer]].

==Electric and electro-mechanical==
{{Main article|Music technology (electric)}}
Electric music technology refers to [[musical instrument]]s and [[Sound recording|recording device]]s that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical [[electric piano]] (invented in 1929), the [[electric guitar]] (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical [[Hammond organ]] (developed in 1934) and the [[electric bass]] (invented in 1935). None of these electric instruments produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker cabinet]]s, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a [[guitar amplifier]]), electric bass (which uses a [[bass amplifier]]) and some electric organs (which use a [[Leslie speaker]] or similar cabinet) and electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument.

===Electric piano===
[[File:Rhodes Mk II 73 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A [[Fender Rhodes|Rhodes Mark II Stage 73]] electric piano.]]
An [[electric piano]] is an electric [[musical instrument]] which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]]. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], which are then connected to an [[instrument amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a [[synthesizer]], the electric piano is not an [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s.

===Electric guitar===
[[File:Kramer_XKG-20_sm.jpg|thumb|right|130px|A [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980.]]
An [[electric guitar]] is a [[guitar]] that uses a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct [[electromagnetic induction]]. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a [[loudspeaker]], so it is [[Guitar amplifier|amplified]] before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using [[Effects unit|electronic effect]]s such as [[reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|distortion]]. Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as [[jazz]] guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the [[big band]] format.

===Hammond organ===
[[File:Hammond c3 Emilio Muñoz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hammond C-3 electric organ.]]

The [[Hammond organ]] is an [[electronic organ#Early electric organs|electric organ]], invented by [[Laurens Hammond]] and John M. Hanert{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=168}} and first manufactured in 1935.{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=151}} Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal [[tonewheel]] near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the [[Leslie speaker]]. The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to [[Church (building)|churches]] as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven [[pipe organ]], or instead of a [[piano]]. It quickly became popular with professional [[jazz]] [[bandleader]]s, who found that the room-filling sound of a Hammond organ could form small bands such as [[organ trio]]s which were less costly than paying an entire [[big band]].

===Electric bass===
The [[electric bass]] (or bass guitar) was invented in the 1930s, but it did not become commercially successful or widely used until the 1950s. It is a [[stringed instrument]] played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an [[electric guitar]], but with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[scale (string instruments)|scale]] length, and four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. The electric bass usually uses metal strings and an [[electromagnetic pickup]] which senses the vibrations in the strings. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.

==Electronic or digital==
{{Main article|Music technology (electronic and digital)}}
Electronic or digital music technology is any device, such as a [[computer]], an electronic [[effects unit]] or [[software]], that is used by a [[musician]] or [[composer]] to help make or perform [[music]].&lt;ref name="m:tech educational services"/&gt; The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, [[computer hardware]] and [[computer software]] that is used in the [[performance]], playback, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[Music informatics|analysis]] and [[Digital audio editor|editing]] of music. Electronic or digital music technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as [[digital audio workstation]]s and [[Protools]] digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the [[Music technology (electric)|electric music technologies]] of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the [[Ontology|ontological]] range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual.

[[File:R.A.Moog minimoog 2.jpg|thumb|right|An early [[Minimoog]] synthesizer by R.A. Moog Inc. from 1970.]]
A [[synthesizer]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Synthesizers may either [[#Imitative synthesis|imitate existing sounds]] (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic [[timbres]] or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic [[musical keyboard]], but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including [[music sequencers]], [[MIDI controller|instrument controllers]], [[#Fingerboard controller|fingerboards]], [[guitar synthesizer]]s, [[wind controller]]s, and [[electronic drum]]s. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called [[sound modules]], and are controlled using a controller device.

[[Image:Navestopicalbible.JPG|thumb|Nave's Topical Bible]]
'''Nave's Topical Bible''' is a book written by [[Orville Nave|Orville James Nave]] (1841–1917) and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]. Nave was a chaplain in the United States Army and referred to his work as "the result of fourteen years of delight and untiring study of the Word of God." &lt;ref name="christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.christianity.com/Concordances/|title= Nave's Topical Bible|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topical [[concordance of the Bible]], and contains Biblical references to over 20,000 topics. Scripture is quoted over 100,000 times; the same Scripture citation may appear under several headings.

The topic headings are broad, covering many religious concepts, geographical regions, and names of Biblical figures. While [[theological]] concepts such as [[salvation]] and [[worship]] are included, a wide range of topics, such as Biblical references to [[rope]]s, are also included. This reflects the author's intention, as stated in the book's [[preface]], to "...note and classify everything found in the Scriptures".

The book took fourteen years to complete. Its original copyrights were 1896 and 1897. Until at least 1907 the book was published by the Topical Bible Publishing Company of Lincoln Nebraska. At least seven editions have been published, based on the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Version]] of the Bible. Each verse of the Bible is indexed according to the topics it is classified under. Christian figures such as [[Billy Graham]] have endorsed the book.

'''Plant anatomy''' or '''phytotomy''' is the general term for the study of the internal [[Anatomy|structure]] of [[plant]]s.

== History ==
{{Main article|History of botany}}
About 300 BC [[Theophrastus]] wrote a number of plant treatises, only two of which survive, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' (Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία), and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (Περὶ φυτῶν αἰτιῶν). He developed concepts of plant morphology and classification, which did not withstand the scientific scrutiny of the [[Renaissance]].

A Swiss physician and botanist, [[Gaspard Bauhin]], introduced [[binomial nomenclature]] into plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. He published ''Pinax theatri botanici'' in 1596, which was the first to use this convention for naming of species. His criteria for classification included natural relationships, or 'affinities', which in many cases were structural.

It was in the late 1600s that plant anatomy became refined into a modern science. Italian doctor and microscopist, [[Marcello Malpighi]], was one of the two founders of plant anatomy. In 1671 he published his ''Anatomia Plantarum'', the first major advance in plant physiogamy since [[Aristotle]]. The other founder was the British doctor [[Nehemiah Grew]]. He published ''An Idea of a Philosophical History of Plants'' in 1672 and ''The Anatomy of Plants'' in 1682. Grew is credited with the recognition of plant cells, although he called them 'vesicles' and 'bladders'. He correctly identified and described the sexual organs of plants (flowers) and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bolam, J. |year=1973|title= The botanical works of Nehemiah Grew, FRS (1641-1712)|journal= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=27|issue=2|pages=219–231|jstor=530999|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1973.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighteenth century, [[Carl Linnaeus]] established taxonomy based on structure, and his early work was with plant anatomy. While the exact structural level which is to be considered to be scientifically valid for comparison and differentiation has changed with the growth of knowledge, the basic principles were established by Linnaeus. He published his master work, ''Species Plantarum'' in 1753.

In 1802, French botanist [[Charles-François Brisseau de Mirbel]], published ''Traité d'anatomie et de physiologie végétale'' (''Treatise on Plant Anatomy and Physiology'') establishing the beginnings of the science of plant [[Cell biology|cytology]].

In 1812, [[Johann Jacob Paul Moldenhawer]] published ''Beyträge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen'', describing microscopic studies of plant tissues.

In 1813 a Swiss botanist, [[A. P. de Candolle|Augustin Pyrame de Candolle]], published ''Théorie élémentaire de la botanique'', in which he argued that plant anatomy, not physiology, ought to be the sole basis for plant classification. Using a scientific basis, he established structural criteria for defining and separating plant genera.

In 1830, [[Franz Meyen]] published ''Phytotomie'', the first comprehensive review of plant anatomy.

In 1838 German botanist [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]], published ''Contributions to Phytogenesis'', stating, "the lower plants all consist of one cell, while the higher plants are composed of (many) individual cells" thus confirming and continuing Mirbel's work.

A German-Polish botanist, [[Eduard Strasburger]], described the mitotic process in plant cells and further demonstrated that new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other pre-existing nuclei. His ''Studien über Protoplasma'' was published in 1876.

[[Gottlieb Haberlandt]], a German botanist, studied plant physiology and classified plant tissue based upon function. On this basis, in 1884 he published ''Physiologische Pflanzenanatomie'' (''Physiological Plant Anatomy'') in which he described twelve types of tissue systems (absorptive, mechanical, photosynthetic, etc.).

British paleobotanists [[Dunkinfield Henry Scott]] and [[William Crawford Williamson]] described the structures of fossilized plants at the end of the nineteenth century. Scott's ''Studies in Fossil Botany'' was published in 1900.

Following [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''Origin of Species'' a Canadian botanist, [[E. C. Jeffrey|Edward Charles Jeffrey]], who was studying the comparative anatomy and phylogeny of different [[vascular plant]] groups, applied the theory to plants using the form and structure of plants to establish a number of evolutionary lines. He published his ''The Anatomy of Woody Plants'' in 1917.

The growth of comparative plant anatomy was spearheaded by British botanist [[Agnes Arber]]. She published ''Water Plants: A Study of Aquatic Angiosperms'' in 1920, ''Monocotyledons: A Morphological Study'' in 1925, and ''The Gramineae: A Study of Cereal, Bamboo and Grass'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas, Hanshaw H.|year=1960|title=Agnes Arber, 1879–1960|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=6| pages=1&amp;ndash;11|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0021|jstor=769330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], [[Katherine Esau]] published, ''Plant Anatomy'' (1953), which became the definitive textbook on plant structure in North American universities and elsewhere, it was still in print as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaffey|first=N.|title=(Book Review) Esau's Plant Anatomy, Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: their Structure, Function, and Development. 3rd edn.|journal=Annals of Botany|year=2006|volume=99|issue=4|pages=785–786|doi=10.1093/aob/mcm015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She followed up with her ''Anatomy of seed plants'' in 1960.

'''rCOS'''  stands for refinement of  [[Object (philosophy)|object]] and [[Software component|component]] systems. It is a [[formal method]] providing [[component-based]] [[model-driven software]] development.

==Overview==
rCOS was originally developed by [[He Jifeng]], [[Zhiming Liu (computer scientist)|Zhiming Liu]] and Xiaoshan Li at [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]], and consists of a unified multi-view modeling notation with a theory of relational semantic and graph-based [[operational semantics]], a [[refinement calculus]] and tool support for model construction, model analysis and verification, and [[model transformation]]s. Model transformations automate refinement rules and design patterns and generate conditions as proof obligations.  rCOS support multiple dimensional modeling: models at different levels of abstraction related by refinement relations, hierarchy of compositions of components, and models of different views of the system ([[interaction protocol]]s of components, reactive behaviors of components, data functionality, and class structures and data types). Components are composed and integrated based on their models of interfaces to support third party composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |title=rCOS |work=[[UNU-IIST]] |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |date=2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113133741/http://rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''ranked alphabet''' is a pair of an [[Alphabet (computer science)|ordinary alphabet]] ''F'' and a function ''Arity'': ''F''→ℕ. Each letter in ''F'' has its [[arity]] so it can be used to build [[Term (logic)|terms]]. Nullary elements (of zero arity) are also called '''constants'''. Terms built with unary symbols and constants can be considered as [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Higher arities lead to proper [[Tree (automata theory)|trees]].

For instance, in the term 
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,g(a),f(a,b,c))&lt;/math&gt;,
''a,b,c'' are constants, ''g'' is unary, and ''f'' is ternary.

Contrariwise,  
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be a valid term, as the symbol ''f'' appears once as binary, and once as unary, which is illicit, as ''Arity'' must be a function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">'''Rational mysticism''', which encompasses both [[rationalism]] and [[mysticism]], is a term used by [[Academia|scholars]], [[Scientific method|researchers]], and other [[intellectual]]s, some of whom engage in studies of how [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] or [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Colloquial usage|transcendence]] such as [[trance]], [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], and [[prayer]] occur. Lines of investigation include [[History|historical]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[inquiry]] as well as [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] within such fields as [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]].

==Overview==
The term "rational mysticism" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the ''[[Harvard Theological Review]].''&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;  In a 1924 book, ''Rational Mysticism,''  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific [[idealism]].&lt;ref name="KingslandBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingslandTheosophy"/&gt;  South African philosopher [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] frequently used the term, developing the theme in ''Ascent to the Absolute'' and other works in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="WilberBook"/&gt;

Columbia University [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Herman Randall, Jr.]] characterized both [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] as “rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism” in his 1970 book ''Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis.''&lt;ref name="RandallPlotinos"/&gt;  
Rice University professor of [[religious studies]] [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]], in his 2001 book ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom,'' defined rational mysticism as “not a contradiction in terms” but “a mysticism whose limits are set by reason.”&lt;ref name="KripalBook"/&gt;

In response to criticism of his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.&lt;ref name="HarrisEssay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NandaWheels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroNYPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroABC"/&gt;  University of Pennsylvania [[Neurotheology|neurotheologist]] [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]] has been using [[nuclear medicine]] [[brain imaging]] in similar research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="NewbergCNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewbergForum"/&gt;

Executive editor of ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine Corey S. Powell, in his 2002 book, ''God in the Equation,''   attributed the term to [[Albert Einstein]]: “In creating his radical cosmology, Einstein stitched together a rational mysticism, drawing on—but distinct from—the views that came before.”&lt;ref name="PowellBook"/&gt;

Science writer [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] interviewed and profiled [[James H. Austin|James Austin]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Christian Rätsch]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Ken Wilber]] and others for ''Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality,''&lt;ref name="TeresiReview"/&gt;  his 2003 study of “the scientific quest to explain the transcendent.”&lt;ref name="McCauleyBook"/&gt;

'''Recombineering''' ('''recombi'''nation-mediated genetic engi'''neering''')&lt;ref name="Ellis, H. M. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ellis H. M., Yu D., DiTizio T., Court D. L. | year = 2001 | title = High efficiency mutagenesis, repair, and engineering of chromosomal DNA using single-stranded oligonucleotides | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recombineering is widely used for bacterial genetics, in the generation of target vectors for making a conditional [[Knockout mouse|mouse knockout]], and for modifying DNA of any source often contained on a [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] (BAC), among other applications.

==Development==
Although developed in bacteria, much of the inspiration for recombineering techniques came from methods first developed in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] &lt;ref&gt;Orr-Weaver, T. L., J. W. Szostak, et al. (1983) Genetic applications of yeast transformation with linear and gapped plasmids. Methods. Enzymol. 101: 228-245.&lt;/ref&gt; where a linear plasmid was used to target genes or clone genes off the chromosome.  In addition, recombination with single-strand [[oligonucleotides]] (oligos) was first shown in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moerschell R. P., Tsunasawa S. ''et al.'' | year = 1988 | title = Transformation of yeast with synthetic oligonucleotides | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 85 | issue = 2| pages = 524–528 | doi=10.1073/pnas.85.2.524| pmc = 279583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination was observed to take place with oligonucleotides as short as 20 bases.
  
Recombineering is based on homologous recombination in ''Escherichia coli'' mediated by [[bacteriophage]] proteins, either RecE/RecT from Rac prophage &lt;ref name="stewart-1998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang Y., Buchholz F., Muyrers J. P., Stewart A.

C. | year = 1998 | title = Use of bacteriophage λ recombination functions to promote gene replacement in Escherichia coli | url = | journal = J.

Consequently the implications for a new DNA engineering technology were not obvious. The Stewart lab showed that these homologous recombination systems mediate efficient recombination of linear DNA molecules flanked by homology sequences as short as 30 base pairs (40-50 base pairs are more efficient) into target [[DNA]] sequences in the absence of RecA. Now the homology could be provided by oligonucleotides made to order, and standard ''recA'' cloning hosts could be used, greatly expanding the utility of recombineering.

==Recombineering with dsDNA==
Recombineering utilizes linear DNA substrates that are either double-stranded (dsDNA) or single-stranded (ssDNA). Most commonly, dsDNA recombineering has been used to create gene replacements, deletions, insertions, and inversions. Gene cloning &lt;ref name="M. Ellis, 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Zhang, Y., Muyrers, J.P.P., Testa, G. and Stewart, A.F. (2000) DNA cloning by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli Nature Biotechnology 18, 1314 - 1317&lt;/ref&gt; and gene/protein tagging (His tags etc., see &lt;ref&gt;Poser I, Sarov M, Hutchins JR, Hériché JK, Toyoda Y, Pozniakovsky A, Weigl D, Nitzsche A, Hegemann B, Bird AW, Pelletier L, Kittler R, Hua S, Naumann R, Augsburg M, Sykora MM, Hofemeister H, Zhang Y, Nasmyth K, White KP, Dietzel S, Mechtler K, Durbin R, Stewart AF, Peters JM, Buchholz F, Hyman AA. (2008) BAC TransgeneOmics: a high-throughput method for exploration of protein function in mammals. Nat Methods. 5:409-15.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also common. For gene replacements or deletions, usually a cassette encoding a drug-resistance gene is made by PCR using bi-partite primers. These primers consist of (from 5’→3’) 50 bases of homology to the target region, where the cassette is to be inserted, followed by 20 bases to prime the drug resistant cassette. The exact junction sequence of the final construct is determined by primer design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sawitzke J. A., Thomason L. C., Costantino N., Bubunenko M., Datta S., Court D.

&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically occur at a frequency of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;cells that survive [[electroporation]]. Electroporation is the method used to transform the linear substrate into the recombining cell.

===Selection/counterselection technique===
In some cases, one desires a deletion with no marker left behind, to make a gene fusion, or to make a point mutant in a gene.  This can be done with two rounds of recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid24203710"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage of recombineering, a selection marker on a cassette is introduced to replace the region to be modified. In the second stage, a second counterselection marker (e.g. sacB) on the cassette is selected against following introduction of a target fragment containing the desired modification. Alternatively, the target fragment could be flanked by ''[[Cre-Lox Recombination|loxP]]'' or ''[[FLP-FRT Recombination|FRT]]'' sites, which could be removed later simply by the expression of the [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] or FLP recombinases, respectively.
A novel selection marker "mFabI" was also developed to increase recombineering efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057075 A Novel Selection Marker for Efficient DNA Cloning and Recombineering in E. coli]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recombineering with ssDNA==
Recombineering with ssDNA provided a breakthrough both in the efficiency of the reaction and the ease of making point mutations.&lt;ref name="Ellis, H. M. 2001"/&gt; This technique was further enhanced by the discovery that by avoiding the methyl-directed mismatch repair system, the frequency of obtaining recombinants can be increased to over 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; viable cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costantino N., Court D. L. | year = 2003 | title = Enhanced levels of λ Red-mediated recombinants in mismatch repair mutants | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

With optimized protocols, over 50% of the cells that survive electroporation contain the desired change. Recombineering with ssDNA only requires the Red Beta protein; Exo, Gamma and the host recombination proteins are not required. As proteins homologous to Beta and RecT are found in many bacteria and bacteriophages (&gt;100 as of February 2010), recombineering is likely to work in many different bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Datta S., Costantino N., Zhou X., Court D.

== Red-Independent recombination ==

In the year 2010, it has been demonstrated that ssDNA recombination can occur in the absence of known recombination functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Swingle B., Markel E., Costantino N., Bubunenko M. G., Cartinhour S., Court D. L. | year = 2010 | title = Oligonucleotide recombination in Gram-negative bacteria | url = | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 138–148 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06976.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombinants were found at up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; viable cells. This Red-independent activity has been demonstrated in ''P. syringae'', ''E. coli'', ''S. enterica serovar typhimurium'' and ''S. flexneria''.

==Applications and benefits of recombineering==
The biggest advantage of recombineering is that it obviates the need for conveniently positioned [[Restriction enzyme|restriction sites]], whereas in conventional genetic engineering, DNA modification is often compromised by the availability of unique restriction sites. In engineering large constructs of &gt;100 kb, such as the [[Bacterial Artificial Chromosome]]s (BACs), or chromosomes, recombineering has become a necessity. Recombineering can generate the desired modifications without leaving any 'footprints' behind. It also forgoes multiple [[cloning]] stages for generating intermediate [[Vector DNA|vectors]] and therefore is used to modify DNA constructs in a relatively short time-frame. The homology required is short enough that it can be generated in synthetic oligonucleotides and recombination with short oligonucleotides themselves is incredibly efficient. Recently, recombineering has been developed for high throughput DNA engineering applications termed 'recombineering pipelines'.&lt;ref&gt;Sarov, M., S. Schneider, A. Pozniakovski, A. Roguev, S. Ernst, Y. Zhang, A. A. Hyman &amp; A. F. Stewart, (2006) A recombineering pipeline for functional genomics applied to Caenorhabditis elegans. Nat Methods 3: 839-844.
&lt;/ref&gt; Recombineering pipelines support the large scale production of BAC [[transgenes]] and [[gene targeting]] constructs for functional genomics programs such as EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium) and KOMP (Knock-Out Mouse Program). Recombineering has also been automated, a process called "MAGE" -Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering, in the Church lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang H.H., Isaacs F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">[[Image:Rosenbrock function.svg|thumb|right|300 px|Plot of the Rosenbrock function of two variables. Here &lt;math&gt;a=1, b=100&lt;/math&gt;, and the minimum value of zero is at &lt;math&gt;(1,1)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Rosenbrock function''' is a non-[[convex function]], introduced by [[Howard Harry Rosenbrock|Howard H. Rosenbrock]] in 1960, which is used as a [[Test functions for optimization|performance test problem]] for optimization [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbrock|first=H.H.|title=An automatic method for finding the greatest or least value of a function|journal=The Computer Journal|year=1960|volume=3|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1093/comjnl/3.3.175| issn=0010-4620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Rosenbrock's valley''' or '''Rosenbrock's banana function'''.

The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, [[parabola|parabolic]] shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global [[minimum]], however, is difficult.

The function is defined by

&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = (a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

It has a global minimum at &lt;math&gt;(x, y)=(a, a^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Usually these parameters are set such that &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = 100&lt;/math&gt;. Only in the trivial case where &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; is the function symmetric and the minimum at the origin.

==Multidimensional generalisations==

Two variants are commonly encountered.  

[[File:Rosenbrock3.gif|thumb|300px|Animation of Rosenbrock's function of three variables. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simionescu|first=P.A.|title=Computer Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD users|year=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-5290-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One is the sum of &lt;math&gt;N/2&lt;/math&gt; uncoupled 2D Rosenbrock problems, and is defined only for even &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;s:
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N/2} \left[100(x_{2i-1}^2 - x_{2i})^2
+ (x_{2i-1} - 1)^2 \right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. C. W. |last=Dixon |first2=D. J. |last2=Mills |title=Effect of Rounding Errors on the Variable Metric Method |journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications |volume=80 |issue= |year=1994 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=179711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant has predictably simple solutions.

A second, more involved variant is
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} [100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2 )^2 + (1-x_i)^2] \quad \mbox{where} \quad \mathbf{x} = [x_1, \ldots, x_N] \in \mathbb{R}^N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/tutorial/optimize.html#unconstrained-minimization-of-multivariate-scalar-functions-minimize|title = Generalized Rosenbrock's function|accessdate = 2008-09-16|work = |publisher = |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

has exactly one minimum for &lt;math&gt;N=3&lt;/math&gt; (at &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;) and exactly two minima for &lt;math&gt;4 \le N \le 7&lt;/math&gt;—the global minimum of all ones and a local minimum near &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = (-1, 1, \dots, 1)&lt;/math&gt;.  This result is obtained by setting the gradient of the function equal to zero, noticing that the resulting equation is a rational function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  For small &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the polynomials can be determined exactly and [[Sturm's theorem]] can be used to determine the number of real roots, while the roots can be [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#Bounds on the zeroes of a polynomial|bounded]] in the region of &lt;math&gt;|x_i| &lt; 2.4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kok2009"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Schalk |last=Kok |first2=Carl |last2=Sandrock |title=Locating and Characterizing the Stationary Points of the Extended Rosenbrock Function |journal=Evolutionary Computation |volume=17 |issue= 3|pages=437 |year=2009 |doi=10.1162/evco.2009.17.3.437 |pmid=19708775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For larger &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; this method breaks down due to the size of the coefficients involved.

==Stationary points==

Many of the stationary points of the function exhibit a regular pattern when plotted.&lt;ref name="kok2009"/&gt;  This structure can be exploited to locate them.
[[Image:Rosenbrock roots exhibiting hump structures.pdf|thumb|right|300 px|Rosenbrock roots exhibiting hump structures]]

==Optimization examples==

[[File:Nelder-Mead Rosenbrock.gif|thumb|200px|text-top|left|alt=Rosenbrock function Nelder-Mead|Nelder-Mead method applied to the Rosenbrock function]]

The Rosenbrock function can be efficiently optimized by adapting appropriate coordinate system without using any [[gradient descent|gradient information]] and without building local approximation models (in contrast to many derivate-free optimizers). The following figure illustrates an example of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function optimization by
[[adaptive coordinate descent]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-3,-4)&lt;/math&gt;. The solution with the function value &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; can be found after 325 function evaluations.

Using the [[Nelder–Mead method]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; with a regular initial simplex a minimum is found with function value &lt;math&gt;1.36 \cdot 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; after 185 function evaluations. The figure below visualizes the evolution of the algorithm.

'''Seattle Pacific University''' ('''SPU''') is a private liberal arts university in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], founded in 1891 in conjunction with the Oregon and Washington Conference of the [[Free Methodist Church]] as the Seattle Seminary. It became the Seattle Seminary and College in 1913, adopting the name Seattle Pacific College in 1915, and took its present moniker in 1977. Seattle Pacific University is a member of the [[Christian College Consortium]].

==History==

Seattle Pacific University was founded in 1891 by Free Methodist pioneers to train missionaries for overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spu.edu/about-spu/our-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2014, a shooting occurred in Otto Miller Hall in which one student was killed and two other students were injured. The suspect was not a student at the school and had no connection to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Lee: a young man with ‘infectious positive attitude’|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023788281_spulee1xml.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman was stopped by student Jon Meis, who used pepper spray to disarm the gunman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/court-releases-video-from-spu-shooting-showing-students-heroic-actions/244202869|title=Court releases video from SPU shooting showing student's heroic actions|work=KING|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meis received a Citizen Honors award from the [[Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the United States of America|Congressional Medal of Honor Society]] in 2015 for his work in stopping the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://q13fox.com/2015/03/25/2-washington-residents-including-spu-shooting-hero-honored-by-congressional-medal-of-honor-society/|title=2 Washington residents, including SPU shooting hero, honored by Congressional Medal of Honor Society|date=2015-03-26|work=Q13 FOX News|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2016, the gunman was convicted in the shooting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2016/11/16/jury-convicts-man-in-fatal-shooting-at-seattle-university/|title=Man Found Guilty In Fatal Shooting At Seattle University|work=CBS Seattle|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 112 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/aaron-ybarra-sentenced-to-112-years-for-deadly-shooting-at-seattle-pacific-university/|title=Aaron Ybarra sentenced to 112 years for deadly shooting at Seattle Pacific University|work=The Seattle Times|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle Pacific is tied for 151st in the 2018 ''U.S. News and World Report''{{'s}} Best National Universities rankings; it is the only private university in the Pacific Northwest to make that list, and the only [[Christian College Consortium]] member to be ranked a Best National University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/seattle-pacific-university-3788|title=Seattle Pacific University - U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318083945/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/seattle-pacific-university-3788|archive-date=2017-03-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPU joins the [[University of Washington]] and [[Washington State University]] as the only three institutions from Washington state named to the magazine’s list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spu.edu/about-spu/news/articles/2016/oct/best-national-univ-usnwr-hero-image|title=A "Best National University"  - Seattle Pacific University|website=spu.edu|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors program===
SPU offers a four-year alternate series of [[Curriculum#United States 2|general education]] classes for honors students called University Scholars that revolves around a [[Great Books]] reading list and the writing of a lengthy senior dissertation [http://spu.edu/academics/university-scholars/honors-projects]. Along with literature classes, the curriculum includes two Faith &amp; Science classes and a Christianity &amp; Scholarship class. The work load is generally very rigorous.

A student in the program will take his or her sequence of University Scholars courses with the same cohort of 40 students for the entire four years. A student may be admitted to the program regardless of major. Students apply in the spring of their senior year of college; a few students are invited into the program after their freshman year at SPU. There are no University Scholars classes scheduled for the fall of their junior year, in order to give students the opportunity to study abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= University Scholars - Seattle Pacific University|url = http://spu.edu/academics/university-scholars |website= spu.edu |accessdate= 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:SPU Campus.jpg|thumb|SPU Tiffany Loop]]
The university sits on a 43-acre campus at the northern end of [[Queen Anne, Seattle|Queen Anne Hill]], near the [[Fremont, Seattle, Washington|Fremont]] neighborhood and approximately four miles north of downtown Seattle. Many of the trees on the campus' central Tiffany Loop are among the oldest in the city. SPU also owns and operates two [[satellite]] campuses: a wilderness field station specializing in [[biology]] on [[Blakely Island]] in the [[San Juan Islands]] and Camp Casey, a former US military [[fort]] re-purposed as a conference and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] facility on [[Whidbey Island]]. Notable buildings on the Seattle campus include:

===Alexander Hall===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Alexander Hall 04.jpg|thumb|Alexander Hall]]
[[File:Seattle Pacific University McKinley Theater 01.jpg|thumb|McKinley Theater]]
Named for the first president of Seattle Pacific University, Alexander Beers, this four-story brick building is home to the School of Theology. The founder's first name, Alexander, was used, as the board did not want a building on campus called "Beers Hall." The building also houses the Sociology and History departments within the College of Arts and Sciences. Alexander Hall is the oldest building on campus, and at the time of the University's founding was the only building on campus. A $6.2-million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Hall Campaign|url=http://spu.edu/give-to-spu/alexander|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic retrofitting and renovation of the interior office space and chapel was completed in 2014. Next door to Alexander is the main performing arts space on campus, the McKinley Theater.

===Demaray Hall/Clocktower===
Demaray Hall is the central academic building at Seattle Pacific University, housing numerous classrooms as well as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Student Academic Services and Student Financial Services. Administrative offices, including the offices of the president and provost, are also located in Demaray.  The building is named for Calvin Dorr Demaray, president of SPU from 1959-1968 and pastor of First Free Methodist Church, from 1948 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcdermott|first=Terry|title=C. Dorr Demaray, 91; College Expanded During His Presidency|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921104&amp;slug=1522615|accessdate=March 25, 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clocktower in front of Demaray Hall was given to Seattle Pacific University by the class of 1966. It displays a bas-relief sculpture designed by former Professor of Art Ernst Schwidder, titled "Science, Religion and Humanities," which was brought to fruition by former Professor of Art Larry Metcalf and three of his students. The cast-stone relief panels depict various areas of study: the physical sciences, social sciences and humanities. Its symbols are drawn from American Pima, Arabic, Aztec, Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPU Arts Guide|url=http://www.spu.edu/news/artsguide/artsGuide.asp?id=15|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.spu.edu/archives_publications_spc/1/ "Demaray Hall Pamphlet" by Seattle Pacific College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gwinn Commons===
[[File:Spu gwinn.jpg|thumb|right|Gwinn Commons]]
Gwinn Commons is home to three different points of interest. The Crossroads at Gwinn Commons is the main dining hall on campus. Upstairs is the university's main, multi-use location. A pair of large rooms, the Queen Anne Room (named after the neighborhood in which SPU is located) and the Cascade Room (named after the [[Cascade Range|mountain range]] that can be seen from Upper Gwinn Commons) can each hold up to 500 people. Multiple functions are held in Upper Gwinn, ranging from Group (a Wednesday night worship service), admissions events, lectures, board meetings and more. The President's Dining room is also located here. In addition, there is the Corner Place Market, or C-Store, which holds Cocina Del Sol and also a market where students can purchase various daily necessities. Wells Gwinn, for whom the dining facility is named, served 32 years on the Seattle Pacific Board of Trustees.

=== Ames Library===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Library.jpg|thumb|Ames Library (View from Lower Campus)]]
The Ames Library was completed in 1994. Housing over 250,000 volumes and 1,300 print [[periodicals]], it grows by 6,000 new titles a year. Students, faculty, and alumni have access to the collections of Summit and the [[Orbis Cascade Alliance]], comprising over 30 million items held in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] academic [[library|libraries]], including the [[University of Washington]]. In addition to printed [[reference]] materials, the library also has access to myriad [[computer file|electronic]] databases including JSTOR, ProQuest Direct, EBSCOHost, First Search, and others. Access is available to the university community via login both on and off campus.

===Peterson Hall===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Peterson Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Peterson Hall]]
Peterson Hall is the second-oldest building on campus and houses the School of Education as well as the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences. In the basement is a food lab, as well as a sewing lab. Each month, SPU's food lab plays host to a Community Kitchen - an outreach to the city's homeless population wherein these individuals join with members of the university community in cooking and sharing a common meal.

===Student Union Building===
The Student Union Building (commonly known as the "SUB") was built in the 1960s and still serves as a central point where many students gather. On the first floor is the Pacific Collegium, a hub for commuter students. Dining options provided by the on campus dining services can also be found in the SUB. UNICOM, a student-run information desk assists with ticket sales, bus passes, pool passes, among other general information items. ASSP, the student government of SPU has its offices in the SUB along with STUB, the student event programming organization.

===Philip W. and Sharon K. Eaton Hall===
SPU's main hard sciences facility houses biology, chemistry and some psychology labs. Built in 2003, it is the most advanced building on campus, complete with an electron microscope, cold room, fully contained greenhouse and LEED Certification. This building is central to those students in the Pre-Professional Health Sciences programs. SPU's pre-med track has become widely known for its annual 90–100% acceptance into medical schools following graduation. On May 23, 2012, the SPU Board of Trustees announced that it named the building in honor of past SPU president Philip W.Eaton and his wife, Sharon.

=== McKenna Hall ===
[[File:Seattle Pacific McKenna Hall.jpg|thumb|McKenna Hall]]
The School of Business, Government, and Economics (SBGE) is located in McKenna Hall. In addition to undergraduate degrees in Management, Accounting, Economics, Political Science, and Global Development Studies - SBGE also offers three graduate level degrees: Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Information Management, and a Master of Arts in Management. SBGE is home to the Center for Applied Learning and the Center for Integrity in Business which examines the intersections of theology and contemporary business.

===Residences===
Seattle Pacific University has five [[residence hall]]s. The university offers other on-campus [[House|residence]] options, such as the Cremona and Wesley apartments, and other small suite- or apartment-style living facilities for continuing students. All residence halls feature single-gender floors. The five residence halls are Ashton Hall, Hillsong Hall, Moyer Hall, Emerson Hall, and Arnett Hall.

Freshmen are required to live on campus in the residence halls unless they are living with family. Meal plans are required for all students living in the dorms. Students may leave campus housing when they are 20&amp;nbsp;years old, have junior class status, have petitioned and been approved to live off campus by Campus Housing, or are graduate students.
[[File:Seattle Pacific University 05A.jpg|thumb|SPU Main Gate]]
'''Arnett Hall''' welcomed its inaugural residents in Autumn 2014. As SPU's second smallest dorm with only four resident floors, it features suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, a main lounge on the first floor, and a green roof and roof deck on the fifth floor. Rooms on the upper floors may also feature views of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It is located in the northwest corner of campus, just across the street from Demaray Hall and just down the hillsong from Gwinn Commons, SPU's dining hall.

'''Ashton Hall''', opened in 1965, is SPU's largest [[residence hall]] with more than 400&amp;nbsp;students on 6&amp;nbsp;floors. It was named in honor of Philip F. Ashton, PhD, a psychology professor (1929–1971). The hall is located on the highest point of SPU's campus. Many rooms have views of the campus and the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]]. Annual Ashton Pop events include the Ashton Cup lip-sync contest, the Ashton Art Show, and a formal ball. In previous years the ball has been held at the [[Space Needle]], on an [[Argosy Cruise]], and at Seattle's [[W Hotel]]. Ashton Hall is also home to the Orangemen of 6th West (6w), a notable floor on campus, who display their school spirit by attending men's basketball home games and some away games, leading cheers for the Falcons and occasionally against the referees and the other team.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Emerson1.jpg|thumb|left|Emerson Hall]] --&gt;
'''Emerson Hall''', opened in 2001, is the campus's second newest residence hall, featuring suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, card-access security, a main [[living room|lounge]] with gas fireplace and Northwest wood beams, and an exercise center. Emerson also has a "Bridges Program", which lets students participate in intentional programs and conversations related to global issues and cross-cultural relationships. Emerson events include a quarterly Coffee House, the Emerson Film Festival, and the Spring Banquet. The hall is named for the street on which it resides.

'''Hill Hall''', which opened in 1962, located in the upper middle of the campus just steps from Gwinn Commons and the SPU Library, is known as the "family" hall for its comfortable atmosphere. It features a newly updated main lounge, the REX athletic center,  and the Hill Hall "beach", a grassy area behind the hall popular for [[outdoor]] [[recreation]] and sunbathing. Hill Hall events include "Decade" Skate (a song-based skit competition), a retreat to Camp Casey, an annual [[ball]], and 6th Hill "Beach Bash." It is named for the Reuben Hill family who donated property to the school for its expansion.

'''Moyer Hall''', opened in 1953 and remodeled in 1983, is located in the center of the campus on the edge of Tiffany Loop. The smallest of the traditional residence halls, Moyer was named in honor of Jacob Moyer, PhD, professor of chemistry and dean (1925–46). The hall's annual events include a fall retreat, an ice-broomball game, a citywide [[scavenger hunt]], and an all-hall [[banquet]].  In the past, the ice-broomball game was played between residents of Moyer and Marston Hall (no longer used for housing).  This annual "Toilet Bowl" match featured as its trophy a urinal removed from Moyer during the 1983 remodel, which the losing hall was required to display prominently the year following their loss.  The 05–06 school year also introduced a new event called The Experience Moyer Project (EMP), which featured musical talent from the hall as well as a variety of other activities.

The university owns multiple additional residences including Bailey, Cremona, 37 West Dravus, Falcon, Wesley and other buildings known by address rather than name are owned and maintained by SPU. These apartments are closer to campus but provide a more independent-living situation. They provide a great aggregate living environment among students. The 35 and 34 West Cremona apartments were remodeled in 2008–09 and 2009–10, respectively, and the Wesley Apartments at Cremona and Dravus, as of the 2011–2012 academic year, are now owned and operated by SPU and include the offices of two of the Residence Life Coordinators. The school sold the Robbins apartments in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">The '''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''' ('''SAHGB''') is a [[United Kingdom]] [[learned society]] for people interested in the [[history of architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/about.html About US], ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain The Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021321/http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain |date=2008-12-06 }}, [[RIBApedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/a/OL5265410A Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain], [[Open Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Society exists to encourage interest in the history of architecture, to enable the exchange and discussion of ideas related to this. The Society has no official location and its activities cover the [[United Kingdom]]. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.

''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' is the main journal of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members.

== History ==

The foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by [[Turpin Bannister]] in discussion with [[Frank Jenkins (architect)|Frank Jenkins]], a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the [[University of Illinois]] in the [[United States]]. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American [[Society of Architectural Historians]] partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the [[York Institute of Architectural Study]].

[[File:Strathcona Science Park.JPG|thumbnail|Park welcome sign]]

'''Strathcona Science Provincial Park ''' is a [[provincial park]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], located between [[Edmonton]] and [[Sherwood Park]], south of the [[Yellowhead Highway]] and west of [[Anthony Henday Drive]].

The park is situated in the [[North Saskatchewan River]] valley, on both banks of the river, at an elevation of {{cvt|625|m}} and has a surface of {{cvt|2.9|km2|sqmi}}. It was established on December&amp;nbsp;12, 1979 and is maintained by [[Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation]].

This site was for thousands of years the site of an annual aboriginal camp, as it was located close enough to the river for transportation and trade and the bluffs of the river valley provided excellent bison-hunting opportunities.  The park was established to preserve the site from encroaching industrial development.  It was the site of archeological excavations in 1978 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL2751267M/Strathcona_site_(FjPi-29)_excavations_1978_1979_and_1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The park contains several abandoned [[Interpretation centre|interpretive buildings]] opened by the Alberta government in 1980 but now shuttered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/once-celebrated-science-park-becomes-shuttered-casualty-in-alberta/article26866498/ "Once celebrated science park becomes shuttered casualty in Alberta"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Oct. 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Remnants of the park's history as a public science center include tiled triangular [[obelisk]]s, a [[boardwalk]] through the archaeological area, and a few interpretive plaques.  The area is safe but overgrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=River Valley Alliance| url=http://rivervalleypark.blogspot.com/2011/06/getting-out-in-river-valley.html| title= Getting Out in the River Valley |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goyette |first= Linda  |author2=Carolina Jakeway Roemmich  |title= Edmonton in Our Own Words |publisher= [[University of Alberta Press]] |page= 10 |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-88864-428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Five Orders of Architecture''''' (''Regola delle cinque ordini d'architettura'') is a book on classical architecture by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] from 1562, and is considered "one of the most successful architectural textbooks ever written",&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evers|first=Vernd|title=Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present |year=2003|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-1699-8|pages=845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5OK-Yw-A3cC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having no text apart from the notes and the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=The classical language of architecture|year=1963|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69012-6|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57aoJE26kQkC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Vignola+%22no+text%22+orders&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wn5TIeqFI2P4gap2qHnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22no%20text%22%20orders&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in Italian as ''Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura'', it has been fully or partially translated in English with different titles, including ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Vignola: an elementary treatise on architecture comprising the complete study of the five orders, with indication of their shadows and the first principles of construction''; ''The Five Orders of Architecture according to Giacomo Barozzio of Vignola, to Which are Added the Greek Orders''; and ''The five orders of architecture, the casting of shadows and the first principles of construction based on the system of Vignola''.

==Contents==
The book tackles the five orders, [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], Doric, [[Ionic order|Ionic]], Corinthian, and [[Composite order|Composite]] in separate sections, each subdivided in five parts on the [[colonnade]], [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]], arcade with [[pedestal]], individual pedestals, and [[entablature]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. Following those 25 sections were some less related parts on [[cornice]]s and other elements. Written during the 1550s, it was published in 1562, and was soon considered the most practical work for the application of the five orders. Apart from the introduction, the book existed solely of 32 annotated plates, with views from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] illustrating the [[Corinthian order]] and the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] for the [[Doric order]]. Later editions had more illustrations.

==Author==
Vignola was an Italian [[Renaissance]] architect who was the assistant of [[Michelangelo]] during his work on the [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. He was also one of the architects of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] and the [[Church of the Gesu]]. Following the examples of the Classical Roman work of [[Vitruvius]] and the five books of the ''Regole generali d'architettura'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]] from 1537 on, Vignola started writing an architecture rule book on the [[classical order]]s. His work was more practical than the preceding two books which were more philosophical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallgrave|first=Harry Francis|title=An Anthology from Vitruvius to 1870|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0258-2|pages=590|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxo8t5cZf6MC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions and translations==
It was over the next centuries often reprinted, translated, and used as an inspiration, e.g. for [[William Robert Ware]]'s main work ''The American Vignola'' from 1904. By 1700, it had been reprinted 15 times in Italian, and was translated in Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=William R.|title=The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture|year=1994|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28310-4|pages=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, more than 250 editions of the book had been published,&lt;ref name=Taschen/&gt; marking it as "the most widely used architectural textbook of all up to the nineteenth century [...] forming one of the universal bases of courses of architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruft|first=Hanno-Walter|title=A history of architectural theory: from Vitruvius to the present|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-010-2|pages=706|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPTfVyHyVW4C&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=Vignola+cinque&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YP_4TLpXiJWzBqXhobQD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20cinque&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Glasgow Looking Glass''''' was the first mass-produced publication to tell stories using illustrations, and as such is regarded as the earliest comics magazine.  The final issue was published on 3 April 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's first comic book from Glasgow in spotlight |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/world-s-first-comic-book-from-glasgow-in-spotlight-1-2974087 |first=Tristan |last=Stewart-Robertson |work=The Scotsman |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The title was published by Glasgow [[Lithography|lithographic]] printer John Watson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glasgow Looking Glass|url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/june2005.html|work=University of Glasgow|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal strip illustrator was [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]].  The fourth issue contained ''History of a Coat'', its first comic strip. After the fifth issue, the title was changed to ''The Northern Looking Glass'' to reflect broader Scottish concerns.

==Format==
The fortnightly publication provided satirical snapshots of Glasgow society, British culture and Nineteenth century fashions. Innovations included use of the term "[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]" and [[word balloons]].

The '''College of Information Studies''' (''Maryland's [[iSchool]]'') is a graduate school located at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in [[Maryland]], United States. The College offers graduate study leading to the [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS), the [[Master of Information Management]] (MIM), the Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction (HCIM), and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]. In addition, they offer the Bachelor of Science in Information Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci|title=Bachelor of Science in Information Science (InfoSci)|last=adi1710|date=2016-07-14|work=ISchool|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Information Studies focuses on creating new designs and addressing issues  involving Information Management.&lt;ref&gt;https://ischool.umd.edu/what-ischool&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The iSchool was founded in 1965 with Paul Wasserman as its first dean.  Wasserman, a former military man who was part of the [[Invasion of Normandy]], held the post for 5 years.  Wasserman was very supportive of research and the school became the first [[Information school]] to require a technology course.  Wasserman saw technology as a tool for information management.  Wasserman was a librarian, and his broad vision helped the program get on its feet.  He was constantly traveling and recruiting international faculty members and students.  Wasserman would later write an autobiography which is available at [[University of Maryland Libraries|McKeldin Library]].  The school's original name was the School of Library and Information Services and by 1972 it had established its location in Hornbake Library's South Wing.  The school attained full accreditation from the [[American Library Association]] (it has never lost its accreditation) in 1966 and the first PhD students were in 1967.

In 1991 the school had a [[#Crisis of 1991|major crisis]] as it was very close to being shut down.

In 1993 Ann Prentice became dean of the school.  During this time period the University of Maryland's Provost prompted a general review of the school and a reexamination of the goals and mission statement.  The Provost wanted to promote more innovation, creation, research and services.  Therefore, the school went through significant changes as the MLS curriculum was revised and the school started to morph into what it is now, an iSchool.  Bruce Dearstyne took over as Interim Dean in 2001, after Prentice retired, and the transformation continued under his leadership.  His signature initiative was introduction of the [[Master of Information Management]] program (MIM).  In 2005, [[Jenny Preece]] became Dean.  Under Preece, the MIM program has grown substantially.  In the 2007 school year the MIM program had its highest student body count at 149.  In addition, under Preece's directorship, a new master's program was added, Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction.

In the summer of 2015, Brian Butler took over as interim dean as [[Jenny Preece]] stepped down. [[Keith Marzullo]] is the new incoming dean from the summer of 2016.

==Challenges==
The iSchool has faced several challenges throughout its history.

===Crisis of 1991===
In the 1980s there was heated debate over whether Library Schools should be a part of major research-oriented universities.  The University of Chicago's Graduate Library School was closed in 1989 and its closing was attributed to "the divorce of the School's research activities from what the profession perceived as its needs for training."  Shortly thereafter, in 1990, Columbia University's School of Library Service was closed.  There were reports of fierce opposition from tenured faculty to sever ties to all library communities and reorient priorities to support newly emerging information communities as well as deemphasize professionally relevant education and practitioner connections.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Bill. Spanning the Theory-Practice Divide in Library &amp; Information Science. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;     In 1991, coupled with the economic downturn (the University had implemented furloughs as well) there was a call for the iSchool at Maryland to be shut down.  It was proposed that the school became a department rather than a self-standing college.  There was a public, open meeting where the issue was debated.  The school was given support by Representative [[Steny Hoyer]].  In addition, past deans, faculty and alumni were on hand to counter the proposal.  Former students spoke up in defense of the program, attributing their successes in public service jobs to the college's educational programs.  The school was able to avoid being shut down.

===Transition Phase===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), there was a period of transition within the iSchool.  There was a general realization that the field was changing and that the business model was changing.  With the advent of the Web and search engines there were changes in how information was being gathered and consumed.  There would be more of a demand for "Information Technology Professionals" rather than Librarians.  During this time, there was a lot of funding going to the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University and with the perceived growth of technology the lab was moved into the South wing of Hornbake Library where the iSchool was located.  This move caused some tension as the iSchool's teaching library was disbanded and in its place faculty offices and research facilities were set up to accommodate the growth of the school.  There was a fight to keep the iSchool's library - there were protests and petitions but none were fruitful and the library was removed from Hornbake.  There was a recognized opportunity to train professionals for the corporate world and so when Dearstyne took over he helped lead the school as it introduced the new MIM program.  Some faculty felt like the school was abandoning its "ontology" and abandoning libraries as an institution.  There wasn't necessarily resistance to the MIM but rather to a second master's program in general.  The question, "not will it be" but "what will it be" defined the debates.  Despite initial concerns, the school has seen a steady rise in acceptance and interest.  2007 was a record year for the MIM program in number of students (149).  In 2009 U.S. News &amp; World Report recognized Maryland’s iSchool as one of the top information schools in the country, ranking it 10th among all public universities &lt;ref name="US News and World Report Ranking"&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
As part of a major research university the iSchool has initiated and led many programs both internally and externally that have helped serve the community.

===Inside the iSchool===

====HCIL====
The [[University of Maryland Human – Computer Interaction Lab|Human Computer Interaction Lab]], located in the South wing of Hornbake, has had ties with the community for many years.

====The Information Policy and Access Center (iPAC)====
"The Information Policy and Research Center (iPAC) is a research and education facility that explores social, policy, and technology aspects of information access and use across cultural institutions, government agencies, and other information-based organizations; communities; and populations. Researchers at iPAC study what policies and/or technologies lead to equitable and inclusive information access, a digitally literate population, and an informed and engaged public."&lt;ref name="Centers &amp; Research Labs"&gt;[http://ischool.umd.edu/content/centers-research-labs Centers &amp; Research Labs.] College of Information Studies website. Retrieved 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information ([[CASCI]])====
[[CASCI]] is a multidisciplinary network of researchers interested in supporting learning, facilitating innovation, transforming science and scholarship, promoting economic development, and enhancing individual and civic well-being. This network focuses on the facilitation of research and education around technology, information, and organization approaches to help communities realize their potential.

==== The Digital Curation Innovation Center (DCIC) ====
The DCIC is a center focused on education and partnership for research and practice on big archival projects. Specialities include computational and digital archiving bringing together the public, government, and industry for scaled archiving.

==== Privacy Education &amp; Research Lab (PEARL) ====
Dr. Jessica Vitak leads PEARL, which focuses on studying and curating ways for people to manage and understanding their privacy and security in networked contexts including social networking websites and other online communities. Research areas include [[big data ethics]] and mobile privacy and surveillance.

==== Ethics and Values in Design Lab (EViD) ====
The EViD lab, led by Dr. Katie Shilton, focuses on the way that ethics and policy affect the design and use of technology. EViD is part of both CASCI and iPAC.

====Notable Faculty and Accomplishments====
*Dr. Diane Barlow helped develop a proposal in 1993 that awarded tuition to women who were part-time students.  6-8 students were chosen and their tuition remitted so they could complete the program.  The initiative was part of the school's goal to help provide monetary relief to students during bad economic times.
*Dr. Barlow and Dr. Prentice helped initiate a collaboration and exchange program with a Chinese Institution in [[Beijing]].
*Dr. Barlow helped expand the school's reach to [[Universities at Shady Grove|Shady Grove]] and now the school has extended its educational reach.
*During Prentice's deanship there was an increased demand for Library Media Specialists in the state of [[Maryland]].  [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] entered into an agreement with the school where tuition was taken care of for a certain number of students who entered the program.  In exchange these students committed to working for the county for a period of time.

===Outside the iSchool===

====Research Support====
There has been research support for the iSchool from [[National Science Foundation]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]].

====Kidsteam====
Children, ages 7–11, work with HCIL faculty/staff/students after school and over the summer to create new technologies for children.

==Curriculum==

=== Bachelor of Science in Information Science ===
Started in 2016, the undergraduate program in Information Science is one of the most recent additions to the undergraduate majors offered at the University of Maryland in College Park. Its goal is to educate students in an interdisciplinary curriculum with aspects from computer science, business, and psychology. In the iSchool, this bachelors program is meant to focus on how "information, people, and technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci|title=Bachelor of Science in Information Science (InfoSci)|last=adi1710|date=2016-07-14|work=ISchool|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" come together within the field of Information Science. Undergraduate students focused on this major will learn skills related to online website development essential to the work force. These skills include database design, web and mobile development, and data analytics. These students will also prepare for leadership and management roles while taking humanities classes and engaging in internships.  &lt;ref&gt;https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci&lt;/ref&gt;

===MLIS===
The Master of Library &amp; Information Science Program educates students in the knowledge, skills, habits of thought and inquiry, and ethics of the library and information professions to enable them to be leaders in the state, national, and global information society.
The program for the MLIS degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. In the non -thesis option, all credits are coursework. The thesis option requires 30 credits of coursework and six credits of thesis research. The usual and recommended course of study for a full-time student is approximately 18–24 months. The program offers three specializations and a few concentrations.

====Specializations====

=====Archives, Records and Information Management=====
The specialization meets all requirements recommended for archival education by the [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Maryland {{!}} SAA|url=http://www2.archivists.org/dae/university-of-maryland|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies|url=http://www2.archivists.org/standards/guidelines-for-a-graduate-program-in-archival-studies|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====School Library Media=====
The specialization accomplishes this mission by :
*Providing intellectual and physical access to materials in all formats.
*Providing instruction to foster competence and stimulate interest in reading, viewing and using information and ideas.
*Working with other educators to design learning strategies to meet the needs of individual students.
Students who complete this specialization earn the State of Maryland Library Media Specialist Certification, as the SLM specialization curriculum fulfills the requirements of the certificate (with the exception of 3 credits in learning theory and 3 credits in classroom techniques required of students who do not have a teaching backgrounds.)

=====Curation and Management of Digital Assets=====
The specialization, beginning in the fall of 2013, focuses on managing digital information and material.&lt;ref&gt;http://ischool.umd.edu/content/curation-and-management-digital-assets&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concentrations====

=====E-Government=====
Focuses on the nature, current impacts, and potential future impacts of e-government, also known as digital government or electronic government. E-government is the use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies by governments to provide information and services, as well as to use as channels of communication to citizens, businesses, and other governments.

=====Lifelong Access=====
Focuses on the information behavior of individuals as members of a defined group. Groups may be defined by age (i.e., young children, youth, adults, seniors); life activities (i.e., elementary students, undergraduates, parents, caregivers); job or profession (i.e., physicians, chemists, teachers, scholars); avocation or hobby (i.e., genealogist, sports coach, amateur chef); and numerous other attributes (i.e., newly arrived immigrants, consumers, medical patients).

=====Information and Diverse Populations=====
Focuses on instruction about and research into the design, development, provision and integration of information services, resources, technologies and outreach that serve diverse populations.

===MIM===
The MIM program trains information technology professionals who know how to strategically manage information and technology and who understand the issues of information management, business management, computer science, and information systems.  The MIM degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. A unique component of the MIM program is the pair of project courses taken at the end of the coursework. One of the courses involves a team project focused on solving an actual information management project at a real-world organization, and the other is an individual project. Each of these courses carry three credits, and require about 120 hours of work per student over a regular semester of three months.

====Tracks====

=====Strategic Management of Information=====
The Strategic Management of Information Concentration is intended for those students who want to follow the “CIO” (Chief Information Officer) or general management path. This concentration is designed for professionals who require a strong understanding of the role of information and technology in the management and operation of the organization, but who are not directly involved in the actual development of applications or systems. This track reflects the original, single-track structure of the MIM program as it was introduced in August 2003. The other two tracks were added to the program in January 2007.

=====Socio-Tech Information Systems=====
The Socio-Tech Information Systems Concentration is intended for those students who want to follow the “CTO” (Chief Technology Officer) or director of technology development path. This concentration is designed for professionals who require a basic understanding of management issues and who are actively involved in the actual development of applications or systems.

=====Individual Program Plan=====
The Individual Program Plan is intended for those students who want to follow the “internal advancement” path as information professionals. It provides a foundation of general knowledge in Information Management and Technology, with the ability for customization for their particular circumstances, in order to advance within their current profession and organization.

===HCIM===
The Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction degree integrates information studies, computer science, education, psychology and engineering to prepare HCI leaders of the future.  Through coursework and research experiences, students in this program will develop skills in:
*Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction
*Advanced research methods
*Usability analysis and testing
*Social computing strategies and technologies
*Technology design

===Doctoral Program===
Students must complete a minimum of 25 graduate credit hours while matriculated at the University of Maryland (or 28 hours if basic statistics is taken as a graduate course). Course-work will be taken in three areas of study which include: Information Studies (6 credit hours); Research Methods and Design (10 credit hours) and specialized area(s) (9 credit hours).
All students have a First Year Review the first full academic year that a student takes his/her first doctoral seminar. Students prepare a portfolio that self-evaluates progress. This may include papers written for coursework or research, a presentation on a research topic and/or reviews by previous course instructors. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, will review the work and inform the student in writing of the results.

Students do not take comprehensive exams, but instead write an Integrative Paper that synthesizes and applies knowledge from broad areas of the information field. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, approves the topic and abstract of the paper, and certifies its successful completion. The paper will typically be written after completion of coursework or equivalent experience (e.g., extensive work in a research environment) and must be completed and approved before advancement to candidacy.

Students are required to successfully defend a dissertation to complete the program.

'''''Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering religion and science published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. It was established in 1966 and the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Willem B. Drees]] ([[Leiden University]]). ''Zygon'' is sponsored by the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]] and the [[Center for Advanced Study in Religion and Science]].

The name "Zygon" (mod. L., ad. ζυγόν Gr. yoke.), according to the journal founder [[Ralph Wendell Burhoe]], is the Greek term for anything which joins two bodies, especially the yoking or harnessing of a team which must pull together effectively. The Zygon is the symbol of the journal, its aim being to reunite the "split team" of values and knowledge.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
