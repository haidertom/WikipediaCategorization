The '''Accession Day tilts''' were a series of elaborate festivities held annually at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]] to celebrate her [[Accession Day]], 17&amp;nbsp;November, also known as Queen's Day.&lt;ref&gt;which was elevated into a [[Protestant]] [[feast day]] by adding it to the [[Anglican]] [[Church calendar]]: "All over England the Queen's subjects expressed their joy in her Government by prayers and sermons, bell-ringing, bonfires and feasting", notes Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86-103) p 87; see also, whereon sttod a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters Strong (1984):19 and Hutton 1994:146-151&lt;/ref&gt;  The tilts combined [[theatre|theatrical]] elements with [[jousting]], in which Elizabeth's [[courtier]]s competed to outdo each other in [[allegory|allegorical]] [[armour]] and [[costume]], [[poetry]], and [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry to exalt the queen and her realm of [[England]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; the queen died the following spring.  Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of [[James I of England|James I]], 24&amp;nbsp;March, until 1624, the year before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1987):137-138; Young, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Henryleegarniture.jpg|thumb|left|The Greenwich garniture of [[Sir Henry Lee]], in the Jacob Album]]
Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], [[Queen's Champion]], devised the Accession Day tilts, which became the most important [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] court festival from the 1580s.&lt;ref&gt;Festivities surrounding installations of the [[Order of the Garter]] were less frequent, less elaborate and less public.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations are likely to have begun somewhat informally in the early 1570s.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; By 1581, the Queen's Day tilts "had been deliberately developed into a gigantic public spectacle eclipsing every other form of court festival", with thousands in attendance; the public were admitted for a small charge.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 133, &amp; 1984:51&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee himself oversaw the annual festivities until he retired as Queen's Champion at the tilt of 1590, handing over the role to [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial transfer is described in detail in Yates, p. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Lee's retirement, orchestration of the tilts fell to the [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]] in his capacity of [[Master of Horse]] and to the queen's [[favourite]], the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], although Lee remained as a sort of Master of Ceremonies at the request of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The pageants were held at the [[tiltyard]] at the [[Palace of Whitehall]],&lt;ref&gt;except in 1593, when they were relocated to the grounds of [[Windsor Castle]] due to an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in [[London]]; see Young, p. 122, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; where the royal party viewed the festivities from the Tiltyard Gallery.  The [[Office of Works]] constructed a platform with staircases below the gallery to facilitate presentations to the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
[[Image:Devereaux essex4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] in "sable sad" armour, probably for the Tilt of 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Young p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; by [[William Segar]].]]

===Knights===
Tilt lists for the Accession Day pageants have survived; these establish that the majority of the participating jousters came from the ranks of the Queen's [[Gentlemen Pensioners]].  Entrants included such powerful members of the court as the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], Lord [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Howard of Effingham]],&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; and the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating had seen active service in Ireland or on the Continent, but the atmosphere of romance and entertainment seems to have predominated over the serious military exercises that were medieval tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1984):51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir James Scudamore]], a knight who tilted in the 1595 tournament, was immortalized as "Sir Scudamour" in Book Four of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]].
[[File:Scudamorehelmet.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[Sir James Scudamore]], 1590s. Jousting was crucial to Scudamore's reputation at court.&lt;ref&gt;The armet shown was made by restorer Daniel Tachaux in 1915 to replace the missing original, and faithfully reproduces the style's distinctive high visor.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Knights participating in the spectacle entered in pageant cars or on horseback, disguised as some heroic, romantic, or [[metaphor]]ical figure, with their servants in [[fancy dress]] according to the theme of the entry.  A squire presented a [[Card stock|pasteboard]] pageant shield decorated with the character's [[Personal device|device]] or ''impresa'' to the Queen and explained the significance of his disguise in prose or poetry.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants went to considerable expense to devise themes, order armour and costumes for their followers, and in some cases to hire poets or dramatists and even professional actors to carry out their programmes.  

Classical, [[pastoral]], and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] settings were typically combined with story lines flattering to the queen, but serious subtexts were common, especially among those who used these occasions to express public contrition or desolation for having aroused the queen's displeasure, or to plead for royal favour.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 167-77&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting on the left, Essex wears black (sable) armour, which he wore as part of his 1590 entrance to the tilts.  At this particular tilt, Essex entered as the head of a funeral procession, carried on a bier by his attendants.  This was meant to atone for his failure to subdue Ireland, but Elizabeth was not impressed and did not forgive him readily.

===Poets===
Poets associated with court circles who wrote allegorical verses to accompany the knights' presentations include [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], [[Edward de Vere]], [[Philip Sidney]]&lt;ref&gt;'Two Songs for an Accession Day Tilt', in ''Sir Philip Sidney: The Major Works'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young [[Francis Bacon]], who composed speeches and helped stage presentations for his [[patron]], the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;'A Conference of Pleasure' (speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'In Praise of Knowledge', 'In Praise of Fortitude', 'In Praise of Love', 'In Praise of Truth'; 'The Device of the Indian Prince' (Speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'Squire', 'Hermit', 'Soldier', 'Statesman'.   [http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html Dates of Francis Bacon's works, retrieved 29 November 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011022037/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}; and see Strong (1987), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney, in particular, as both poet and knight, embodied the [[chivalry|chivalric]] themes of the tilts; a remembrance of Sidney was part of the tilt programme of 1586, the year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney's friend and protégé [[Sir James Scudamore]], who would go on to be one of the primary competitors in the Accession Day tilt in 1595, carried the pennant of Sidney's arms at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Atherton, Ian. Ambition and Failure in Stuart England: The Career of John, First Viscount Scudamore, Manchester University Press, 1999. p.34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', which turns upon the Accession Day festivities as its fundamental structural device: "I devise that the Faery Queen kept her Annuall feast xii. days, upon which xii. severall days, the occasions of the xii. severall adventures hapned&lt;!--hapned in original--&gt;, which being undertaken by xii. severall knights, are in these xii. books severally handled and discoursed";&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spenser to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] quoted in Roy C. Strong 1958:86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A visitor's account==
[[File:Armor Garniture of George Clifford (1558–1605), Third Earl of Cumberland MET DP295743.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] (1558–1605), 1586.  This has a different design to that in the miniature by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] (at top).]]
The fullest straightforward account of a Tilt is by Lupold von Wedel, a German traveller who saw the 1584 celebrations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now approached the day, when on November 17 the tournament was to be held... About twelve o’clock the queen and her ladies placed themselves at the windows in a long room at Weithol [Whitehall] palace, near Westminster, opposite the barrier where the tournament was to be held. From this room a broad staircase led downwards, and round the barrier stands were arranged by boards above the ground, so that everybody by paying 12d. would get a stand and see the play... Many thousand spectators, men, women and girls, got places, not to speak of those who were within the barrier and paid nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the whole time of the tournament all those who wished to fight entered the list by pairs, the trumpets being blown at the time and other musical instruments. The combatants had their servants clad in different colours, they, however, did not enter the barrier, but arranged themselves on both sides. Some of the servants were disguised like savages, or like Irishmen, with the hair hanging down to the girdle like women, others had horses equipped like elephants, some carriages were drawn by men, others appeared to move by themselves; altogether the carriages were very odd in appearance. Some gentlemen had their horses with them and mounted in full armour directly from the carriage. There were some who showed very good horsemanship and were also in fine attire. The manner of the combat each had settled before entering the lists. The costs amounted to several thousand pounds each.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a gentleman with his servants approached the barrier, on horseback or in a carriage, he stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the queen’s room, while one of his servants in pompous attire of a special pattern mounted the steps and addressed the queen in well-composed verses or with a ludicrous speech, making her and her ladies laugh. When the speech was ended he in the name of his lord offered to the queen a costly present.. .Now always two by two rode against each other, breaking lances across the beam.. . The fête lasted until five o’clock in the afternoon...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp SHAFE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170842/http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp |date=December 3, 2008 }} Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, New Series IX (1895)pp. 258-9, quoted Strong, 1984, Yates ''Astrea'' etc&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bar indicates 1 cm. Electrophoresis performed overnight at less than 10&amp;nbsp;V/cm. The analysis was performed early in the 1970s at the Protein Laboratory]]

'''Affinity electrophoresis''' is a general name for many analytical methods used in [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]]. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so-called [[electrophoretic mobility shift assay]], charge shift electrophoresis and affinity [[capillary electrophoresis]]. The methods are based on changes in the [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] pattern of molecules (mainly [[macromolecules]]) through biospecific interaction or [[complex formation]]. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged [[detergent]]. [[Nucleic acid]]s or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods have been used for estimation of [[binding constant]]s, as for instance in [[lectin]] affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like [[glycan]] content or [[ligand]] binding. For enzymes and other ligand-binding proteins, one-dimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to [[immunoelectrophoresis|"rocket immunoelectrophoresis"]], affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to [[affinity chromatography]] by use of immobilized [[ligands]].

== Types and methods ==
Currently, there is ongoing research in developing new ways of utilizing the knowledge already associated with affinity electrophoresis to improve its functionality and speed, as well as attempts to improve already established methods and tailor them towards performing specific tasks.

=== Agarose gel electrophoresis ===
[[File:Figure displaying gel electrophoresis.png|thumb|an example of an agarose gel after electrophoresis]]
A type of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (AMSA), agarose gel electrophoresis is used to separate protein-bound amino acid complexes from free amino acids. Using a low voltage (~10&amp;nbsp;V/cm) to minimize the risk for heat damage, electricity is run across an agarose gel.

=== Rapid agarose gel electrophoresis ===
This technique utilizes a high voltage ({{nowrap|≥ 20 V/cm}}) with a 0.5× Tris-borate buffer run across an agarose gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rapid agarose gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay for quantitating protein: RNA interactions
|vauthors=Ream JA, Lewis LK, Lewis KA|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=511|date=October 2016|pp=36–41|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2016.07.027|pmid=27495142|pmc=5002362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method differs from the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis by utilizing a higher voltage to facilitate a shorter run time as well as yield a higher band resolution. Other factors included in developing the technique of rapid agarose gel electrophoresis are gel thickness, and the percentage of agarose within the gel.

=== Boronate affinity electrophoresis ===
Boronate affinity electrophoresis utilizes boronic acid infused acrylimide gels to purify NAD-RNA. This purification allows for researchers to easily measure the kinetic activity of NAD-RNA decapping enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Boronate affinity electrophoresis for the purification and analysis of cofactor-modified RNA|journal=Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity capillary electrophoresis ===
Affinity capillary electrophoresis utilizes a formulary approach in accordance with the theory of electromigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis: the theory of electromigration|vauthors=Dubský P, Dvořák M, Ansorge M|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume=408|issue=30|pp=8623–8641|pmid=27558099|doi=10.1007/s00216-016-9799-y|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method utilizes the inter-molecular interactions found in a free solution. "Affinity probes" consisting of fluorophore-labeled molecules that will bind to target molecules are mixed with the sample being tested. This mixture and its subsequent complexes are then separated through capillary electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=Oier|last2=Sastre Torano|first2=Javier|last3=Pukin|first3=Aliaksei|last4=Fu|first4=Ou|last5=Boons|first5=Geert Jan|last6=de Jong|first6=Gerhardus J.|last7=Pieters|first7=Roland J.|title=Affinity capillary electrophoresis for the assessment of binding affinity of carbohydrate-based cholera toxin inhibitors|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elps.201700207/abstract|journal=Electrophoresis|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/elps.201700207|issn=1522-2683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle behind this type of electrophoresis is the mobility of the target molecules being altered by inter-molecular interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinoshita|first=Eiji|last2=Kinoshita-Kikuta|first2=Emiko|last3=Koike|first3=Tohru|date=2015-03-18|title=The Cutting Edge of Affinity Electrophoresis Technology|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7382/3/1/42|journal=Proteomes|volume=3|issue=1|pages=42–55|doi=10.3390/proteomes3010042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ===
Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has become one of the most popular methods of protein separation. This is not only due to its separation qualities, but also because it can be used in conjunction with a variety of other analytic methods, such as mass spectrometry, and western blotting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method utilizes a two-step approach. First, a protein sample is run through a polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis. Then, the sample is transferred to a different polyacrylamide gel (the affinity-trap gel) where affinity probes are immobilized. The proteins that do not have affinity for the affinity probes pass through the affinity-trap gel, and proteins with affinity for the probes will be "trapped" by the immobile affinity probes. These trapped proteins are then visualized and identified using mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phosphate affinity electrophoresis ===
Phosphate affinity electrophoresis utilizes an affinity probe which consists of a molecule that binds specifically to divalent phosphate ions in neutral aqueous solution, known as a "Phos-Tag". This methods also utilizes a separation gel made of an acrylamide-pendent Phos-Tag monomer that is copolymerized. Phosphorylated proteins migrate slowly in the gel compared to non-phosphorylated proteins. This technique gives the researcher the ability to observe the differences in the phosphorylation states of any given protein.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Afforestation''' is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees ([[forestation]]) in an area where there was no previous tree cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/afforestation |title=SAFnet Dictionary &amp;#124; Definition For [afforestation&amp;#93; |publisher=Dictionaryofforestry.org |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2012-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232003/http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/afforestation |archivedate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government and non-governmental organizations directly engage in programs of afforestation to create forests, increase [[carbon capture]] and [[carbon sequestration]], and help to anthropogenically improve [[biodiversity]]. In the UK, afforestation may mean converting the legal status of some land to [[royal forest]].

{{see|Gap dynamics}}
Gap dynamics is the pattern of plant growth that occurs following the creation of a forest gap, a local area of natural disturbance that results in an opening in the canopy of a forest. Gap dynamics are a typical characteristic of temperate and tropical forests, and have a wide variety of causes and effects on forest life.

Sometimes special tools, such as a [[tree planting bar]], are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==In areas of degraded soil==
In some places, forests need help to reestablish themselves because of [[natural environment|environmental]] factors.  For a example, in arid zones, once [[forest cover]] is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees .  Other factors include [[overgrazing]] by [[livestock]], especially animals such as [[goat]]s, [[cow]]s, and [[over-harvesting]] of forest resources. Together these may lead to [[desertification]] and the loss of [[topsoil]]; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if [[erosion]] allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a [[duricrust]] or [[duripan]] that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth.  In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.

== Forests to attract rain ==
Several new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen,
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why deforestation in this region is linked with reduced rainfall &lt;ref&gt;Carol Rasmussen (2017), New study shows the Amazon makes its own rainy season, 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
 https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2608/new-study-shows-the-amazon-makes-its-own-rainy-season/&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesis suggests that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized. It explains how forested regions generate large-scale flows in atmospheric water vapor&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Sheil Daniel Murdiyarso
BioScience, Volume 59, Issue 4, 1 April 2009, Pages 341–347,https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12&lt;/ref&gt; Makarieva and Gorshkov have developed a hypothesis to explain how forests attract moist air and increase rainfall in area covered by trees &lt;ref&gt;Makarieva AM, Gorshkov VG, 2007, [[Biotic pump]] of atmospheric moisture as driver of the hydrological cycle on land, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 11: 1013–1033&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries and regions==
===Australia===
In [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] (a city of 1.3 million as of June 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Media%20Release12016?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3218.0&amp;issue=2016&amp;num=&amp;view=|title=Ten years of growth: Australia's population hot spots|publisher=Australian Bureau|accessdate=29 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930073403/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3218.0Media%20Release12016?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3218.0&amp;issue=2016&amp;num=&amp;view=|archive-date=2017-09-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Mike Rann]] (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area.  The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliontrees.com.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924184135/http://www.milliontrees.com.au/ |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
There is extensive and ongoing [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|Amazon deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[E. O. Wilson]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}). There is also ongoing afforestation effort in Brazil. In an afforestation hotspot outlined in Para, Brazil, 1 billion trees are intended to be planted to restore deforested lands by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Afforestation in Para, Brazil|url=http://lcluc.umd.edu/hotspot/afforestation-para-brazil-0|website=NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burkina Faso===
Desertification is increasing along the [[Sahel]], the strip of land between Africa's fertile tropics and the [[Sahara Desert]]. After a crippling famine in the 1970s caused by overgrazing and deforestation, a local community approach has been pioneered by Yacouba Sawadogo, a peasant farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1080 Films - The Man Who Stopped The Desert|url = http://www.1080films.co.uk/Yacoubamovie/synopsis.htm|website = www.1080films.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04|first = Paula|last = Wildash}}&lt;/ref&gt; By replanting trees and crops together in holes filled with compost, whole villages have been able to move back to areas considered uninhabitable.

===China===
[[File:Jiayu County - Panjiawan - on the Yangtze embankment - P1540267.JPG|thumb|Strips of forest are planted along hundreds of kilometers of the [[Yangtze]] [[levee]]s in [[Hubei]] province&lt;ref&gt;[http://slt.hubei.gov.cn/dfj/info.aspx?ArtID=2797 省河道堤防建设管理局2016年工作要点] (The work goals of the provincial waterway flood protection levee administration for 2016), 2016-02-17&lt;/ref&gt;]]
China has deforested most of its historically wooded areas. China reached the point where timber yields declined far below historic levels, due to over-harvesting of trees beyond [[sustainable]] yield.&lt;ref&gt;G.A.McBeath, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has set official goals for reforestation, these goals are set over an 80-year time horizon and have not been significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems by projects like the [[Green Wall of China]], which aims to replant a great deal of forests and halt the expansion of the [[Gobi desert]]. The Green Wall of China Project has historical precedences dating back to before the Common Era. However, in pre-modern periods, government sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|date=2018|title=FRONTIER, FORTIFICATION, AND FORESTATION: DEFENSIVE WOODLAND ON THE SONG–LIAO BORDER IN THE LONG ELEVENTH CENTURY|url=https://www.academia.edu/37471839/_Frontier_Fortification_and_Forestation_Defensive_Woodland_on_the_Song-Liao_Border_in_the_Long_Eleventh_Century_Journal_of_Chinese_History_2.2_2018_313-334|journal=Journal of Chinese History|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=313–334|doi=10.1017/jch.2018.7|issn=2059-1632|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. As a result, China has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 47,000 square kilometers of afforestation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/09/content_10631987.htm |title=China to plant more trees in 2009_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the forest area per capita is still far lower than the international average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6371092.html |title=51.54 billion trees planted by ordinary Chinese in 27 years - People's Daily Online |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been considerable criticism regarding the effectiveness of planting so many trees especially in regions where they never grew prior. Studies reveal that the water table of those areas is becoming deeper indicating significant water loss.

===Europe===
Europe has deforested the majority of its historical forests. The [[European Union]] (EU) has paid farmers for afforestation since 1990, offering grants to turn [[Agricultural land|farmland]] back into forest and payments for the management of forest. Between 1993 and 1997, EU afforestation policies made possible the re-forestation of over 5,000 square kilometres of land. A second program, running between 2000 and 2006, afforested more than 1000 square kilometres of land (precise statistics not yet available). A third such program began in 2007. Europe's forests are growing by 0.8 million ha a year thanks to these programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Wood_Forest growth|url = http://www.europeanwood.org.cn/en/forest-growth|website = www.europeanwood.org.cn|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], the National Program of Afforestation was introduced by the government after [[World War II]], when  area of forests shrank to 20% of country's territory. Consequently, forested areas of Poland grew year by year, and on December 31, 2006, forests covered 29% of the country (see: [[Polish forests]]). It is planned that by 2050, forests will cover 33% of Poland.

According to [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] statistics, [[Spain]] had the third fastest afforestation rate in Europe in the 1990-2005 period, after Iceland and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/the_world/most_re_forested_countries.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709051455/http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/the_world/most_re_forested_countries.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-07-09 |title=FAO Data |publisher=Blatantworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/spain.html |title=Mongabay.com: Deforestation tables and charts for Spain |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those years, a total of 44,360 square kilometers were afforested, and the total forest cover rose from 13,5 to 17,9 million hectares. In 1990, forests covered 26.6% of the Spanish territory. As of 2007, that figure had risen to 36.6%. Spain today has the fifth largest forest area in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/forestarea.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 the [[UK government]] set a target of 12% woodland cover in [[England]] by 2060, up from the then 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Forestry and Woodlands|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181809/pb13871-forestry-policy-statement.pdf.pdf|publisher=Defra|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Government-backed initiatives such as the [[Woodland Carbon Code]] are intended to support this objective by encouraging corporations and landowners to create new woodland to offset their carbon emissions.

Alpine and Subalpine regions have undergone a lot of deforestation and then forestation in the last 300 years. Out of this has emerged much practical experience. One example is the clustered group,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waldwissen.net/waldwirtschaft/waldbau/bergwald/wsl_rottenaufforstung/index_DE&lt;/ref&gt; which is a method to bring in stable age mixed tree communities.

===Hong Kong===
Since the founding of the crown colony in the 19th century, afforestation has taken place to prevent soil erosion in the catchment areas of the [[list of reservoirs in Hong Kong|reservoir]]s that were built. During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in the Second World War, the countryside was deforested as the remaining population required fuel to survive. Most of the trees were cut down and extensive reafforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native species, such as: [[Pinus massoniana]], [[Acacia confusa]] (Formosan acacia), [[Lophostemon confertus]] and the [[Melaleuca quinquenervia|Paper Bark Tree]].

===India===
[[File:Marebilli forest.jpg|thumb|Afforestation in South India]]
India has witnessed a minor increase in the percentage of the land area under forest cover from 1950 to 2006. In 1950 around 40.48 million hectares was covered by forest. In 1980 it increased to 67.47 million hectares and in 2006 it was found to be 69 million hectares. 23% of India is covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India: Environmental Profile|url = http://rainforests.mongabay.com/20india.htm|website = rainforests.mongabay.com|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of India are grouped into 5 major categories and 16 types based on biophysical criteria. 38% of the forest is categorized as subtropical dry deciduous and 30% as tropical moist deciduous and other smaller groups. Only local species are planted in an area. Trees bearing fruits are preferred wherever possible due to their function as a food source.

===Iran===
Iran is considered a low forest cover region of the world with present cover approximating seven percent of the land area. This is a value reduced by an estimated six million hectares of virgin forest, which includes [[oak]], [[almond]] and [[pistachio]].&lt;ref name="Stanturf"&gt;J.A.Stanturf, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to soil substrates, it is difficult to achieve afforestation on a large scale compared to other temperate areas endowed with more fertile and less rocky and arid soil conditions.&lt;ref name="Stanturf"/&gt;  Consequently, most of the afforestation is conducted with non-native species,&lt;ref name="Stanturf"/&gt; leading to [[habitat destruction]] for native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and resulting in an accelerated [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

Since 1996, with the preparation and testing of areas suitable for afforestation in the highlands of northern Tehran, the plan of flooding began with the name of the Southern Alborz Range forestry plan, which will cover approximately 2700 hectares of afforestation by 2017.By 2020, more than 2000 hectares will be added to the plan.(Amiri)

Tree-planting is an ancient [[Jewish]] tradition, mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as being more important than greeting the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =President of German States Council of Education Ministers Plants Tree at Kennedy Memorial | newspaper =Jerusalem Post | department =JPost.com: Green Israel: People And The Environment | publisher =The Jerusalem Post | date =July 29, 2009 | url =http://www.jpost.com/Green-Israel/People-and-The-Environment/President-of-German-States-Council-of-Education-Ministers-Plants-Tree-at-Kennedy-Memorial | accessdate = December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 240 million planted trees, [[Israel]] is one of only two countries that entered the 21st century with a net gain in the number of trees, due to massive afforestation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Forestry &amp; Ecology|url=http://www.jnf.org/work-we-do/our-projects/forestry-ecology/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207064210/http://www.jnf.org/work-we-do/our-projects/forestry-ecology/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 February 2009|publisher=[[Jewish National Fund]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt; Most Israeli forests are the product of a major afforestation campaign by the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Critics argue that many JNF lands inside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Leon."The Jewish National Fund: How the Land Was ‘Redeemed’: The JNF's historical concept of exclusively Jewish land is wholly anachronistic"; Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol 12 No. 4 &amp; Vol 13 No. 1, 05/06&lt;/ref&gt; Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Ephraim Cohen. "The Politics of Planting"; University of Chicago 1993 p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Susan (2005). The Other Side of Israel: My Journey Across the Jewish/Arab Divide. New York: Nan A. Talese. pp. 130–131. {{ISBN|978-0-385-51456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the JNF has provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city of [[Rawabi]], north of Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704107104574571491401847518 |title=Building Peace Without Obama's Interference |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa===
In North Africa, the [[Sahara Forest Project]] coupled with the [[Seawater greenhouse]] has been proposed. Some projects have also been launched in countries as [[Senegal]] to revert desertification. As of 2010, African leaders are discussing the combining of national resources to increase effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718235403/http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/06/17/african-leaders-discuss-great-green-wall-project-in-chadian-capital/ |archivedate=2010-07-18 |title=Combining of green walls |publisher=Afriqueavenir.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other projects as the [[Keita Integrated Development Project|Keita Project]] in Niger have been launched in the past, and have been able to locally revert damage done by [[desertification]]. See [[Development aid#Effectiveness]]

===United States===
The United States is roughly one-third covered in forest and woodland.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Nevertheless, areas in the US were subject to significant tree planting. In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains – land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. [[Arbor Day]] was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton]] in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the [[Dust Bowl]] environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of [[windbreak]]s stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]]).

At their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments – states, regions and provinces – unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions.  The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]], California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Scottish First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].  At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theclimategroup.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural [[grassland]] and [[savanna]] biomes, as the ideal would be the [[reforestation]] of areas where forest occurs naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Veldman, J.W., Overbeck, G.E., Negreiros, D., Mahy, G., Le Stradic, S., Durigan, G., Buisson, E., Putz, F.E. &amp; Bond, W.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Anthrobotics''' is the science of developing and studying [[robot]]s that are either entirely or in some way human-like.

The term ''anthrobotics'' was originally coined by Mark Rosheim in a paper entitled "Design of An Omnidirectional Arm" presented at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] International Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 13–18, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;2162–2167. Rosheim says he derived the term from "...[[Anthropomorphic]] and [[Robotics]] to distinguish the new generation of dexterous robots from its simple industrial robot forebears." The word gained wider recognition as a result of its use in the title of Rosheim's subsequent book ''Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics'', which focussed on facsimiles of human physical and psychological skills and attributes.

However, a wider definition of the term ''anthrobotics'' has been proposed, in which the meaning is derived from ''[[anthropology]]'' rather than ''anthropomorphic''. This usage includes robots that respond to input in a human-like fashion, rather than simply mimicking human actions, thus theoretically being able to respond more flexibly or to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This expanded definition also encompasses robots that are situated in social environments with the ability to respond to those environments appropriately, such as [[insect]] robots, robotic [[pet]]s, and the like.

Anthrobotics is now taught at some [[university|universities]], encouraging students not only to design and build robots for environments beyond current industrial applications, but also to speculate on the future of robotics that are embedded in the world at large, as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s are today. In 2016 philosopher [[Luis de Miranda]] created the Anthrobotics Cluster at the [[University of Edinburgh]] "a platform of cross-disciplinary research that seeks to investigate some of the biggest questions that will need to be answered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurism.com/anthrobotics-where-the-human-ends-and-the-robot-begins/ |title=Anthrobotics: Where The Human Ends and the Robot Begins |publisher=Futurism |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the relationship between humans, robots and intelligent systems and "a think tank on the social spread of robotics, and also how automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/unity-between-human-and-social-machines-what-if-we-humans-were-anthrobots/ |title=Unity Between Human &amp; Social Machines: What If We Humans Were Anthrobots? |publisher=Robohub |date= |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and automated protocols.

The '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute''', or '''AARI''' ({{lang-ru|Арктический и антарктический научно-исследовательский институт}}, abbreviated as '''ААНИИ''') is the oldest and largest [[Russia]]n research institute in the field of comprehensive studies of [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

The AARI has numerous departments, such as those of [[oceanography]], [[glaciology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] or Arctic river mouths and water resources, [[geophysics]], polar geography, and others. It also has its own computer center, ice research laboratory, experimental workshops, and a museum (the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]]). 

Scientists, such as [[Alexander Karpinsky]], [[Alexander Fersman]], [[Yuly Shokalsky]], [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich|Nikolai Knipovich]], [[Lev Berg]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Rudolf Samoylovich]], [[Professor Vize|Vladimir Vize]], [[Nikolai Zubov]], [[Pyotr Shirshov]], [[Nikolai Urvantsev]], and [[Yakov Gakkel]] have all made their valuable contributions to the work of the AARI.

Throughout its history, the AARI has organized more than a thousand Arctic expeditions, including dozens of high-latitude aerial expeditions, which transported 34(?) manned [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]]s ''Severniy Polyus'' ("Северный полюс", or North Pole) to Central Arctic. 
==History==
The AARI was founded on 3 March 1920 as the '''Northern Research and Trade Expedition''' (Северная научно-промысловая экспедиция) under the Scientific and Technical Department of the [[Vesenkha|All-Union Council of State Economy]]. In 1925, the expedition was reorganized into the '''Institute of Northern Studies''' (Институт по изучению Севера) and five years later - into the '''All-Union Arctic Institute''' (Всесоюзный арктический институт). In 1932, the institute was integrated into the [[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]] (Главное управление Северного морского пути). In 1948 the Arctic Geology Research Institute (Научно-исследовательский институт геологии Арктики, or НИИГА) was established on the basis of the [[geology]] department of the All-Union Arctic Institute, which would subordinate to the [[Ministry of Geology of the USSR]]. 

In 1955, the AARI participated in the organization of Antarctic research. In 1958, it began to organize and lead all of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, which would later make many geographic discoveries, and in the same year the [[All-Union]] Arctic Institute was renamed '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute'''. In 1963, the AARI was incorporated into the [[Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|Chief Administration of the Hydrometeorological Service]] (Главное управление Гидрометеослужбы) under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] (now [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia]]).

In 1967, AARI was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. In 1968, the institute engaged in research of the areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] contiguous to the Arctic and Antarctica.

[[File:Mars-human-exploration-art-astronauts-vehicle-dust-full.jpg|thumb|This space art, titled ''The Next Stop'' was selected by the ESA when discussing its Aurora program.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Liftoff_for_Aurora_Europe_s_first_steps_to_Mars_the_Moon_and_beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Aurora programme''' (sometimes called '''Aurora Exploration Programme''', or simply '''Exploration Programme''') is a [[human spaceflight]] [[List of human spaceflight programs|programme]] of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) established in 2001. The objective is to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for [[Space exploration|exploration]] of the [[Solar System]] using [[robotic spacecraft]] and [[human spaceflight]] to investigate bodies holding promise for traces of [[Astrobiology|life beyond the Earth]].&lt;ref name='Overview'&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora| title = The European Space Exploration Programme Aurora | publisher = [[ESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/exploration/moon-to-mars/assessing-aurora/ |title=Assessing Aurora |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=April 7, 2007 |accessdate=2015-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Member states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year periods, after which they can change their level of participation or pull out entirely. In the early years the Aurora programme planned for flagship missions and arrow missions for key technology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars aerocapture demonstrator. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the [[ExoMars]] mission and preparations for an international [[Mars sample return mission]].&lt;ref name='Overview'/&gt;

{{quote|The objective of the Aurora Programme is first to formulate and then to implement a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life. |ESA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/The_European_Space_Exploration_Programme_Aurora]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Aurora programme was a response to Europe's Strategy for space which  was endorsed by [[European Union Council of Research]] and the ESA Council.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Aurora_s_origins]&lt;/ref&gt; Europe strategy for space had three main points including:"explore the solar system and the Universe", "stimulate new technology", and "inspire the young people of Europe to take a greater interest in science and technology".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the foundational principles of the Aurora program is recognising the interdependence of technology and exploration;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt;

==Missions==
[[Image:ExoMars model at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|ExoMars rover model (for the 2020 launch)]]
The first decade is planned to focus on [[robot]]ic missions.

===Flagship missions===
[[File:ExoMars 2016 Launch.jpg|thumb|ExoMars launches in 2016]]
ESA describes some Aurora programme missions as "Flagship" missions. The first Flagship mission is [[ExoMars]], a dual robotic mission to [[Mars]] made in cooperation with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roskosmos). It will involve development of a Mars orbiter ([[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]), a technology demonstrator [[lander (spacecraft)|descent module]] (Schiaparelli lander) and the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1NVZKQAD_0.html | title = ExoMars | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship missions considered for the Aurora programme include:
* ''[[ExoMars]]'', consisting of an uncrewed Mars orbiter and lander launched jointly with the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2016 on Proton rocket with Fregat upper stage.
* [[ExoMars rover]] launch to be conducted jointly the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] in 2020
* a robotic ''[[Mars Sample Return Mission]]'' by the mid-2020s 
* a human space mission to be launched in the mid-2030s

===Arrow missions===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
''Arrow missions'' are technology demonstrator missions focused on developing a certain technology needed for the Flagship missions. Approved Arrow missions so far (as of January 30, 2003):
*''Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule'', a step in the preparations for the ''Mars Sample Return'' mission.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*''Mars aerocapture demonstrator'', to further develop the technologies for using a planet's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] to brake into orbit. This particular mission seems to have been revised into an expanded mission to demonstrate "aerobraking/aerocapture, solar electric propulsion and soft landing" to be launched in 2020. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Timeline==
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
The proposed Aurora roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXZY274OD_index_0.html |title=Aurora’s roadmap to Mars / Exploration / Human Spaceflight / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=2003-12-19 |accessdate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as of September 30, 2005. This roadmap can, and most likely will, go through revisions):
* 2014 – Human mission technologies demonstrator(s) to validate technologies for orbital assembly and docking, life support and human habitation{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2016 and 2020 – [[ExoMars rover]] to Mars. The scientific objectives include exobiological studies as well as study of the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study ExoMars|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/exomars|publisher=UK Government Space Agency|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2024 – Human mission to the Moon{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2026 – Automatic mission to Mars{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* 2030s – First human mission to Mars, as a split mission. The proposed Ariane M rocket may be used for this landing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The human part of the programme has been challenged by the main ESA contributors (France, Germany and Italy), making it quite possible that the whole Aurora Programme will be refocused on robotic-only exploration of Mars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Among American [[Adolescence|adolescents]], '''baseball metaphors for sex''' are often used as [[euphemism]]s for the degree of [[physical intimacy]] achieved in [[Human sexual activity|sexual encounters]] or relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism|first1=Steven L.|last1=Hellermann|first2= Andrei S.|last2=Markovits|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069107447X|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the metaphor, first prevalent in the [[aftermath of World War II]], sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of [[baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Gender|first=Suzanne|last=Romaine|year=1999| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0-8058-2926-1|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Ages, Life in the United States, 1945–1960|first=Marty|last=Jezer| year=1982|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0-89608-127-3|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and popularity==
Among the most commonly used metaphors are the ''bases'' describing levels of physical intimacy (generally from a heterosexual perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of the terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Third Base Ain't What it Used to Be: What Your Kids Are Learning About Sex Today—and How to Teach Them to Become Sexually Healthy Adults | author=Levkoff, Logan | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4qhuD3G0-8C | chapter=Sex Talk Among Teens | publisher=Open Road Media | year=2012 | isbn=9781453262924}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English | author=Dalzell, Tom | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neVBmSyNRnEC | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | isbn=9781134194780}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender of Sexuality: Exploring Sexual Possibilities |author1=Rutter, Virginia  |author2=Schwartz, Pepper  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbpIbqiEy2sC | year=2012 | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn=9780742570030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''First base'' – mouth-to-mouth [[kissing]], especially [[French kiss]]ing;
*''Second base'' – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the [[Human breast#Sexual characteristic|breasts]]; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any [[erogenous zones]] through the clothes (i.e., not actually touching the skin), or [[Mutual masturbation|manual stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Third base'' – touching below the waist (without [[sexual intercourse]]); in some contexts, it may instead refer to [[oral sex|oral stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Home run'' (''home base'' or ''scoring'')&amp;nbsp;– "full" sexual intercourse.

Additionally,
*''Strikeout'' – a failure to engage in any form of [[foreplay]] or other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]];

Additionally, there are two metaphors used to refer to [[men who have sex with men]]:
* ''Pitching '' – the man performing [[anal sex]]
* ''Catching''  – the man receiving anal sex

Other similar metaphors include:
* ''Switch hitter''  – a bisexual individual, referencing a player who can bat from either side
* ''Playing for the other team''  – usually indicating a person is gay or lesbian
* ''Playing for both teams''  – usually indicating a person is bisexual

The metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one well-known example in the [[Meat Loaf]] song "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]", which describes a young couple "[[making out]]", with a [[voice-over]] [[Sports commentary|commentary]], by baseball announcer [[Phil Rizzuto]], of a portion of a baseball game as a metaphor for the couple's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=pearlman/070816|title=Phil and Meat Loaf will always have "Paradise"|first=Jeff|last= Pearlman|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example can be found in [[Billy Joel]]'s song "[[Zanzibar (Billy Joel song)|Zanzibar]]" in which he compares himself to [[Pete Rose]] and sings the lines "Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd steal it if she only gave the sign. She's gonna give the go ahead, the inning isn't over yet for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of Billy Joel|first=Ken|last=Bielen|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313380167|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Letterman]] chronicled many of these in his "Top Ten Baseball Euphemisms for Sex" &amp;mdash; a recurring theme on the [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten Lists]] featured on the late-night talk shows he hosted before his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Letterman, David (2001-09-19). [http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/top_ten/?year=2001&amp;month=09&amp;day=19&amp;direct=true Top Ten Baseball Euphemisms for Sex]. ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Retrieved 2010-04-30. (Search the "Top Ten" archive by the show date [http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/top_ten/ here].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex education==

Educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective instructional tool when providing sex education to [[middle school]] students.&lt;ref name=Cooperstown&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture 1998|first1=Alvin L.|last1=Hall|first2=Thomas L.|last2=Altherr|chapter=Eros at the Bat: American Baseball and Sexuality in Historical Context|pages=157–182|year= 2002|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0954-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leman and Bell, in their book ''A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex'', make use of it to aid parents in the discussion of [[puberty]] with their children, dividing the topics into "first base" ("Changes from the neck up"), "second base" ("Changes from the neck to the waist"), "third base" ("Changes from the waist down"), and "home plate" ("The Big 'It'").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex|first1=Kevin|last1=Leman|first2=Kathy Flores|last2=Bell|year=2004|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=031025096X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative views==

This sequence of "running the bases" is often regarded as a script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on [[safe sex]] to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the "home run" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel]] conversely state that "third base" is now sometimes considered to comprise oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor to "full" (i.e. penetrative) sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing it Down Under: The Sexual Lives of Australians|author=Juliet Richters and [[Chris Rissel]]|year=2005 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1-74114-326-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scent of Eros: Mysteries of Odor in Human Sexuality|first1= James V.|last1=Kohl|first2=Robert T.|last2=Francoeur|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=059523383X|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these activities, Chicago Wilderness played a major role in protecting and replenishing the naturally occurring [[ecosystems]] in the Chicago area as well as motivating people to become more aware and involved in the preservation of these lands and waters. Chicago Wilderness had continued to blossom through the funding and donations of many sources including private contributions, the member organizations, and state and federal [[grants]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Wilderness."

==History==

In the 1970s the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory selected the best quality surviving [[natural]] habitats within the state. All of these areas combined constituted seven-hundredths of one percent of the original [[land mass]] it once covered.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Stephen. "Chicago Wilderness." Encyclopedia of Chicago. Ed. Janice L. Reiff, Ann D. Keating, and James R. Grossman. Chicago Historical Society, 2005. Web. 21 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/328.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this dramatic decrease of naturally occurring ecosystems, the Chicago Region Biodiversity Council, or Chicago Wilderness, was formed in 1996. This collection of 34 separate organizations, including state, local, and federal agencies, joined forces as they all shared a common vision consisting of the restoration and improvement of the [[biodiversity]] of the Chicago area. In 2002, Chicago Wilderness established its Corporate Council.&lt;ref&gt;Jerozal, Jim. "Chicago Wilderness And its Corporate Council." Illinois Sustainable Technology Center. Ed. Bob Iverson. [[Prairie Research Institute]], 2012. Web. 22 Jan. 2012. &lt;http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/govs_awards_docs/2008-GP2A-Jerozal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Corporate Council, which includes 34 organizations, was created to influence a healthy relationship between people and nature and to continue to increase the biological diversity within the region.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;Chicago Wilderness. [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]], 2011. Web. 21 Jan. 2012.&lt;http://www.chicagowilderness.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was established, Chicago Wilderness has increased its member count to over 250 different public and private organizations who work together to conserve and protect these diminishing ecosystems.

On March 29, 2017, the leadership of Chicago Wilderness announced that the Chicago Wilderness Trust would be ceasing operations effective March 31. This message stated that its Chair and Vice Chair, and their alliance partner organizations, were "committed to working with the Executive Council and other alliance members to determine the best strategy for moving forward".&lt;ref name="CWTransition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagowilderness.org/news/338001/Chicago-Wilderness-Transition.htm|title=Chicago Wilderness Transition|date=29 March 2017|author=Game, Catherine|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 5, 2017 email from the Chair and Vice-Chair, a "Status Report" was provided about the progress of an Ad Hoc Transition Working Group transitioning the organization from a staffed one to a volunteer-driven effort.

==Land Area==
Chicago Wilderness stretches from southwest [[Michigan]], to northwest [[Indiana]], reaching through northern [[Illinois]], and southern [[Wisconsin]]. It is home to a variety of ecosystems sustaining life to thousands of native plants and animal species, including almost 200 listed [[endangered]] or [[threatened species]] in Illinois.&lt;ref name=ChicagoZoo&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The various ecological communities contain: [[prairies]], woodlands, including [[savannas]], open woodlands, [[flatwoods]] and [[forests]], [[wetlands]], which encompass [[marshes]], [[sedge]] meadows, [[bogs]], [[seeps]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[swamp]]s, [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Four Main Initiatives==
Chicago Wilderness has four major initiatives it strives to improve through its presence: Climate Change, Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People, Leave No Child Inside, and Restoring the Health of Local Nature.&lt;ref name=USFishWildlife&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Included in these core projects, the Chicago Wilderness alliance encompasses a variety of other programs to benefit the members of the [[community]] as well as the land they are preserving.

===Climate Change===
The [[climate change]] initiative of Chicago Wilderness focuses primarily on addressing the effects of climate change on the Chicago wilderness region and ways to respond to these changes. Studies have shown the impact of climate change has on the world, but little is known about how it affects specific regions. Recently, both Chicago Wilderness and the Nature Conservancy published reports to address the issues the area faces as the climate changes, both from the perspective of the city and the region's wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;April, Kelly. "Conservationists around Great Lakes Plan for Climate Change - Chicago Tribune." Featured Articles From The [[Chicago Tribune]]. 28 Aug. 2011. Web. 10 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-28/news/ct-met-climate-change-conservation-20110828_1_climate-change-warmer-winters-great-lakes&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the reports, the Chicago Wilderness Alliance also developed the Climate Action Plan for Nature, which has established plans for the city of Chicago ([[Chicago Climate Action Plan]]), the city of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], and the [[University of Illinois]]. The Climate Action Plan has five strategies it is currently working on: Energy efficient buildings, clean and renewable energy sources, improved transportation options, reduce waste and industrial pollution, and finally adaption. Green-covered roofs on some of Chicago's buildings are key features of projects implemented as part of their climate action plan.&lt;ref&gt;"Cities and Climate Change: Greening the Concrete Jungle | The Economist." [[The Economist]] - World News, Politics, Economics, Business &amp; Finance. Web. 10 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/21528272&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Infrastructure Vision===
As according to Chicago wilderness, Green Infrastructure is defined as "the interconnected network of land and water that supports biodiversity and provides habitat for diverse communities of native flora and fauna at the regional scale." The Green Infrastructure Vision (GIV) was proposed in 2004. Its main purpose is to create a healthy region that plays a role in the quality of life of residents, to increase the economic liveliness of the region and to bring the [[nature]] to the people by protecting, preserving, restoring and managing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Wilderness Green Infrastructure Vision." Chicago Wilderness. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Ser.]], Mar. 2004. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.chicagowilderness.org/pdf/Green_Infrastructure_Vision_Final_Report.pdf&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313200041/http://www.chicagowilderness.org/pdf/Green_Infrastructure_Vision_Final_Report.pdf |date=March 13, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1.8 million acres that are potential areas of expansion, protection, restoration and connection for the GIV in Southwest [[Wisconsin]], [[Northeast Illinois]], Northwest Indiana, and Southwest [[Michigan]].

Chicago wilderness works to put the green infrastructure vision into action by focusing on four main scales: Regional, Community, Neighborhood and Site. At a regional level, CW members work with regional agencies. By looking at future plans and policies, they can focus on including conservation developmental and preservation principles that promote and sustain community health. In the community, land use ordinances and plans will be reworked to enhance people friendly design, while integrating such principles as [[sustainability]], biodiversity and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. GIV works at a neighborhood level to further promotion of conservation, preservation and access to nature in communities. At a more specific level, they work with specific sites to encourage use of [[rain gardens]], rain barrels (also known as [[rainwater tanks]]), and [[natural landscaping]] in open spaces in the community.&lt;ref&gt;"Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People."

SWAT focuses at the scale of neighborhoods and communities.&lt;ref&gt;"SUSTAINABLE WATERSHED ACTION TEAM ARCHIVE." [[Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning]] Publications. N.p., n.d.

===Leave No Child Inside===
The Leave No Child Inside Initiative focuses on connecting children of all ages with the nature in their region. Projects sponsored by this initiative give children and teens the opportunities to explore nature, camping, and service learning projects.&lt;ref&gt;Leave No Child Inside, Chicago Wilderness Initiative. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Ser, n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.kidsoutside.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was created in sync with the movement, [[No Child Left Inside (movement)]]. This movement has prompted other states to start their own programs similar to the one of Chicago Wilderness; Leave No Child Inside, [[Greater Cincinnati]] &lt;ref&gt;Leave No Child Inside, Greater Cincinnati. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.lncigc.org/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  and No Child Left Inside, [[Connecticut]] &lt;ref&gt;State Of Connecticut: No Child Left Inside. State of Connecticut, n.d. Web. 12 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://www.ct.gov/ncli/site/default.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; are just a few.

===Restoring the Health of Local Nature===
The Restoring the Health of Local Nature initiatives main purpose is to help return the environment in the Chicago region to its once healthy condition. The Chicago Wilderness has implemented projects that allow people to enjoy clean air, water and help restore and preserve their environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Health of Local Nature." Chicago Wilderness. U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Ser, n.d.

Chicago Wilderness sponsors 15 different sites at which volunteers can help at on this day.&lt;ref&gt;"NPLD in Your Town: Chicago." [[National Public Lands Day]].

==Accomplishments==
Since 1996, Chicago Wilderness has undertaken more than 500 environmental projects in the Chicago region. The foundation has received over 38 grants totaling over $15 million to support conservation projects.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Accomplishments — Chicago Wilderness." Chicago Wilderness.

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}
'''Christian deism''' is a standpoint in the [[philosophy of religion]], which branches from [[Christianity]]. It refers to a deist who believes in the moral teachings—but not divinity—of [[Jesus]]. Corbett and Corbett (1999) cite [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;!--Discuss on talk page before removing!--&gt; as exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corbett and Julia Mitchell Corbett, ''Politics and religion in the United States'' (1999) p. 68
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest-found usage of the term ''Christian deism'' in print in English is in 1738 in a book by [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_fP-TKe-PwC&amp;pg=PA189 | title=The moral philosopher: In a dialogue between Philalethes a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew | first=Thomas | last=Morgan | authorlink=Thomas Morgan (deist) | year=1738}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing about ten times by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22christian+deism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpJ0TbX-JpHmsQPxhcTQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3ADec+31_2+399%2Ccd_max%3A1799-12-31&amp;tbm= |title=Googlebooks.com search for "Christian Deism" before 1800.}} In most cases it was used to name a group that the author opposed.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''Christian deist'' is found as early as 1722,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Christianity vindicated against infidelity | first=Daniel | last=Waterland | year=1722 | page=63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in ''Christianity vindicated against infidelity'' by Daniel Waterland (he calls it a misuse of language), and adopted later by [[Matthew Tindal]] in his 1730 work, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Christianity as Old as the Creation | first=Matthew | last=Tindal |authorlink=Matthew Tindal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIOAAAAIAAJ | year=1730 |pages=368 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deism is influenced by [[Christianity]], as well as both main forms of deism: classical and modern. In 1698 English writer Matthew Tindal (1653–1733) published a pamphlet "The Liberty of the Press" as a "Christian" deist.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{dubious|date=July 2011|reason= also vague in terms of meaning}} He believed that the state should control the Church in matters of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, ''Hermeneutics: An Introduction'' (2009) p 137&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=October 2012}}

It adopts the ethics and non-mystical teachings of Jesus, while denying that Jesus was a deity. Scholars of the founding fathers of the United States "have tended to place the founders' religion into one of three categories—non-Christian deism, Christian deism, and orthodox Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;The faiths of the founding fathers, by David Lynn Holmes, p. 163 (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] and [[John Tillotson]], especially, inspired Christian deism, through their respective writings.&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 579 (1985)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly the most famed person to hold this position was Thomas Jefferson, who praised "nature's God" in the "Declaration of Independence" (1776) and edited the "[[Jefferson Bible]]"—a Bible with all reference to revelations and other miraculous interventions from a deity cut out.

In an 1803 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Jefferson states that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the "Christian system" in a conversation with [[Benjamin Rush]] during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the "deism and ethics of the Jews", and concluding with the "principles of a pure deism" taught by Jesus, "omit[ting] the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration."&lt;ref name="Correspondence"&gt;[http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/jefferson_m_03.html Excerpts from the Correspondence of Thomas Jefferson] Retrieved 12 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deists see no paradox in adopting the values and ideals espoused by Jesus without believing he was God. Without providing examples or citations, one author maintains, "A number of influential 17th- and 18th-century thinkers claimed for themselves the title of 'Christian deist' because they accepted both the Christian religion based on revelation and a deistic religion based on natural reason. This deistic religion was consistent with Christianity but independent of any revealed authority. Christian deists often accepted revelation because it could be made to accord with natural or rational religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'', Edgar V. McKnight, p. 96 (1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Deism===
Deism is a [[Humanism|humanist]] theological position (though encompassing a wide variety of view-points) concerning God's relationship with the [[Nature|natural world]] which emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century enlightenment]].

Deists reject atheism,&lt;ref name="González1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justo L. González|title=The Reformation to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=14 Aug 2010|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060633165|pages=190–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of different types of deists in the 17th and 18th century.

Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] that he configured when he created all things. Because God does not control or interfere with his self-sustaining Creation, its component systems work in concert to achieve the balanced natural processes that make up the physical world. As such, Human beings are "free agents in a free world." A "free agent" is someone who has authority and ability to choose his/her actions and who may make mistakes. A "free world" is one which ordinarily operates as it is designed to operate and permits the consequential properties of failure and accident to be experienced by its inhabitants. God is thus conceived to be wholly [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and never [[immanent]]. For deists, human beings can only know God via [[reason]] and the observation of nature but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles)—phenomena which deists regard with caution if not skepticism.

Christian deism is one of several branches of deism to have come about over time:
{{quote|Over time there have been other schools of thought formed under the umbrella of deism including Christian deism, belief in deistic principles coupled with the moral teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and [[Pandeism]], a belief that God became the entire universe and no longer exists as a separate being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/what-is-deism What Is Deism?], Douglas MacGowan, ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'', May 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[Williston Walker]], in ''A History of the Christian Church'', wrote: "In its milder form, it emerged as 'rational supernaturalism,' but in its central development it took the form of a full Christian Deism, while its radical wing turned against organized religion as anti-Christian Deism."&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"/&gt; "English Deism on the whole was a cautious, Christian Deism, largely restricted in influence to the upper classes. But a radical anti-Christian Deism, militant in its attack on organized Christianity, though with few supporters, accompanied it."&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 584 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

An early Christian deist wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For God, according to these [[Philosophers]], makes and governs a natural World that is capable of governing itself, and that might have made itself as well, had they not pass'd a needless and insignificant Compliment upon, the Creator. But I hope they will mend their Scheme, and compound this Matter for their own Honour, and not pretend to fay, that God has made a necessary World, or a self-existent System of Creatures. Yet this is the philosophical Scheme of Atheism, which its Patrons would fain call Deism, and in which the Christian Jews or Jewish Christians assist them, by joining inadvertently in the fame Cry. But if this be not a fine Scheme of Philosophy, let Christian Deism stand for an odd Sort of Religion, and let the Christian Jews be for ever orthodox, and be allow'd as the only religious Men in the World. It is certain, that if God governs moral Agents at all, he must; govern them by Hope and Fear, or by such a wise and suitable Application of Rewards and Punishments, as the different Circumstances of Persons, and the Ends of Government require. And these Rewards and Punishments must be such as are not the natural, necessary Consequences of the Actions themselves, themselves, since every one must see that this would be no Government at all, and that the Case, in this Respect, must be the very same whether we suppose any rectoral Justice, or any Presence or Operation of God in the World or not. And yet this which is really no Government at all, is all the general Providence which some seem willing to allow. But since those Gentlemen are all deep Philosophers, and above the gross Ignorance of the common Herd, I would here only ask them, What are the Laws of Nature ? What is the Law of Gravity, the Law of communicating Motion from one Body to another by Impulse, and the Law of the Vis -Inertia of Bodies ? Are these natural, essential and inherent Properties of the Bodies themselves, or are they the regular Effects of some universal, extrinsick Cause acting incessantly upon the whole material System, by such and such general Laws and Conditions of Agency?&lt;ref&gt;The moral philosopher: in a dialogue between Philalethes, a Christian deist and Theophanes a Christian Jew. By Thomas Morgan, 189-190 (1737).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This may give the Reader some Notion of this Writer's Candour and Sincerity, and what we are to think of his pretended Regard for Christianity, which in Effect amounts to this: That the Christianity revealed in the Writings of the New Testament is Jewish Christianity; that is, Christianity corrupted and adulterated with Judaism, which according to him is the worst Religion in the World. But the true and genuine Christianity is Christian Deism, to be learned not from the Writings of the New Testament, but from the Volume of Nature, from every Man's own Breast, from the Heavens, the Earth, and especially the Brute Creatures,the genuine uncorrupted Instructors in our Author's Christianity. So that the "Gentlemen that assume to themselves the Title of Deists, seem resolved that for the future they only shall be called the true Christians too. Those that look upon the New Testament to be divinely inspired, and receive it as the Rule of their Faith, and take their Religion from thence, must be called Christian Jews, who only put a strange Mixture of inconsistent Religions upon the World for Christianity : whereas these Christian Deists teach it in its Purity, and in order to propagate pure uncorrupted Christianity they do their utmost to discard.the Writings of the New Testament, that Is, the Writings that give us aft Account of the Doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles, But since these Gentlemen will not allow; us the honorable Title of Christians, it is but fair that they should leave us that of Free-Thinkers, to which I really think the Advocates for the Gospel Revelation have a much juster Pretension than they.&lt;ref&gt;''The divine authority of the Old and New Testament asserted'', by John Leland, p viii-ix (1739)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christian foundation===
In conjunction with deistic perspectives, Christian deism incorporates Christian tenets. Christian deists believe that [[Jesus Christ]] was a deist. Jesus taught that there are two basic laws of God governing humankind. The first law is that life comes from God and we are to use it as God intends, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the [[Attic talent|talents]]. The second law is that God intends for human beings to live by love for each other, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.

Jesus summarized two basic "commandments" or laws of God as "love for God and love for neighbor." These two commandments through Christian deism were known to Jesus from the Hebrew scriptures but Jesus expanded the definition of "neighbor" to include everyone concerned in the natural world. "Love for God" means having appreciation for God as the creator of the world and the source of human life. "Love for neighbor" means having appreciation for the value of every human life. These are not laws or "truths" that Jesus received through some supernatural "revelation" according to Christian deism. In his "parable of the sower," Jesus taught that the "word of God" is known naturally because it is sown "in the heart" of everyone. For instance, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who was a Jew, recognized that God's laws are known naturally by everyone. Paul wrote, "When Gentiles (non-Jews) who do not have the (Mosaic) law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15). Christian deism is therefore based on appreciation for all creation and on appreciation for every human life.

In his teachings, Jesus used examples from the natural world and from human nature to explain basic truths about life. In his parables, Jesus spoke of mustard seeds, wheat, weeds, fishing nets, pearls, vineyards, fig trees, salt, candlelight and sheep to illustrate his points. Jesus also used illustrations from human nature to teach basic concepts such as repentance, forgiveness, justice, and love.

Jesus called for people to follow God's laws, or commandments, so the "kingdom of God" could come "on earth as it is in heaven." As Jesus preached the "gospel", or good news, that the "kingdom of God is at hand," Christians deists believe the Romans viewed Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary seeking to liberate the Jews from Roman rule. Jesus refused to stop preaching his "gospel" even though he knew that he was risking crucifixion, the usual Roman penalty for revolutionaries. Jesus called for his followers to take this same risk, "If a man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it" (Mark 8:34-35).

After his crucifixion, Jesus' cross became a symbol of commitment to establishing the "kingdom of God" on earth. Christian deists are committed to following God's natural laws, as summarized in the two "commandments" to love God and love our neighbor.

==Different schools of thought==
The broad spectrum of thought available within the idea of a Christian deism encompasses models of [[Deism#The history of classical deism|classical deism]] and [[pandeism]] with simple [[Reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the message of [[Toleration|tolerance]] claimed as espoused by the human Jesus, to belief in Jesus as a sort of naturally occurring divine figure, a mystical product of the rational processes of a rational [[universe]]. An example of the broadness attributed to Christian deism is found in this criticism of the position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christian Deist, i.e., a man who alleges that the Christian religion is nothing else than pure natural religion. The Deist, whom he introduces speaking, speaks with great presumption, as the ignorant are accustomed to do: that he neither possessed any acquaintance with the ancient languages nor with history, which he betrays in the very beginning, awakens no good anticipations in favour of Morgan, who appears in the person of the Deist. Morgan alleges with great boldness, that his religion of reason alone is divine, that the Christian is a mere invention and device of man, and through all ages since its introduction, has been regarded as such by a small but oppressed party: that the character of [[Judaism]], which is not only human, but altogether devilish, cleaves still to the followers of a blind faith': that the apostle Paul was the chief of the freethinkers who wished to have no connexion with Judaism, and alone preached Christianity in its purity, whilst the other apostles were merely the chiefs of a political party who in the spirit of Judaism had attached themselves to it.

....

The freer Paulinian party, according to Morgan's view, had been from the first always persecuted and oppressed by the others; and although the Jewish Christians had afterwards fallen asunder and separated into various hostile sects, the same intolerant Jewish spirit still, in a greater or a less degree, animated them all, and they would not consent to relinquish the service of sacrifices; this spirit has given birth to a religion of priests among all those sects, which is immeasurably removed from the true religion. In addition, Morgan will not at all admit that his opinions approach in any respect to atheism, or that his object is to defend any thing similar to it; he alone, as he alleges, is a teacher of the true moral religion. It will not therefore be a matter of surprise, that a division of his book treats of the public forms of divine worship, and especially upon prayer. On the other hand, his Christian Deist will have nothing to do with sacrifices or satisfaction,—nothing with the vicarious death of Christ,—nothing with sacrifices and ceremonies,—with grace or election, which does not depend upon the merit of the person elected.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth'', by F.C. Schlosser, p. 47 (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christian deists do not worship Jesus as God. However, there are differing views concerning the exact nature of Jesus, as well as differing levels of hewing to traditional, orthodox deistic belief on this issue. There are two main theological positions.

===Jesus as the Son of God===
Of the Christian deists who look upon Jesus as the Son of God, (but not God himself), the Christian aspect of their faith is drawn from three main aspects of prior Christian thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightenmentdeism.com/?page_id=156 |title=Christian Deism |publisher=Enlightenment Deism |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They take a modified view of [[Pelagius]], that there is no need for divine aid in performing good works and that the only "grace" necessary is the declaration of the law. They also hold a mild version of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] philosophy. They combine these two philosophies with certain aspects of classical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology. Indeed, mainstream deistic thought contributed to the rise of Unitarianism itself, with people in the 19th century increasingly self-identifying as Unitarians rather than as deists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Campbell Mossner|Mossner, Ernest Campbell]] (1967). "Deism". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Vol. 2. Collier-MacMillan. pp. 326–336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus as a moral teacher===
Christian deists who do not believe in Jesus as the son of God strongly reject any theories of atonement.

Different theories receive different levels of rejection, the strongest rejection being reserved for the theory of [[penal substitution]], that claims that Jesus had to die as a sacrifice to pay the "death penalty" for humankind and save them from the "wrath" of God. And they do not view God as a whimsical tyrant who sends plagues and pestilence to punish people on earth and who plans to torture people in "[[hell]]" in the future. Christian deists reject these ideas as products of human hatred and a failure to recognize God's natural laws of love for others.

Christian deists consider themselves to be disciples, or students, of Jesus because Jesus taught the natural laws of God. But Christian deists believe that Jesus was only human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925150953/http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus had to struggle with his own times of disappointment, sorrow, anger, prejudice, impatience, and despair, just as other human beings struggle with these experiences. Jesus never claimed to be perfect but he was committed to following God's natural laws of love.

==Diverging from Christianity and deism==
Christian deism can differ from both mainstream deism and orthodox Christianity. This can occasionally be on the same subject but most often, Christian deism finds itself in agreement with one on a given theological topic, only to disagree on the next theological topic.

Christian deism is opposed to the doctrine of predestination in which everything that happens is thought to be the will of God, and instead tend to believe in the concept of free will. [[John Calvin]] was a proponent of the theory of predestination in which God allegedly determines everything that happens, whether good or bad. Christian deists believe that it is never God's will for anyone to be sick or injured. In that bad things occur as a result of prior interactions that resulted in a specified outcome. These bad things may be caused by interfering with naturalistic processes that result in negative consequences to carbon-based life, or by human interaction on the surface of the Earth that leads to degrees of inhospitable conditions for others. Christians deists believe God gifted the human intellect to heal many illnesses, but God does not directly intervene to heal people on demand by some supernatural occurrence. Humans are believed to already have the endowed capacity to create synergies and contribute in some way toward the development of fairer societies on Earth, whether it be through scientific understanding or spiritual enlightenment. However, Christian deists also strongly oppose the mainstream deistic notion that sacred texts like the Bible contain no revealed truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-deist.blogspot.com/ |title=the christian deist café |publisher=Christian-deist.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christiandeism.com/beliefs/ |title=Beliefs |publisher=Christiandeism.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation of [[cultural heritage]] involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walston, S.|year=1978|page=9 |title=The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums|journal= ICCM Bulletin |volume=4 |issue= 1|url=http://www.aiccm.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=319:the-preservation-and-conservation-of-aboriginal-and-pacific-cultural-material-in-australian-museums&amp;catid=79:1978-iccm-bulletin-volume-4-no-4&amp;Itemid=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with [[Collection (artwork)|art collections]] and [[museum]]s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.&lt;ref name = Szczepanowska2013&gt;Szczepanowska, Hanna M.. 2013. Conservation of cultural heritage: key principles and approaches. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415674744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:
* Minimal intervention;
* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".&lt;ref&gt;[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G. Einaudi, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Key dates===
{{main article|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]], but more ancient examples include the work of [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|page=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730/Cassiodoro_alle_origini_dellidea_di_restauro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief history===
[[File:Achter de schermen van het Rijksmuseum Weeknummer 50-11 - Open Beelden - 30641.ogv|thumb|An early video showing some activities in a conservation laboratory at the [[Rijksmuseum]]]]
[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Arles Conservation.jpg|thumb|A temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]
The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41. [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41 “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present”] in (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105–120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. "Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present". The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is "Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis" and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is "Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis". It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for [[lining of paintings|relining]] paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Patent# 2,073,802 [http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. "Art of Oil Painting Restoration"], March 16, 1937. Patft1.uspto.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

==Ethics==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858 AIC – Code of Ethics]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caring for cultural heritage==

===Collections care===
{{Main article|Collections care}}
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation – Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]
A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility – Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

==Conservation laboratories==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==

===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index]. Heritagepreservation.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Victoria and Albert conservation.jpg|thumb|Conservation in Progress note, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (2014)]]
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. culture.gov.uk. October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. The Institute of Conservation. icon.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| "No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected." }}

{{quote|"It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions. The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document." }}

Concluding: {{quote| "When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'
So would we."}}

Further to this the ICON website summary report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=15 The Future of Museums: A Failure of Vision]. Icon.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following specific recommendations:

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK-based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled ''It's a material world: caring for the public realm'',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. [http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm]. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

{{quote|"conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action"}}

==Training==
{{main article|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AIC training" &gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC – Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].

Conservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".&lt;ref name="AIC training" /&gt;

In France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). 

==Associations and professional organizations==
{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC – Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

The '''conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of items of historical and personal value made primarily from [[paper]], [[parchment]], and [[leather]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] conservation activities are generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Paper-based items, such as [[books]], scrapbooks, [[manuscripts]], maps, deeds, [[newspapers]], drawings, water colors, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Even paper [[ephemera]] like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, "Preservation Measures for Newspapers", Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/newspap.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was [[Alfred Bonnardot]]'s ''Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres'', first published in Paris in 1846.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Jeremy |title=Alfred Bonnardot Issues the First Book on the Restoration of Rare Books and their Bindings (1846) |website=HistoryofInformation.com |url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrov"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrov |first1=Ferdinand |title=The art of painting and the art of restoration |date=2015 |publisher=Ferdinand Petrov |location=Vancouver, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Inherent vice ===
[[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|Inherent vice]] is "the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain".&lt;ref&gt;National Postal Museum, "Inherent Vice," ''Smithsonian'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stamp/5d_preserving3.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries.&lt;ref name="CCI418"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Paper Documents and Newspaper Clippings |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of [[lignin]] in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the [[cellulose]], which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time.&lt;ref&gt;Dava Tobey, "Preserving History," ''Minnesota Historical Society'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/nytimes_preserving.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;ref name=S30&gt;Shelley (1992), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books are inherently complex; they are often made of mixed materials ranging from parchment, leather, fabric, adhesives and thread. Some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. [[Iron gall ink]], most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions.&lt;ref name="CCI419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Books |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002|accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used to make books contain hundreds of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) that break down over time. They are released into the air, where they become detectable as "old-book smell". A book's smell can provide conservators with hints as to its condition. Decomposing [[cellulose]] emits [[furfural]], which has an almond-like scent. [[Lignin]] releases [[benzaldehyde]] and [[vanillin]] with a vanilla smell. [[Hexanal]] from cellulose and lignin gives off an earthy smell.  Researchers have attempted to profile the smell of old books and relate human perceptions of smell to their chemical sources. “Chocolate” and “coffee”  are the most frequently used descriptors from the Historic Paper Odour Wheel.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derieux"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lattuati-Derieux |first1=Agnès |last2=Bonnassies-Termes |first2=Sylvette |last3=Lavédrine |first3=Bertrand |title=Identification of volatile organic compounds emitted by a naturally aged book using solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |date=February 2004 |volume=1026 |issue=1-2 |pages=9–18 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2003.11.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephemera]], as the name implies, was never made to survive. Flyers, postcards, and programs are often printed on poor quality paper, carelessly handled, and likely to be haphazardly displayed or stored.&lt;ref name=L33&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pests ===
Insects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles.&lt;ref name=MCB&gt;Mary C. Baughman, “Approaches to Insect Problems in Paper and Books,” ''Harry Ransom Center'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/conservation/resources/insects/].&lt;/ref&gt; Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; To best discourage infestation, a clean and dust-free environment is desirable: food and drink should be kept away from storage areas. If pests are discovered, they should first be identified so that appropriate measures can be taken.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; Freezing the collection items is an option for pest mitigation: ideally (for dealing with most insects) the center of the item should be frozen within four hours at a temperature of -20&amp;nbsp;°C (about -4 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 72 hours, following which the materials may be thawed over a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and [[fumigation]] is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

=== Environmental conditions ===
Extremes of temperature or relative [[humidity]] are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high).&lt;ref name=S29&gt;Shelley (1992), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather book bindings to crack.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerates mold growth, [[foxing]], staining, blooming, disintegration, and "[[red rot]]" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat.&lt;ref&gt;Cameo, "Cockling", ''Museum of Fine Arts Boston'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Cockling].&lt;/ref&gt; Precise environmental levels for optimal preservation will depend on whether the collection is for use, storage, or a combination: in general, a cool environment (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and relatively dry air (between 30-50% relative humidity) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, "Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation", ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Air quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects.&lt;ref name=SLV&gt;State Library of Victoria, "Caring for Works on Paper", ''State Library of Victoria'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/explore/conservation-guides/caring-works-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

All kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.

===Handling===
[[File:RDZ des Historischen Archivs der Stadt Köln - Gefriertrocknungsanlage und Archivgut-2278.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A paper conservator handling a book.]]
Other than a poor environment, poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; Recommendations for good handling to minimize damage include:
* A clean work area and clean hands. Food and drink should be kept away from collection materials, and smoking avoided. Hands should be washed and dried immediately before handling collection items. Hand lotions, creams and wipes should never be used prior to handling items.&lt;ref name=HRC&gt;Harry Ransom Center, “Ransom Center Guidelines: Safe Handling of Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts,” ''The University of Texas at Austin'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/pubmnem/MEM_RR_Handling_8_10%20rev.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gloves should be worn only when absolutely necessary, as they may reduce dexterity and feeling.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; If worn, they should be clean white cotton gloves. 
* Loose clothing, jewelry, or buttons, may all cause damage, and should be kept under control. The user should ensure he or she is seated or standing in a stable position. Precautions should be taken if he or she is suffering from a cold.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
* The bookmarking of pages by use of paper clips, acidic inserts, or the folding of page corners should be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of rubber bands, self-adhesive tape, any kind of "leather dressing", or glue should all be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCSOB&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Books," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/books.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Adhesives can leave stains and a damaging residue.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; 
* A book should not be forced further than its natural opening. Instead, the covers may be propped on foam wedges to decrease the opening angle, and the pages held open using book snake weights.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The turning of pages by the top corner instead of the bottom may help prevent tears.&lt;ref name=L36&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The pages of a bound manuscript should be turned slowly, and the leaves flexed as little as possible, because decorations and inks may no longer be firmly attached to parchment leaves.&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt;
* Books should be removed from the shelf by gripping on both sides of the spine at the middle (having, if necessary, pushed in the neighboring book on both sides to get a good grip).&lt;ref name=LOCSOB /&gt; Both hands should be used when removing large or heavy books from a shelf. If the volume is horizontal in a stack of books, the books above it should be removed first.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Pencil, not ink, should be used to make any necessary marks or inscriptions. Inscriptions should only be made when the paper is on a clean hard surface to avoid embossing the inscription into the paper.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;
* A work in paper should not be lifted by its edges. Instead, a thin support such as a folder or foam board should be used.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;Dixie Nielson, "Object Handling," in ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'', eds. Rebecca Buck and Jean Allman Gilmore. (Washington, DC: AAM Press, 2010), 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parchment is not as flexible as paper, and is more resistant to unfolding. It should not be forced.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photocopying that forces books to lie flat should be avoided. This may damage the spine and weaken pages.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Items should not be piled on one another, and, for oversized items, a large clear space should be prepared. Maps and blueprints that have been rolled may be gently unfolded or unrolled if they are not brittle or weak. They can also be placed under light weight for a few weeks to relax.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage methods and materials ==
[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|thumb|250px|A paper conservator surveying a collection of materials in storage.]]
Good storage can extend the life of an item and is an important aspect of preventative conservation. Storage should be cool, dry, clean, and stable.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt; Items should be kept away from radiators or vents, which can cause environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;

Manuscripts and paper documents should be stored in protective archival-quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials.&lt;ref name=OSE&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, “Storage Enclosures for Books and Artifacts on Paper,” ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.4-storage-enclosures-for-books-and-artifacts-on-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Documents that might be handled often may be stored or encapsulated in a clear [[polyester]] (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials.&lt;ref name=OSE /&gt; Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube.&lt;ref name=L42&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the rolled item may also be covered with archival quality paper.&lt;ref name=L42 /&gt;

The best shelving for books is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt; If a book is removed from the shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt;

==Active conservation and repair techniques==
*'''Surface cleaning''': Paper and leather can be dusted with a soft brush, and dust can be removed from books with a vacuum cleaner that has a cheesecloth tied over the nozzle.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt; Nonchemical vulcanized rubber sponges or nonabrasive erasing materials such as vinyl erasers are also used. Care must be taken: an inappropriate cleaning technique could permanently ingrain dirt or remove media.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
*'''Mold and insect removal''': Insect accretions and mold residues are normally removed by scalpels, aspirators, or specialized vacuum cleaners. Deep freezing may be appropriate to kill insects.&lt;ref name=NUA&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Works of Art and Unbound Artifacts on Paper," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.5-conservation-treatment-for-works-of-art-and-unbound-artifacts-on-paper]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adhesive removal''': Some adhesive materials are acidic and harmful to paper, causing stains. Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue can be removed in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and pressure-sensitive (self-adhering) tapes usually have to be dissolved or softened with an organic solvent before they can be removed. Steam is sometimes helpful to remove adhesive.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Washing and alkalization''': Washing not only removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; it can also wash out acidic compounds and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an alkaline buffer to paper is sometimes recommended for de-acidification. Alkalization can be achieved by immersion or by spraying.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Mending and filling''': Severe tears that cannot be stabilized with polyester film can usually be mended on the reverse with narrow strips of torn [[Japanese tissue]]. The strips are adhered with a permanent, nonstaining adhesive such as starch paste or methyl cellulose. Holes or paper losses may be filled individually with Japanese paper, with paper pulp, or with a paper carefully chosen to match the original in weight, texture, and color.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Sewing and rebinding''': Books with broken sewing, loose or detached boards or leaves require special care.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Several techniques are used in conservation binding. The original sewing in a volume should be retained if this is possible; it can be reinforced using new linen thread and sewing supports.&lt;ref name=NBM&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Bound Materials of Value," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.6-conservation-treatment-for-bound-materials-of-value]&lt;/ref&gt; If the original binding is too deteriorated, the book may be rebound with new archival safe materials. An alternative to a leather-covered laced-in structure is a split-board structure, which can be covered in leather or cloth.&lt;ref name=NBM /&gt; 
*'''Backing''': Weak or brittle paper may be reinforced by backing them with another sheet of paper. Again, Japanese paper can be used as a backing, adhered with a starch paste.
*'''Flattening''': Flattening is always necessary following aqueous treatment. Flattening is also helpful for rolled or folded paper that cannot gently and safely be opened. It is usually done between blotters or felts under moderate pressure.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Emergencies and disasters''': Most natural or man-made disasters, such as floods or fire, involve water. Even a small amount of water from a leaky roof or pipe can do significant damage to a paper collection. Immediate response by a knowledgeable professional or agency within the first 48 hours is crucial to the successful salvage of materials and the prevention of mold growth. Wet paper or books may be frozen to stabilize them; they can be thawed and dried at a later time.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt;

== Reformatting options ==
Reformatting options include photocopying, [[Digitizing|digitization]], and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;

In spite of the [[digital revolution]], preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dalton. [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/6.-reformatting/6.1-microfilm-and-microfiche "Microfilm and Microfiche"]. ''Northeast Document Conservation Center''. Accessed 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional conservators ==
In general, the cleaning and repair of paper documents and books should ideally be assigned to a professional conservator.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CYT&gt;AIC, "Caring for Your Treasures," ''American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures#.U13JgK1dX4g].&lt;/ref&gt; Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) or the [[Guild of Bookworkers]] (both in the United States), or the [[Archives and Records Association]] (in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor artworks''' is the activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of artworks that are exhibited or permanently installed outside. These works may be made of [[Wood art|wood]], [[Stone sculpture|stone]], [[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|ceramic material]], [[Plastic arts|plastic]], [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|bronze]], [[Conservation and restoration of copper-based objects|copper]], or any other number of materials and may or may not be painted.  When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

==Environmental issues==
Unlike many works of [[cultural heritage]], outdoor artworks are not exhibited in a controlled environment, where [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] are closely monitored.  Though works may be more easily preserved in a controlled environment, they are installed outside to preserve the [[Artist's statement|artist's intent]], and avoid decontextualization.&lt;ref name="Chiantore"&gt;Chiantore, Oscar, and A. Rava. (2005).  ''Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, outdoor works are exposed to many and various [[environmental factors]] depending upon its geographic or site location and its configuration.&lt;ref name = "Naude"&gt;Naudė, Virginia N. (1985). ''Sculptural Monuments in an Outdoor Environment''.  Philadelphia, PA: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental threats may include, but are not limited to rain, snow, [[acid rain]], and earthquakes as well as fluctuations in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]].  They may also be exposed to excessive amounts of light as well as human intervention. Excessive rain and moisture can also lead to mold growth.  Daily exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]], [[Visible light|visible]], and [[Infrared light|infrared (IR)]] radiation has a detrimental effect on painted sculptures or those with organic or inorganic coatings. Excessive light exposure may cause color alterations and loss as well as structural breakdowns in the paint and coatings.&lt;ref name="Consodine"&gt;Considine, Brian B. (2010). ''Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center''. Los Angeles, CA: The Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air pollution]] can also adversely affect outdoor artworks.  In addition to meteorological conditions, traditional outdoor pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and [[ozone]] affect the various composite materials.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"&gt;Grzywacz, Cecily M. (2006). ''Monitoring for Gaseous Pollutants in Museum Environments''.  Tools for Conservation.  Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific level and type of air pollution degradation is dependent on the material and composition of the artwork as well as the length of exposure. Organic carbonyl pollutants are also an increasing threat due increased use of ethanol based fuels.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"/&gt;

==Contemporary conservation methods==
Though specific conservation methods are dependent on the material, condition, and environment for each artwork, there are some standard practices for outdoor works. These include condition assessment, treatment, [[preventive conservation]], and maintenance.

===Assessment of condition===
Before any conservation treatment, a thorough condition assessment with written and photographic documentation is completed.  This initial assessment may include research into the artist's working techniques or a discussion with the living artist, review of the conservation history of the object, and non-destructive analysis.

According to Virginia Naudé and Glenn Wharton, there are four steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture:&lt;ref&gt;Naudé, Virginia N. (1993). ''Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture''. Washington, D.C.: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Technical descriptions and condition assessments of each sculpture''': Identification and exploration of materials, fabrication, past maintenance practices, surface condition, and structural integrity. This also includes an assessment of previous repairs, treatment and/or maintenance.
# '''Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture''': Recommendations based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection. The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment.
# '''Assignment of priorities to recommended activities''': [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]]-assigned priorities based on the previously attained technical information. These priorities will later be assessed by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities.
# '''Estimate of resources required''': Includes labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed for conservators, technicians, and other specialists. An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately. Supplies and equipment costs are also included.
 
===Treatment of outdoor artworks===
The treatment of outdoor artworks is multifaceted and dependent on the material type, condition, structural integrity, and exhibition conditions. A brief overview of conservation treatments by material is outlined below, and more thorough discussions are available on the individual conservation pages.

* [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|Bronze sculptures]]: For many bronze sculptures and other metal sculptures, treatment includes a reduction buildup from previous protective coatings, removal of corrosion and incrustation, or cleaning.  This may be done by hand, water blasting, air abrasion, or other methods.  Then, a wax or wax composite is applied to the sculpture in sweeping motions.  Finally, the wax is buffed with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Kipper, Patrick V. (1996). ''The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the Collector''.

*[[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|Ceramic sculptures]]: Ceramic sculptures are much less common than bronze sculptures, and require a different conservation and maintenance procedures.  Mechanical and chemical cleaning methods may be used, and previous conservation treatments and adhesives may be removed.  Next, consolidation of fragments and flaking glaze may be completed.  For sculptures comprised with multiple ceramic parts joined with mortar, the grout may also require conservation intervention.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;
*[[Plastic arts|Plastic sculptures]]:  Plastic elements are prevalent in contemporary sculptures.  Outdoor sculptures may be made entire or in part of [[polyester]], [[epoxy]], [[phenol]], or [[Acrylic resin|acrylic materials]].&lt;ref name="Chiantore"/&gt; Unfortunately, treatment for plastic sculptures may be limited as some changes from degradation in plastics are not reversible.
*Painted sculptures:  As Brian Consodine writes, painted sculptures are actually a multi-layered composition that can contain [[primer (paint)|primer]]s, [[paints]], and [[protective coatings]] as well as the structural substrate.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;  Problems that may occur with painted sculptures include degradation or alteration of color, cracking and flaking of paint, and failure of the primer layer which exposes the underlying primary support to the elements.  Treatments for painted sculptures may include reduction of previous coatings and repairs, cleaning, consolidation, and inpainting of losses.

===Preventive conservation===
[[File:Tool used to maintain a bronze sculpture.JPG|thumb|Wax and a brush used to maintain a bronze sculpture.]]
[[Preventive conservation]] involves actions taken to delay deterioration of [[cultural heritage]].  For outdoor artworks, this usually involves the application of a protective coating and regular maintenance.  The particular protective coating is chosen based on its durability, adhesion to the surface, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance on the work.&lt;ref name="Naude"/&gt; The coating provides some protection from [[environmental factors]], but must be occasionally be reduced and reapplied for best results.  A long-term conservation schedule should be created and implemented to ensure the longevity of the artwork.  A maintenance walk-through schedule should also be established to routinely check the condition of the objects.  This may be a weekly procedure; it is useful as conservators can assess and document any damage caused by visitors or environmental conditions, and may rinse and wipe down sculptures.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;

{{Cyber anthropology}}
'''Cyborg anthropology''' is a discipline that studies the interaction between humanity and technology from an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective. The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.

== History ==
[[Donna Haraway]]’s 1984 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"]]''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"A Cyborg Manifesto"]] was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled "Cyborg Anthropology", which cites Haraway's "Manifesto". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Gary Lee|last2=Dumit|first2=Joseph|last3=Williams|first3=Sarah|year=1995|title=Cyborg Anthropology|url=|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume=10|pages=264-269|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-group was closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Amber Case]] has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/amber-case/|title=Amber Case, Cyborg Anthropologist Information, Facts, News, Photos -- National Geographic|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology|last=Case|first=Amber|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1494773519|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Joshua|date=2014|title=Keep Calm and Remain Human: How We Have Always Been Cyborgs and Theories on the Technological Present of Anthropology|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00938157.2014.872460|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=43|pages=5-34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is "about seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caseorganic.com/2008/11/robots-robots-everywhere-a-field-guide-to-cyborg-anthropology/|title=Robots, Robots, Everywhere – A Field Guide to Cyborg Anthropology {{!}} The World is not a desktop|website=caseorganic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://cyborganthropology.com/Main_Page The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki], overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.

== Methodology ==
Cyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[cybernetics]], [[feminist theory]], and more.  It primarily focuses on how people use  discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.downey.sts.vt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1995-Cyborg-Anthropology-.pdf/|title= Cyborg Anthropology: Anthropologies of the Body {{!}} Volume 10, Number 2, May 1995 |website=downey.sts.vt.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== 'Cyborg' origins and meaning ===
Originally coined in a 1960 paper about [[space exploration]], the term is short for cybernetic organism.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.scribd.com/doc/2962194/Cyborgs-and-Space-Clynes-Kline?autodown=pdf Cyborgs and Space]," in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.&lt;/ref&gt; A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, [[insulin pump]]s, and [[bionic]] limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyborg Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Gray|editor-first=Chris Hables|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cybercultures Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-18378-2|editor-last=Bell|editor-first=David|location=|pages=291-324|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto|quote=|editor-last2=Kennedy|editor-first2=Barbara|via=Georgetown University Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital vs. cyborg anthropology ===
{{Main|Digital anthropology}}

[[Digital anthropology]] is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://savageminds.org/2012/03/22/digital-anthropology-group-is-happening-now/|title=Digital Anthropology Group Is Happening Now|last=Thompson|first=Matt|date=2012-03-22|website=Savage Minds|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like [[genetics]] and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.

== Key concepts and research ==

=== Actor–network theory ===
{{main|Actor–network theory}}
Questions of [[subjectivity]], agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]]. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture ([[Silicon Valley]]), government sanctions ([[net neutrality]]), specific innovative humans ([[Steve Jobs]]), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), proposed by [[Bruno Latour]], is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory|last=Latour|first=Bruno|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyborganthropology.com/Defining_Cyborg_Anthropology|title=Defining Cyborg Anthropology - Cyborg Anthropology|website=cyborganthropology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Wells explain how new forms of networked political expression such as the [[Pirate Party]] movement and [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source software]] philosophies are generated from human reliance on information technologies in all walks of life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Researchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines|last=Richardson|first=Kathleen|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1138831742|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at [[University of California, Berkeley]] suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|date=2012-01-15|title=The ethnography of robots|url=http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/01/15/the-ethnography-of-robots/|journal=Ethnography Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Posthumanism ===
The most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/|title=American Anthropological Association|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. 

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] of technology [[Zeynep Tufekci]] argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered "posthuman" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the "posthuman" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally "subhuman" (like marginalized groups within a society).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human No More? Digital Subjectivities, Unhuman Subjects, and the End of Anthropology|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|last2=Wesch|first2=Michael|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60732-170-5|location=Boulder|pages=1-21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''dBc''' ('''decibels relative to the [[Carrier wave|carrier]]''') is the power ratio of a signal to a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] signal, expressed in [[decibels]]. For example, [[phase noise]] is expressed in dBc/[[Hertz|Hz]] at a given [[frequency]] offset from the carrier. dBc can also be used as a measurement of Spurious-Free Dynamic Range ([[Spurious-Free Dynamic Range|SFDR]]) between the desired signal and unwanted spurious outputs resulting from the use of signal converters such as a [[digital-to-analog converter]] or a [[frequency mixer]]. 

If the dBc figure is positive, then the relative signal strength is greater than the carrier signal strength.  If the dBc figure is negative, then the relative signal strength is less than carrier signal strength.

Although the [[decibel]] (dB) is permitted for use alongside [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the dBc is not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Taylor 1995, Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI), NIST Special Publication SP811]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6281">'''Dally''' (division abnormally delayed) is the name of a gene that encodes a HS-modified-protein found in the fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). The protein has to be processed after being codified, and in its mature form it is composed by 626 amino acids,&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;[https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q24114 Uniprot KB],&lt;/ref&gt; forming a proteoglycan rich in heparin sulfate which is anchored to the cell surface via covalent linkage to [[glycophosphatidylinositol]] (GPI), so we can define it as a [[glypican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nakato H |author2=Tracy A |author3=Selleck S.B |title=The division abnormally delayed (dally) gene: a putative integral membrane proteoglycan required for cell division patterning during postembryonic development of the nervous system in Drosophila|journal=Development|year=1995|issue=121|pages=3687–3702}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its normal biosynthesis it requires sugarless (''sgl''), a gene that encodes an enzyme which plays a critical role in the process of modification of dally.

==Dally’s  function==
[[File:Glypican.jpg|thumb|Dally acts as a coreceptor for Frizzled, the receptor of the Wnt]]

Dally works as a co-receptor of some secreted signaling molecules as fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and members of the [[Wnt signaling pathway]], TGF-b and Hedgehog families. It is also necessary for the cell division patterning during the post-embryonic development of the nervous system.

It is a regulatory component of the Wg receptor and is part of a multiprotein complex together with [[Frizzled]] (Fz) transmembrane proteins. Therefore, it regulates two cell growth factors in Drosophila melanogaster, Wingless (Wg) and [[Decapentaplegic]] (Dpp). It must be said that in vertebrates the equivalent to Dpp are Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, and the mammalian equal to Wg might be integrin-beta 4. The first one (Wg) controls cell proliferation and differentiation during embryos development, specifically in epidermis, whereas the latter (Dpp) plays a role in the imaginal discs’ growth.

Dpp and Wg are mutually antagonistic in patterning genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emerald B.S |author2=Roy J. K |title=Organising activities of engrailed, hedgehog, wingless and decapentaplegic in the genital discs of Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Development Genes and Evolution|year=1998|volume=208|pages=504–516|doi=10.1007/s004270050209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretely, dally selectively regulates both Wg signalling in epidermis and Dpp in genitalia. This selectivity is supposed to be controlled by the type of [[Glycosaminoglycan]] GAG bonded to the dally protein, considering that there is a huge structural variety in GAGs.

Tissue malformations occur in various situations. As said in the introduction, the ''sgl'' enzyme is essential for a normal biosynthesis of dally. That is why the absence or malfunction of this enzyme doesn’t allow the correct Wg and Dpp signalling. Also the expression of mutated dally proteins alters Wnt signalling pathways, which leads to anomalies in Drosophila melanogaster’s eye, antennal, genital, wing and neural morphogenesis.

[[File:Location dally.jpg|thumb|Dally's location in chromosome 3]]

==Gene location==
Dally's gene was located in the chromosome 3, concretely in the region 3L 8820605-8884292.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;[http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0263930.html FlyBase],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutations and its effects==
The mutation of Dally is a consequence of the [[P-element]] and the place where it is located. It is possible to differentiate between the mutants Dally-P1 and Dally-P2, depending on where the insertion of P-element is. It is known that Dally-P2 generates a bigger amount of defects. This mutated Dally disrupts the cell cycle progression, delaying the process during the G2-mitosis transition. As a matter of fact, mutations affecting Dally disrupt patterning of many tissues, for instance of the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Varki A, Cummings R, Esko J, Freeze H, Stanley P, Bertozzi P, Hart G, Etzle M |title=Essentials of Glycobiology, 2nd edition|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87969-770-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dally mutants display cell cycle progression defects in specific sets of dividing cells. Those mutations are pleiotropic and can affect viability and produce morphological defects in several adult tissues, such as the eye, antenna, wing and genitalia.

==Treatment==
Once the mutation has been codified and the protein is functional, there is no chance to turn back and we will speak about a mutated individual. However, if the mutant dally is codified but it is not performing its function yet, a chaperone can identify it and try to correct the mutation, or directly send it to a proteasome using ubiquitins and degrade it.

Notwithstanding, there is another possible solution when malformations have occurred as a result of Wg activity loss. Ectopic dally can potentiate Wg signaling but this effect is dependent on some Wg activity remaining at the cell surface. Moreover, [[ectopic expression]] of dally+ from hs-dally+ transgene, stimulates Wg signaling. Thus, naked larval cuticle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tsuda M, Kamimura K, Archer M, Fox B, Olson S |title=The cell-surface proteoglican Dally regulates Wingless signaling in Drosophila|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=400|pages=276–280|pmid=10421371|doi=10.1038/22336|issue=6741}}&lt;/ref&gt;  loss is recuperated and once the larva has become an adult, its tissues execute their normal function. Despite this fact, an intense expression of dally+ results in the death of most of the Drosophila melanogaster’s embryos.

[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of a de Laval nozzle, showing approximate flow velocity (v), together with the effect on temperature (T) and pressure (p)]]
A '''de Laval nozzle''' (or '''convergent-divergent nozzle''', '''CD nozzle''' or '''con-di nozzle''') is a tube that is pinched in the middle, making a carefully balanced, asymmetric [[hourglass]] shape. It is used to accelerate a hot, pressurized [[gas]] passing through it to a higher [[supersonic]] speed in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into [[kinetic energy]]. Because of this, the [[nozzle]] is widely used in some types of [[steam turbines]] and [[rocket engine nozzle]]s. It also sees use in supersonic [[jet engines]].

Similar flow properties have been applied to [[Jet (fluid)|jet streams]] within [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= C.J. Clarke and B.

This principle was first used in a [[rocket engine]] by [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Most modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de Laval nozzles.

==Operation==

Its operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] and [[supersonic]] speeds. The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the [[mass flow rate]] is constant. The gas flow through a de Laval nozzle is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (gas [[entropy]] is nearly constant). In a subsonic flow [[sound]] will propagate through the gas. At the "throat", where the cross-sectional area is at its minimum, the gas velocity locally becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called [[choked flow]]. As the nozzle cross-sectional area increases, the gas begins to expand and the gas flow increases to supersonic velocities where a sound wave will not propagate backwards through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the nozzle ([[Mach number]] &gt; 1.0).

==Conditions for operation==

A de Laval nozzle will only choke at the throat if the pressure and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach sonic speeds, otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a [[Venturi tube]]; this requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the [[stagnation pressure]] of the jet must be above ambient).

In addition, the pressure of the gas at the exit of the expansion portion of the exhaust of a nozzle must not be too low. Because pressure cannot travel upstream through the supersonic flow, the exit pressure can be significantly below the [[ambient pressure]] into which it exhausts, but if it is too far below ambient, then the flow will cease to be [[supersonic]], or the flow will separate within the expansion portion of the nozzle, forming an unstable jet that may "flop" around within the nozzle, producing a lateral thrust and possibly damaging it.

In practice, ambient pressure must be no higher than roughly 2–3 times the pressure in the supersonic gas at the exit for supersonic flow to leave the nozzle.

==Analysis of gas flow in de Laval nozzles==

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:

* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].
* The gas flow is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (i.e., at constant [[entropy]]). As a result, the flow is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (i.e., there is no heat gained or lost).
* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.
* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to [[exhaust gas]] exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)
* The gas flow behaviour is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the flow is at very high [[velocities]] (Mach number &gt; 0.3).

==Exhaust gas velocity==

As the gas enters a nozzle, it is moving at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat contracts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the smallest, the axial velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the axial velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].
  
The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 1.22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton| title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=6th|pages=636| publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|year=1992|isbn=0-471-52938-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_e = \sqrt{\frac{TR}{M} \cdot \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \cdot \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

|align=left|= [[pressure|absolute pressure]] of exhaust gas at nozzle exit,

|}

Some typical values of the exhaust gas velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for rocket engines burning various propellants are:

* 1,700 to 2,900&amp;nbsp;m/s (3,800 to 6,500&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[monopropellant]]s,
* 2,900 to 4,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (6,500 to 10,100&amp;nbsp;mph) for liquid [[bipropellant]]s,
* 2,100 to 3,200&amp;nbsp;m/s (4,700 to 7,200&amp;nbsp;mph) for [[solid rocket|solid propellant]]s.

As a note of interest, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes referred to as the ''ideal exhaust gas velocity'' because it based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.

As an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of ''T'' = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor ''γ'' = 1.22 and a molar mass ''M''&amp;nbsp;= 22&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2802&amp;nbsp;m/s, or 2.80&amp;nbsp;km/s, which is consistent with above typical values.

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'', which applies to any [[ideal gas]], or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R/M''.

In developmental [[biology]] and [[zoology]], '''defeminization''' is an aspect of the process of [[sexual differentiation]] by which a potential female-specific structure, function, or behavior is changed by one of the processes of male development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/defeminization|title=Defeminization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term might seem to imply "removal" of female characteristics, in nearly all biological contexts it refers to ''prevention'' of an aspect of female development from manifesting.

In human [[biology of gender]], the best known example of this is the prevention of development of the [[müllerian duct]] derivatives by [[anti-müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in the 3rd and 4th months of [[fetus|fetal]] development, though the term is not commonly used in discussions of human development.

In a number of non-human [[mammal]]s, there is evidence that hormones produced by the testes act directly on the [[brain]] to prevent development of female characteristics, especially female [[Animal sexual behavior|reproductive behavior]].

'''EcocyclET''' is a system that removes pollution through [[evapotranspiration]], using plants' requirements for water and nutrients to filter wastewater.

==History==
First known as the Waste Water Garden, the EcocyclET is a bio-engineered system whose technologies were developed and licensed by David Del Porto of the [[Ecological engineering|Ecological Engineering]] Group in Concord, MA, from a concept originally conceived and tested by [[University of Toronto]] [[environmental engineering]] professor [[Alfred Bernhart]] (''"Evapotranspiration Nutrient uptake Soil infiltration of Effluent water”'' A.P. Bernhart).

In 2004, Centre for Sustainable Watersheds completed the installation of Canada’s first EcocyclET. This prototype was initiated to demonstrate a [[Sustainable design|sustainable technology]] for rural wastewater management, ensuring zero discharge to the ground.

==Method==
Most plants use photosynthesis and [[evapotranspiration]] (ET). EcocyclET is a closed-loop operation that employs lined beds of sand, crushed stone and gravels and specified plantings. Effluent from [[septic tank]]s, [[greywater]], [[composting toilet]]s leachate or urine from separating toilets, is recirculated through the bed. There, naturally occurring [[Microorganism|micro-organisms]] convert the chemical constituents of the wastewater into nutrients for plants growth. The impervious bed liner ensures that no effluent can enter the subsurface environment or nearby receiving waters. All the wastewater will be ultimately transpirated as un-transpirated effluent is drained back into a recycle tank, stored and pumped back to the bed when the conditions for [[evapotranspiration]] are optimal.
The system can also by used as a greywater reuse planter to be installed where soils are too poor to be considered for a soil absorption system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11127">'''Environmental health ethics''' is a field of study that combines environmental health policies and ethical consideration towards a mutually acceptable goal. Given the myriad of environmental issues facing society today a sound ethical background can be applied in an attempt to reach a compromise between conflicting interests, like [[anthropocentrism]], global stewardship, religious values, economic development, and public health. A small sample of the scientific disciplines involved in environmental health ethics include: [[ecology]], [[toxicology]], [[epidemiology]], and [[exposure biology]].

==Ethical approaches==

===[[Virtue ethics|Virtue]] theories===

===[[Christian]] ethics===

===Natural rights===

===[[Kantianism]]===

===John Stuart Mill's [[Utilitarianism]]===

===Richard Brandt's [[Richard Brandt|Utilitarianism]]===

===W. D. Ross's [[W. D. Ross|view]]===

==Environmental health topics==

Environmental health embodies a wide range of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues can be traced back to a moral obligation towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma [[social justice]], equality, sustainability, and [[globalism]] to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the volume of issues at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.

# State the question or problem.
# Gather the relevant information.
# Explore different opinions.
# Apply ethical principles to the different options.
# Resolve any conflicts among ethical principles.
# Take action.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and DeMarco 2000; Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Shamoo and Resnik 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling on a methodology for analyzing different ethical situations we can turn to a broad survey of some of the most relevant issues which face humanity today.

==Pest control==
[[Pesticide]]s are used throughout the world in an attempt to control, repel, or kill pest species. Though many species of insect can be commonly identified throughout the world, others may harm human health and well-being while providing a benefit to the overall environment of an area. One example of the phenomenon is a bee's ability to sting an individual who may have a serious allergic reaction, though they also play a crucial role in the pollination of an ecosystem. A further example would be various species of bat, which though they can transmit rabies, also help to control mosquito populations.
 
Perhaps the biggest event in the history of pesticide use is the widespread use of [[DDT]] to control various pests, including mosquitoes and lice. Its long-term effects had not been sufficiently documented and thus it was assumed to be of low toxicity. Over time the widespread use of DDT began to have serious environmental and human health consequences. Organisms further up the food chain showed significant amounts of DDT in their tissues and this presence had adverse health effects, for example, the weakening of predatory bird eggshells and fish kills. Adverse effects among humans included endocrine system disruption which can lead to reproductive complications.

Among the most disruptive pesticides are those dubbed [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) which do not break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation referred to as the Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[toxaphene]].&lt;ref&gt;Robson et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With these considerations in place it falls onto lawmakers to regulate responsible use of pesticides, and ethics can provide a starting point to consider the best option. Extensive use of pesticides would improve life in the short-term but be harmful in the long-term, and completely banning their use would likewise be detrimental to overall environmental and human health. One strategy to encourage is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM), in which pesticides are responsibly used to limit agricultural loss but also watched for growing resistance and environmental toxicity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also taken measured to educate clinicians and the public about relevant issues and the best ways to manage pesticide use.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic engineering, food, and nutrition==
[[Genetic engineering]] concerns the application of scientific alteration of plant and animal DNA in order to combat pests, disease, drought, and other factors which can adversely harm the organism. Objections to [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) include theological (playing God) and economic (GMOs can be costly) viewpoints. Genetic engineering of both plants and animals must pass through FDA legislation, which may include public labeling of the product or otherwise marking it as genetically modified.

Food and nutrition also fall under the category of things regulated by the FDA, however, the ethics of this regulation are not always clear. Health consequences of unsafe food, eating in overlarge quantities, are well documented yet in all societies there is no legislation against over-consumption. Ethical properties of utilitarianism and [[social justice]] conflict with humanity's freedom of choice in the determining of access to healthy, safe food.

==Pollution and waste==
Air, water, and solid waste pollution are environmental health issues which can adversely affect people, plants, and animals. From an ethical standpoint many things about pollutants can be studied, like questions of disposal, storage, recycling, and responsibility. A few examples of air pollutants include particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxides, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and [[toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Perhaps the largest ethical debate concerning [[air pollution]] is how to balance economic development against the interests of the [[public health]], safety, and cleanliness. With both sides offering benefits and drawbacks it can be difficult to establish an acceptable compromise. Legislation enacted to prevent widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons, which cause significant environmental damage, can be seen as one instance of economic development taking a lower priority to public health.

Water pollution is another type of widespread contaminant which has ethical implications in mitigating the source and balancing conflicting priorities. The two types of water contaminants are anthropogenic compounds (generally referred to as pollutants, such as disinfection products, metals, municipal and agricultural waste, and petroleum and coal hydrocarbons) and natural contaminants (such as microorganisms or chemicals like arsenic and nitrogen, which are naturally present in the soil). the common misconception is that chemicals leaking into the soil will be diluted over time and rendered harmless. This theory does not take into account persistent organic pollutants, which do not break down easily, and sometimes break down into more harmful constituents. Most industrialized nations have legislation in place to protect the public from impure drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established maximum levels of pollutants in public drinking water, however its power to regulate private sources of bottled water or wells is severely limited. An additional issue regarding water pollution is the relative scarcity of clean fresh water on the earth, an issue which acutely presents itself in areas prone to drought. Agriculture uses a great deal of water, so much so that shortages in drought-prone areas can significantly affect crop yield. The main ethical issues with water pollution is whether growth should be restricted in order to preserve public health. An additional issue is the regulation of private corporations, whose activities may put populations of citizens at risk for groundwater contamination.

Solid waste pollution includes pollutants like agricultural waste, construction waste, [[electronic waste]], hazardous waste, medical, and mining waste. The two prevailing strategies for solid waste management are prevention and treatment/disposal. Waste prevention is the preferable, both economically and environmentally, as it does not necessitate costly removal and storage. Many of the same ethical issues related above manifest themselves with the handling and storage of solid waste, as well as an additional social justice issue of exactly where the storage area for solid waste should be located.

==Chemical regulation==
[[Chemical regulation]], including carbon particles and nanotubes and nanotechnology, are very new technologies whose long-term effects have not been satisfactorily studied. This lack of research argues that cautionary use of these products is warranted, especially when short-term effects include harmful symptoms. In opposition to this caution is the nanotechnology industry which is growing very rapidly and may be able to alleviate many of the problems facing society today, like selective cancer treatment and the energy crisis. Perhaps the largest obstacle to testing occurs with the sheer diversity of nanoparticles, of which the only unifying factor is their minuscule size.

'''''First Monday''''' is a monthly [[peer-reviewed]] [[open access]] [[academic journal]] covering research on the [[Internet]].

==Publication==
The journal is sponsored and hosted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. It is published on the first Monday of every month.&lt;ref name="Open Access success"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oastories.org/2011/09/denmarkus-journal-first-monday/ |title=First Monday |work=Open Access Success Stories |date=September 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the journal had an acceptance rate of about 15%.&lt;ref name="Open Access success" /&gt;

The journal has no [[article processing charge]]s and no advertisements. &lt;ref name="Open Access success" /&gt; 

==History==
According to the chief editor, Edward Valauskas, the journal emerged before the open access model emerged:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“We didn’t call it open access in 1995 but we were certainly a precursor to the whole notion of open access. We felt very strongly that the journal should have all its content made freely available and we insisted with [the Danish publisher] Munksgaard that the scholars who contributed would retain copyright of their work that they published in the journal. We felt it would encourage scholars to contribute and then re-use their content in lots of different ways".&lt;ref name="Open Access success" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''First Monday'' originated in the summer of 1995 with a proposal to start a new Internet-only, peer-reviewed journal about the Internet by eventual [[editor-in-chief]] [[Edward J. Valauskas]] to [[Wiley-Blackwell|Munksgaard]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] publisher. Munksgaard agreed to publish the journal in September 1995. The first issue appeared on 6 May 1996, the first Monday of May, also the opening of the Fifth [[International World Wide Web Conference]] in Paris. The first issue was distributed at that conference on diskette as well as released on the Internet from a server in Copenhagen at the address www.firstmonday.dk.

In December 1998, Munksgaard sold the journal to three of the editors: Edward J. Valauskas, Esther Dyson, and Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. The server was moved from Copenhagen to the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Library. The first issue based on a server in Chicago appeared 4 January 1999.

===Conferences===
The first ''First Monday'' conference took place 4–6 November 2001 in [[Maastricht]] at the International Institute of [[Infonomics]]. To celebrate ''First Monday’s'' 10th birthday in 2006, a conference took place at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 15–17 May 2006. The theme of the conference was ''Openness: Code, science and content.'' Over 200 participants from over 30 countries took part in the meeting. Papers from the Conference were published in the June and July issues. The conference was sponsored by The [[Open Society Institute]], The [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], The University of Illinois at [[Chicago University Library]] and [[The Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and Technology]] (MERIT), [[University of Maastricht]].

'''''Gassenhauer nach Hans Neusiedler (1536)''''', commonly known as '''''Gassenhauer'''''&lt;ref&gt;The title is a colloquial archaic [[German language|German]] word originally meaning lively pieces of dance music, and later used for popular songs like operetta schlager during the early record era.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈɡasn̩ˌhaʊ̯ɐ|pron}}), is a short piece from [[Carl Orff]]'s [[Schulwerk]]. As the full title indicates, it is either an arrangement of, or inspired by, a much older work by the [[lutenist]] [[Hans Neusidler]] from 1536. It (along with several other pieces) is in fact credited to Orff's longtime collaborator, [[Gunild Keetman]], on at least one recent release of the Schulwerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orff-Schulwerk, Volume 1: Musica Poetica, Celestial Harmonies 13104-2|url=http://harmonies.com/releases/13104.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other pieces from the [[Schulwerk]], it has been used multiple times on television, radio, music, and in films, including the films ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973), ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993) (in a re-worked version by [[Hans Zimmer]]), ''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999), ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003), and, most recently, Michael Moore's ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Simpsons]]''′ 22nd-season episode "[[The Scorpion's Tale]]" (2011). The piece was used as the theme music for an afternoon radio program also titled ''Gassenhauer'' on the classical music station [[WCLV]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Mark|title=Street Song / Gassenhauer: A 500 Year History|journal=Evergreen American Orff-Schulwerk Association Chapter Newsletter|year=2010|volume=34|issue=1|page=3|url=http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113202156/http://www.evergreenorffchapter.com/eocnews341.pdf|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece also has clear influences on the 1940s golden-age Argentine Tango ''vals Caballero de la luna'' by instrumentalist Enrique Rodríguez&lt;ref&gt;https://tango.info/Z0000635824.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covers ==
[[Hans Zimmer]]'s piece "You're So Cool", from his musical score to ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993), is based on this composition.

'''Gelatinous zooplankton''' are fragile animals that live in the water column in the ocean. They have very delicate bodies that are easily damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Lalli, C.M. &amp; Parsons, T.R.}} (2001) ''Biological Oceanography''. Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelatinous zooplankton are often transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Johnsen, S.}} (2000) Transparent Animals. ''Scientific American'' '''282''': 62-71. &lt;/ref&gt; All [[jellyfish]] are gelatinous zooplankton, but not all gelatinous zooplankton are jellyfish. The most commonly encountered organisms include [[ctenophore]]s, [[Jellyfish|medusae]], [[salps]], and [[Chaetognatha]] in coastal waters. However, almost all marine phyla, including [[Annelida]], [[Mollusca]] and [[Arthropoda]], contain gelatinous species, but many of those odd species live in the open ocean and the deep sea and are less available to the casual ocean observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Nouvian, C.}} (2007) ''The Deep''.

The '''''Journal of Higher Criticism''''' was an [[academic journal]] covering issues "dealing with historical, literary, and history-of-religion issues from the perspective of [[higher criticism]]", published by the ''Institute for Higher Critical Studies''. The [[editor-in-chief]] was [[Robert M. Price]].&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |title=Journal of Higher Criticism |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |url=http://www.depts.drew.edu/jhc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The periodical is held by the Library of Congress and other research libraries.

In the introductory article, the editor criticized modern biblical scholarship as "a toothless tiger or worse yet, covert apologetics wearing the Esau-mask of criticism" and advocated a return to the "golden era of bold hypotheses and daring reconstructions associated with the great names of Baur and Tübingen".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/pricejhc.html |title=Introducing the Journal of Higher Criticism |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the journal's first decade, it was sponsored by The Theological School at [[Drew University]],{{Fact|date=January 2016}} where associate editor [[Darrell J. Doughty]] taught. The final issue (volume 10, no. 2) appeared in Fall, 2003, shortly before Doughty's retirement.&lt;ref name=home /&gt;

The journal was revived in March 2018. Vol. 13, No. 1, was published to Robert M. Price's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robertmprice.mindvendor.com/JHC/jhcvol13no1_2018.pdf|title=Journal of Higher Criticism|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method for labeling virions with FSL constructs is simple, [[noncovalent bonding|non covalent]] and only involves [[Incubator (culture)|incubation]] of the virion with the FSL construct in [[Saline water|saline]] for a few hours – nothing further is required.&lt;ref name="Hadac2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; The FSL construct will spontaneously, stably and quantitatively incorporate into the [[viral membrane|virion membrane]]. Virions have been labelled with [[fluorescent]] (FSL-FLRO4) and [[Iodine 125|radioactive iodine]]  (FSL-125I). FSL-FLRO4 could be shown to label virions in a dose dependent manner and could be visualized by [[flow cytometry]] either directly, or indirectly if the virion had bound to the cell or fused with the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Blake2011" /&gt; FSLs do not appear to significantly affect the virions [[infectivity]] or their ability to bind target cells, probably because they integrate into the membrane without exposing the virion to chemical agents or covalent modification{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

'''Polymorphism''' in biophysics is the ability of [[lipid]]s to aggregate in a variety of ways, giving rise to structures of different shapes, known as "phases".  This can be in the form of spheres of lipid molecules ([[micelle]]s), pairs of layers that face one another (lamellar phase, observed in biological systems as a lipid [[bilayer]]), a tubular arrangement ([[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]), or various [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] phases (Fd3m, Im3m, Ia3m, Pn3m, and Pm3m being those discovered so far).  More complicated aggregations have also been observed, such as [[rhombohedral]], [[tetragonal]] and [[orthorhombic]] phases.

It forms an important part of current academic research in the fields of [[membrane biophysics]] (polymorphism), [[biochemistry]] (biological impact) and [[organic chemistry]] (synthesis).

Determination of the topology of a lipid system is possible by a number of methods, the most reliable of which is [[x-ray diffraction]].  This uses a beam of x-rays that are scattered by the sample, giving a diffraction pattern as a set of rings.  The ratio of the distances of these rings from the central point indicates which phase(s) are present.

The structural phase of the aggregation is influenced by the ratio of lipids present, temperature, hydration, pressure and ionic strength (and type).

==Hexagonal phases==
{{main|Hexagonal phase}}

In lipid polymorphism, if the packing ratio{{clarify|date=January 2015}} of lipids is greater or less than one, lipid membranes can form two separate hexagonal phases, or nonlamellar phases, in which long, tubular aggregates form according to the environment in which the lipid is introduced.

===Hexagonal I phase (H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;)===

This phase is favored in detergent-in-water solutions and has a packing ratio of less than one. The micellar population in a detergent/water mixture cannot increase without limit as the detergent to water ratio increases. In the presence of low amounts of water, lipids that would normally form micelles will form larger aggregates in the form of micellar tubules in order to satisfy the requirements of the hydrophobic effect.  These aggregates can be thought of as micelles that are fused together. These tubes have the polar head groups facing out, and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains facing the interior. This phase is only seen under unique, specialized conditions, and most likely is not relevant for biological membranes.

===Hexagonal II phase (H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;)===

Lipid molecules in the HII phase pack inversely to the packing observed in the hexagonal I phase described above. This phase has the polar head groups on the inside and the hydrophobic, hydrocarbon tails on the outside in solution. The packing ratio for this phase is larger than one&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Marc &amp; Boekema, Egbert. (2007). Two distinct mechanisms of vesicle-to-micelle and micelle-to-vesicle transition are mediated by the packing parameter of phospholipid–detergent systems, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6124701_Two_distinct_mechanisms_of_vesicle-to-micelle_and_micelle-to-vesicle_transition_are_mediated_by_the_packing_parameter_of_phospholipid-detergent_systems#pf9&lt;/ref&gt;, which is synonymous with an inverse cone packing.

Extended arrays of long tubes will form (as in the hexagonal I phase), but because of the way the polar head groups pack, the tubes take the shape of aqueous channels.  These arrays can stack together like pipes. This way of packing may leave a finite hydrophobic surface in contact with water on the outside of the array. However, the otherwise energetically favorable packing apparently stabilizes this phase as a whole. It is also possible that an outer monolayer of lipid coats the surface of the collection of tubes to protect the hydrophobic surface from interaction with the aqueous phase.

It is suggested that this phase is formed by lipids in solution in order to compensate for the hydrophobic effect. The tight packing of the lipid head groups reduces their contact with the aqueous phase. This, in turn, reduces the amount of ordered, but unbound water molecules. 
The most common lipids that form this phase include phospatidylethanolamine (PE), when it has unsaturated hydrocarbon chains. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG, otherwise known as cardiolipin) in the presence of calcium is also capable of forming this phase.

===Techniques for detection===
There are several techniques used to map out which phase is present during perturbations done on the lipid. These perturbations include pH changes, temperature changes, pressure changes, volume changes, etc.

The most common technique used to study phospholipid phase presence is phosphorus [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (31P NMR). In this technique, different and unique powder diffraction patterns are observed for lamellar, hexagonal, and isotropic phases. Other techniques that are used and do offer definitive evidence of existence of lamellar and hexagonal phases include freeze-fracture electron microscopy, [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC), and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (2H NMR).

Additionally, [[negative stain]]ing transmission electron microscopy has been shown as a useful tool to study [[lipid bilayer phase behavior]] and polymorphism into ''[[lamellar phase]], micellar, [[unilamellar liposome]], and hexagonal aqueous-lipid structures'', in aqueous dispersions of [[membrane lipids]].&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of thylakoid membrane lipids by sucrose. ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'' vol. 1212(1), pp. 129-133.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15042978_Destabilisation_of_lamellar_dispersion_of_thylakoid_membrane_lipids_by_sucrose?ev=prf_pub&lt;/ref&gt; As water-soluble negative stain is excluded from the [[hydrophobic]] part (fatty acyl chains) of lipid aggregates, the [[hydrophilic]] headgroup portions of the lipid aggregates stain dark and clearly mark the outlines of the lipid aggregates (see figure).

The '''Los Amigos Biological Station''' is a research station in lowland Amazonian forest at the base of [[Peru]]'s southern [[Andes]], at 270 masl in Madre de Dios department. The station's official name in Spanish is Centro de Investigación y Capacitación Río Los Amigos (Los Amigos Research and Training Center). It is commonly known by its Spanish acronym, CICRA. 
[[Image:Flowers in Los Amigos Biological Station, 2007.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Flowers in Los Amigos]]
The station sits on a high terrace at the confluence of the Madre de Dios and Los Amigos rivers. CICRA's small private property is contiguous to the Los Amigos Conservation Concession (LACC), which protects a diversity of upland and lowland forest types and aquatic habitats in 1,450&amp;nbsp;km² of the lower Los Amigos [[drainage basin|watershed]]. Population density in a 5&amp;nbsp;km radius of the station is approximately 2 persons per square kilometer, mostly itinerant gold miners working concessions along the Madre de Dios River; the 30-person village of Boca Amigos is 2&amp;nbsp;km from the station. Within the LACC, [[population density]] is zero, with the exception of occasional visits by uncontacted [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups.
[[Research]] and training facilities at CICRA include lodging for 50 visitors, 250 m2 of laboratory space, a lecture hall, a &gt;50-km trail system, a 60-m radio tower, satellite internet access, access to online scientific literature and databases, high-resolution digital aerial photos of &gt;200,000 ha of surrounding forests, a digital flora of &gt;2,500 plant species collected on-site, a 470-volume scientific library, a weather station dating to 2000, and field guides to [[fish]], [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]], and [[plants]]. Off-site resources include two smaller satellite stations, each with their own laboratories and lodging, 3 and 25&amp;nbsp;km from the main station; a GIS laboratory in nearby [[Puerto Maldonado]]; and two additional 60-m radio towers inside the conservation concession.
[[Image:Insects in Los Amigos Biological Station 2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Insects in Los Amigos]]
The station was established in 2000 by two non-governmental organizations: the Peruvian NGO Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica (ACCA) and the US-based [[Amazon Conservation Association]] (ACA). The station is administered by ACCA, in partnership with ACA and a third NGO, the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research (ACEER). The long-term vision of these groups is to make CICRA the leading field destination for researchers and students in Amazonia.

In 2005-2009, CICRA was the most active research station in the [[Amazon basin]], hosting an average of 24 researchers and assistants per day. During the same period, it was likely also the most intensively studied site in the Amazon, hosting 145 different research projects spanning animal behavior, [[biogeochemistry]], [[botany]], conservation biology, [[geology]], [[hydrology]], [[zoology]], as well as biological inventories of 31 different taxa, ranging from copepods to marsupials. These numbers place CICRA behind [[Panama]]'s Barro Colorado Island and [[Costa Rica]]'s La Selva Biological Station—the leading Neotropical research stations—but ahead of other field stations in the Amazon basin. Most research visitors are associated with universities in Peru or abroad, and many receive funding to visit the station through ACA and ACCA's grant programs.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Wetlands in Los Amigos Biological Station 2007.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Wetlands of Los Amigos]] --&gt;
Los Amigos is also a leading training site for young Amazonian scientists and conservationists.  From 2002 to 2009 the station hosted 19 field courses, ranging from introductory courses on Amazonia to specialized courses on plant identification, [[ornithology]], and arthropod biology. More than 70% of the &gt;300 students who participated in these courses were Latin American.

Through 2006, the station received the majority of its funding from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. Additional funds have come from ACEER, the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], and private donors. Since mid-2005, the station has covered its operating expenses with station fees from visiting researchers and courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">The '''Mathematical Optimization Society''' ('''MOS'''), known as the '''Mathematical Programming Society''' until 2010,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mathprog.org/?nav=mps_namechange The Mathematical Optimization Society was known as the '''Mathematical Programming Society''' (MPS) until 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214154115/http://www.mathprog.org/?nav=mps_namechange |date=2011-02-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an international association of researchers active in  [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. The MOS encourages the research, development, and use of optimization—including [[mathematics|mathematical theory]], [[:Category:Mathematical optimization software|software implementation]], and [[operations research|practical applications (operations research)]].

Founded in 1973, the MOS has several activities: Publishing journals and a newsletter, organizing and cosponsoring conferences, and awarding prizes.

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] methods were gaining increasing importance both in mathematical theory and in industrial application. To provide a discussion forum for researchers in the field arose, the journal ''Mathematical Programming'' was founded in 1970. 

Based on activities by [[George B. Dantzig|George Dantzig]], [[Albert W. Tucker|Albert Tucker]], [[Philip Wolfe (mathematician)|Philip Wolfe]] and others, the MOS was founded in 1973, with George Dantzig as its first president.

== Activities ==
=== Conferences ===
Several conferences are organized or co-organized by the Mathematical Optimization Society, for instance:
* The ''International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (ISMP)'', organized every three years, is open to all fields of mathematical programming.
* The ''Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO)'' conference, in [[Integer programming]], is held in those years when there is no ISMP.
* The ''International Conference on Continuous Optimization (ICCOPT)'', the continuous analog of the IPCO conference, was first held in 2004.
* The ''International Conference on Stochastic Programming (ICSP)'' takes place every three years and is devoted to optimization using uncertain input data.
* The ''Nordic MOS'' conference is a biannual meeting of researchers from [[Scandinavia]] working in all fields of optimization.
* At the [[Université de Montréal]], annual seminars on changing topics are organized by the MOS.

=== Journals and other publications ===
There are several publications by the Mathematical Optimization Society:
* The journal ''[[Mathematical Programming]]'' (series A/B): series A publishes articles from all fields of optimization; each issue of series B is devoted to a particular subject.
* The journal ''Mathematical Programming Computation'' 
* ''Optima'', the newsletter of the MOS, contains articles on optimization, conference information and book reviews.
* ''MPS/SIAM Series on Optimization'' is a series of books that is jointly  published by the MOS (formerly MPS) and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM). It has published [[monograph]]s, [[textbook]]s, books collecting applications of optimization, and [[tutorial]]s.

=== Prizes ===
The MOS awards prizes in the field of optimization, including the [[Fulkerson Prize]], the [[Dantzig Prize]] and the [[Tucker Prize]].

The '''Money Advice Service''' is an organisation established with cross [[Government]] party support, that provides free and impartial advice on money and financial decisions to people in the United Kingdom. It is an independent organisation whose statutory objectives are to enhance the understanding and knowledge of people about financial matters (including the UK financial system) and to enhance their ability to manage their own financial affairs.  The service provides free money advice and guidance online and by telephone.

The service was launched in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK financial advice service launched|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12960667|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding the Moneymadeclear-branded service provided by the [[Consumer Financial Education Body]]. Prior to 2010, the service had been a division of the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA). It was set up by the UK Government and is paid for by a statutory levy on the financial services industry.&lt;ref name=Milligan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Budget 2016: Money Advice Service to be abolished|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic goals and direction of the Money Advice Service are set by a 12-member board. The board is appointed by, but acts independently of, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The service has an independent Chairman and board appointed by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). The FCA’s appointments of the Chair and Chief Executive are subject to the approval of [[HM Treasury]].

In April 2012 the Money Advice Service took on additional responsibility for funding and improving the quality, consistency and availability of UK debt advice, a statutory function as set out in the [[Financial Services Act 2012]].

In March 2017 the Money Advice Service launched the new Standard Financial Statement (SFS), an initiative designed to bring greater consistency to the way organisations assess people’s finances when they are in debt.

The Money Advice Service also lead the work of a wide range of organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop the UK Financial Capability Strategy
a ten-year plan to address people’s skills and knowledge around money management, their attitudes and motivations that hold them back and their access to products and services.

In March 2016 [[HM Treasury]] announced that the service would become part of a new guidance body that would see the [https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en Money Advice Service], The [[Pensions Advisory Service]] and [[Pension Wise]] combine to form a new single guidance body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35820752|title=Money Advice Service to be abolished|last=Milligan|first=Brian|date=2016-03-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/financialguidanceandclaims.html Financial Guidance and Claims Bill] seeks to establish the new statutory body by [[Royal assent|Royal Assent]] from Autumn/Winter 2018.  The new guidance body will be accountable to Parliament, with responsibility for coordinating the provision of debt advice, money guidance, and pension guidance, ensuring that people across the UK are able to seek the help and advice they need to manage their finances.

The Bill entered the [[House of Lords]] for its first reading on 22 June 2017 and moved to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for its first reading on 22 November 2017.

The [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-speech-2017-background-briefing-notes Queen's Speech of June 2017] announced that the new single body would be funded through existing levies on pension schemes and the financial services industry.

'''Music examinations''' are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning [[musical instruments]]. These are called grades.

Although there are music [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s available to [[school]] and [[university]] students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all.

[[Trinity College London]] was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. As of 2012, Trinity College London conducts around 600,000 assessments worldwide per year, as does the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]]. Other examination boards based in the UK include the [[London College of Music Examinations|London College of Music]], [[Victoria College of Music and Drama]], the [[National College of Music]] and [[RSL (Rockschool Ltd.)|Rockschool]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rslawards.com/rockschool/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many students who enter these exams have taken a course of [[music lesson]]s with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life.

Music exams are set in both [[music theory|theory]] and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as [[musical notation]], construction of [[major scale|scales]] and [[musical composition|composition]].

The practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favored by the pupil, for example [[piano]], [[guitar]] or [[flute]]. They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including [[Musical scale|scales]], [[sight reading]], aural, musical knowledge and improvisation.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial level qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit Framework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation before the Grade 1 exam. LCM offers two Step exams at this level and VCM offers four Introductory grades aimed at those in the first 18 months of learning.

Other reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical instruments and music theory include:
* [[Australian Music Examinations Board]]
* New Zealand Music Examinations Board
* Guitarmonk Examination Board, India
* Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra (Board of music and fine arts education), India
* [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], Canada
* [[University of South Africa]] - Directorate Music
* Vienna Music Examination Board (''Wiener Musik-Prüfungskommission'')

Different music examination boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised by regulatory bodies such as Ofqual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/ Ofqual]&lt;/ref&gt;, examination results or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.

'''''Natura naturata''''' is a [[Latin]] term coined in the Middle Ages, mainly used later by [[Baruch Spinoza]] meaning "Nature natured", or "Nature already created".  The term adds the suffix for the Latin feminine [[past participle]] (''-ata'') to the verb ''naturo'', to create "natur'''ed'''".  The term describes a passive God, or more specifically, the passivity of God (substance) when it is predicated into modes, and is contrasted with the second part of Spinoza's dichotomy, ''[[natura naturans]]'', meaning "nature naturing", or "nature in the active sense". 

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is … God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2943">'''Objective abstraction''' was a British art movement c. 1933-1936.

==History==
Objective abstraction was a form of abstract art developed by a group of British artists in 1933. Experimentation was prevalent in [[British art]] at the time.

The main figures were [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]], [[William Coldstream]], [[Edgar Hubert]], [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] and [[Geoffrey Tibble]].

The movement was short-lived lasting only a few years. Many of the artists involved went on to be part of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[Euston Road School]].

==Method==
William Townsend told the [[Tate Gallery]] that 'the style originated with [[Geoffrey Tibble]] in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] [...] and at the same time or shortly after by [[Edgar Hubert]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hubert-painting-t06602/text-catalogue-entry|title=Stephens, Chris (1997) Edgar Hubert, Painting 1935-6: Catalogue entry, Tate website|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27TOWNSEND%27&amp;dsqDb=Catalog|title=William Townsend papers, University College London archive |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.

The more abstract paintings, that came to represent the movements style, were created using improvised freely applied brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/objective-abstraction|title=Objective Abstraction, Tate website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/moynihan-objective-abstraction-t00172|title=Rodrigo Moynihan, artwork 'Objective Abstraction' c.1935–6, Tate Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Tibble]] described them as 'not abstracted from nature, and which made no reference to and had no associations with anything outside themselves [...] the picture was an object in its own right' (Bowness, 1960:198).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/873008?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104397110851|title=Bowness, Alan (1960) The Paintings and Constructions of Victor Pasmore, ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 102, no. 168, May, pp. 198-203|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1934, the exhibition ''Objective Abstractions'' was held at the [[Zwemmer Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/zwemmer-gallery|title=Zwemmer Gallery, Artist Biographies website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition also included work by more representational artists, [[Ivon Hitchens]], [[Victor Pasmore]], and [[Ceri Richards]].

'''PCDitch''' is a dynamic aquatic [[ecosystem model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in [[ditch]]es. PCDitch models the nutrient fluxes in the water, the sediment and the vegetation, as well as the competition between different groups of vegetation. PCDitch is used both by scientists and water quality managers{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

==Background==

As a result of [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many [[polder]] ditches have turned from a clear water state with submerged plant dominance into a state where the water is completely covered with duckweed. Dominance of free-floating plants poses a threat to biodiversity by causing dark an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions in the water column, and is generally associated with poor ecological quality{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. 

==Application==
PCDitch predicts the existence of a 'critical nutrient load' above which one may expect duckweed coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1998, A model of ditch vegetation in relation to eutrophication. Water Science &amp; Technology 37: 139-149&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used by water resource managers to estimate the critical nutrient loading for ditch systems,&lt;ref&gt;Van Liere L, JH Janse &amp; GHP Arts, 2007. Setting critical nutrient values for ditches with the eutrophication model PCDitch. Aquatic Ecology 41: 443–449&lt;/ref&gt; and to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures such as nutrient loading reductions. A meta-model has also been developed &lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pcditch/&lt;/ref&gt; for use by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical nutrient loading based on only a few key parameters, without any need to run the full dynamic model.&lt;ref&gt;Witteveen+Bos (in Dutch) 2013. Metamodel PCDitch. Witteveen+Bos, rapport nr. STO 170-1. http://edepot.wur.nl/286383&lt;/ref&gt; PCDitch is also used by scientists to investigate the more general effects of eutrophication in ditch ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Janse, JH &amp; PJTM Van Puijenbroek, 1998. Effects of eutrophication in drainage ditches. Environmental Pollution 102: 547-552&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the competition between different aquatic plant species.

==Model content==
In essence PCDitch is a set of coupled [[ordinary differential equation]]s. With more than 40 [[state variables]] and more than 400 [[parameters]] the model is considered fairly complex{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The model describes a completely mixed water body comprising the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall [[nutrient cycle]]s for nitrogen and phosphorus are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow, [[denitrification]] and burial). Inputs to the model are: water inflow, evaporation, nutrient loading, light intensity, water temperature, sediment characteristics and depth of the ditch. Six functional groups of water plants are modelled: floating-leaved plants, emerged plants, non-rooted floating plants, non-rooted submerged [[flowering plant]]s, rooted submerged flowering plants, [[Charophyta|Charophytes]], and one phytoplankton group.
 
The default configuration of PCDitch does not take spatial heterogeneity into account. However, PCDitch can be coupled with spatial explicit hydrodynamical models to model networks of ditches{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
Although PCDitch is primarily used for Dutch ditches, the model can be applied to other non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] freshwater ecosystems where competition between primary producers is a key determinant of ecosystem functioning, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
PCDitch was calibrated with data of experimental ditches with sand and clay sediments that were exposed to different nutrient loading treatments{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. As phosphorus in PCDitch is related with aluminium, iron, lutum content (sediment particles smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;µm), [[porosity]] and [[organic matter]] content in de sediment, it is assumed that the model can also be used to describe peat ditches.

==Model development==
PCDitch is the twin-model of [[PCLake]], which is an ecosystem model for shallow lakes. Both models were developed by Dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM).&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the model has been jointly owned by PBL and Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, where further development and application of the model is taking place{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

It is through the performance of this function that individuals are inducted into the political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed.&lt;ref&gt;Varkey, K. (2003). Political Theory A Philosophycal Perspective. Indian Publishers Distributors.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools, media, and the state have a major influence in this process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Agents of socialization==
Agents of socialization, sometimes referred to as [[institution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, work together to influence and shape people's political and economic norms and values. Such institutions include, but are not limited to: [[Family|families]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[Peer group|peers]], [[School|schools,]] [[religion]]s, work and [[legal systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Agents===
# '''Family''': Families perpetuate values that support political authorities and can heavily contribute to children's initial political ideological views, or party affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VENTURA|first=RAPHAEL|date=2016|title=Family Political Socialization in Multiparty Systems|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume= 34| issue = 6|pages=666–691|doi=10.1177/0010414001034006004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families have an effect on "political knowledge, identification, efficacy, and participation", depending on variables such as "family demographics, life cycle, parenting style, parental level of political cynicism and frequency of political discussions."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kononova|first=A.|last2=Saleem|first2=A.|date=2011|title=The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students.|url=|journal=International Communication Gazette|volume= 73| issue = 4|pages=302–321|doi=10.1177/1748048511398592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# '''Schools''': Spending numerous years in school, children in the United States are taught and reinforced a view of the world that "privileges capitalism and ownership, competitive individualism, and democracy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through primary, secondary and high schools, students are taught key principles such as individual rights and property, personal responsibility and duty to their nation. 
# '''Media:''' Mass media is not only a source of political information; it is an influence on political values and beliefs. Various media outlets, through news coverage and late-night programs, provide different partisan policy stances that are associated with political participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Religion''': Religions beliefs and practices play a role in political opinion formation and political participation. The theological and moral perspectives offered by religious institutions shape judgement regarding public policy, and ultimately, translates to direct "political decision making on governmental matters such as the redistribution of wealth, equality, tolerance for deviance and the limits on individual freedom, the severity of criminal punishment, policies relating to family structure, gender roles, and the value of human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195326529-e-6|title=Religion and Political Socialization|last=Pearson‐Merkowitz|first=Shanna|last2=Gimpel|first2=James G.|date=2009-08-19|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.003.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Political parties]]''': Scholars such as Campbell (1960) note that political parties have very little direct influence on a child due to a contrast of social factors such as age, context, power, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. M. (1960). The American Voter. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''The state''': The state is a key source of information for media outlets, and has the ability to "inform, misinform, or disinform the press and thus the public", a strategy which may be referred to as [[propaganda]], in order to serve a political or economic agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Media's effect ==

=== In children ===
Political socialization begins in childhood. Some research suggests that family and school teachers are the most influential factors in socializing children, but recent research designs have more accurately estimated the high influence of the media in the process of political socialization. On average, both young children and teenagers in the United States spend more time a week consuming television and digital media than they spend in school. Young children consume an average of thirty-one hours a week, while teenagers consume forty-eight hours of media a week. High school students attribute the information that forms their opinions and attitudes about race, war, economics, and patriotism to mass media much more than their friends, family, or teachers. Research has also shown that children who consume more media than others show greater support for and understanding of American values, such as free speech. This may be because eighty percent of the media content children consume is intended for an adult audience. In addition, the impact of the messages is more powerful because children's brains are "prime for learning", thus more likely to take messages and representations of the world at face value.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-8728-7|location = |pages = |last2 = Dunaway|first2 = Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In adulthood ===
Media's role into political socialization continues in adulthood through both fictional and factual media sources. Adults have increased exposure to news and political information embedded in entertainment; fictional entertainment (mostly television) is the most common source for political information. The culmination of information gained from entertainment becomes the values and standards by which people judge.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

While political socialization by the media is lifelong process, after adolescence, people's basic values generally do not change. Most people choose what media they are exposed to based on their already existing values, and they use information from the media to reaffirm what they already believe. Studies show two-thirds of newspaper readers do not know their newspaper's position on specific issues- and most media stories are quickly forgotten. Studies on public opinion of the Bush administration's energy policies show that the public pays more attention to issues that receive a lot of media coverage, and forms collective opinions about these issues. This demonstrates that the mass media attention to an issue affects public opinion. More so, extensive exposure to television has led to "mainstreaming", aligning people's perception of political life and society with television's portrayal of it.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

=== Patterns ===
There are different patterns in socialization based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, education, geographic region, and city size. For example, generally, African Americans and Hispanics rely on television for their information more than white people. More women than men watch daytime television, and more men than women follow sports programs. Older people read more newspapers than younger people, and people from the ages of twelve to seventeen (although they consume the most media) consume the least amount of news. Northerners listen to radio programs more than Southerners do. News outlets on the East Coast tend to cover international affairs in Europe and the Middle East the most, while West Coast news outlets are more likely to cover Asian affairs; this demonstrates that region affects patterns in media socialization. Income level is also an important factor; high-income families rely more on print media than television, and consume less television than most of the population.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

Ultimately, however, the common core of information, and the interpretation the media applies to it, leads to a shared knowledge and basic values throughout the United States. Most media entertainment and information does not vary much throughout the country, and it is consumed by all types of audiences. Although there are still disagreements and different political beliefs and party affiliations, generally there are not huge ideological disparities among the population because the media helps create a broad consensus on basic US democratic principles.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

'''Production equipment control''' involves production equipment that resides in the [[shop floor]] of a manufacturing company and its purpose is to produce goods of a wanted [[Quality (business)|quality]] when provided with [[production resource]]s of a required quality. In modern [[production line]]s the production equipment is fully automated using [[industrial control method]]s and involves limited [[unskilled labour]] participation. Modern production equipment consists of [[mechatronic]] modules that are integrated according to a [[control architecture]]. The most widely known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[hetaerarchy]] and hybrid. The methods for achieving a [[technical effect]] are described by [[control algorithm]]s, which may or may not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design.

'''Robert E. (Bob) Griswold''' (born January 1, 1935, [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an American author, educator, composer and business leader, and a long-time leader in the field of [[Human Potential Movement|human potential development]]. He is the founder of Effective Learning Systems, Inc. and has authored over one hundred [[self-help]] audio programs. He is best known for his audio series The Love Tapes and While-U-Drive and his book Attract Money and More.[https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=bob+griswold&amp;sprefix=Bob+Gris]

==Biography==
Bob was born in Chicago on January 1, 1935.  He was the third son of parents William &amp; Esther Griswold, both born in Burlington, Iowa.

He attended Smyser Elementary school 1940 - 1948, Steinmetz High School, 1948–1952, Wright Junior College 1952 - 1954, and graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1957.

He married his wife Deirdre in 1963.  They have four children, Kimberly, Kevin, Robert and Jeffrey.

In 1972, he moved his family to Edina Minnesota [[Edina, Minnesota]] where he founded Effective Learning Systems, Inc. [http://effectivelearningsystems.com/] He claims to have personally taught over 50,000 people techniques for relaxation, memory, stress management, controlling habits, goal achievement and self-esteem through seminars conducted for corporations, government agencies, and the general public.[http://www.efflearn.com/success_stories.php]

Griswold has presented many conferences and workshops at the [[University of Minnesota]] and other colleges featuring world-renowned speakers such as [[Norman Cousins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Karl Menninger]], [[O. Carl Simonton]], [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Joyce Brothers]], and others. Many of these prominent professionals have become members of Effective Learning Systems' board of advisors and have contributed a great deal in their knowledge and friendship.[http://www.efflearn.com/about.php/#board]

Griswold's work soon evolved into the most popular series of individual [[self-help book|self-help audios]] in the industry. These have become the top-selling line of self-help audio programs in North American retail bookstores-including over 15 years on the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Bestsellers list, and have reached millions via mail order and the internet. His books and audios are available at [https://www.amazon.com/Robert-E.-Griswold/e/B001HMPMI0 Amazon.com], [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Robert+E.+Griswold&amp;SZE=100&amp;SRT=S Barnes &amp; Noble], [http://www.borders.com/online/store/SearchResults?view=2&amp;rpp=25&amp;type=1&amp;contrib=robert+e+griswold&amp;kids=false&amp;nav=5185&amp;simple=false Borders], and other retailers. Distribution of his books and audios has been primarily within the United States, but his programs are available throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newarrivals.nlb.gov.sg/itemdetail.aspx?bid=12797267 Bob Griswold Audio Programs at Singapore National Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same principles of improving self-esteem, which have been so effective for adults attending his seminars and listening to his tapes and CDs are now available for children on ''Songs for Self-Esteem'' for which he wrote all of the music and lyrics for this album series. He enlisted the assistance of some of the top producers, arrangers, vocalists, musicians, and studio facilities available to help realize his dream to help children make a better future for themselves and the world. [http://www.efflearn.com/product_info.php/cPath/56/products_id/149]

Griswold also served as a consultant to the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]] as Vice-President of the Minnesota Futurists and was appointed by Gov. [[Arne Carlson]] to the Minnesota Early Childhood Care and Education Council.

Griswold wrote ''How To Attract Money'' (published by Hachette Book Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/authors_Robert-E-Griswold-(1017909)_Bibliography.aspx Bob Griswold at Hachette Book Group]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly [[Warner Books]]), which deals with the relationship between self-esteem and financial success. It is based on one of his most popular self-help audio titles and has been printed in seven languages. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0446393312]

He has recently updated and expanded that work with his new book ''Attract Money and More''.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558482202]

==Ideas and teachings ==
Bob Griswold pioneered techniques for using the concepts of self-esteem, positive thinking, and the power of love to live a better life. Among the strategies and techniques that Bob has developed, copyrighted, and/or incorporated in his teaching are: a unique approach to meditative success known as Productive Meditation, Guided Imagery, Success Statements,  Mental Movie Visualization, 10 Minute Goal Setting, Whole-Brain Learning, and Music Affirmations, which are well-researched positive statements arranged and blended with carefully selected up-beat music and are featured in his While-U-Drive series of audios.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efflearn.com/about.php Effective Learning Systems, Inc. official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar radius''' is a unit of [[distance]] used to express the size of [[star]]s in [[astronomy]] relative to the [[Sun]]. The solar [[radius]] is usually defined as the radius to the layer in the [[Sun]]'s [[photosphere]] where the [[Optical_depth_(astrophysics)|optical depth]] equals 2/3:

:&lt;math&gt;1\,R_{\odot} = 6.957\times 10^5 \hbox{ km} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The solar radius is approximately {{convert|695,700|km|mi|abbr=off}}, which is about 10 times the average radius of [[Jupiter]], about 109 times the radius of the [[Earth]], and 1/215th of an [[astronomical unit]], the distance of the Earth from the Sun. It varies slightly from pole to equator due to its [[stellar rotation|rotation]], which induces an oblateness in the order of 10 parts per million. ''(See [[1 gigametre]] for similar distances.)''&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/02oct_oblatesun/ NASA RHESSI oblateness measurements 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unmanned [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] spacecraft was used to measure the radius of the Sun by timing transits of Mercury across the surface during 2003 and 2006. The result was a measured radius of {{Convert|696342|+/-|65|km|mi|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=arxiv1203_4898&gt;{{citation | first1=Marcelo | last1=Emilio | first2=Jeff R. | last2=Kuhn | first3=Rock I. | last3=Bush | first4=Isabelle F. | last4=Scholl | title=Measuring the Solar Radius from Space during the 2003 and 2006 Mercury Transits  | arxiv=1203.4898 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...750..135E |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/135 | volume=750 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haberreiter, Schmutz &amp; Kosovichev (2008)&lt;ref name=Hab2008&gt;{{citation | first1 = M | last1=Haberreiter | first2=W | last2=Schmutz | first3=A.G. | last3=Kosovichev | title=Solving the Discrepancy between the Seismic and Photospheric Solar Radius | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=675 | issue=1 | pages=L53-L56 | doi=10.1086/529492 | bibcode=2008ApJ...675L..53H| arxiv=0711.2392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; determined the radius corresponding to the solar photosphere to be {{Convert|695660|+/-|140|km|mi|abbr=off}}. This new value is consistent with helioseismic estimates; the same study showed that previous estimates using inflection point methods had been overestimated by approximately {{cvt|300|km|mi}}.

== Nominal solar radius ==

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] passed Resolution B3, which defined a set of nominal conversion constants for stellar and planetary [[astronomy]]. Resolution B3 defined the ''nominal solar radius'' (symbol &lt;math&gt;R^{N}_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt;) to be equal to ''exactly'' 695,700&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=IAU2015resB3&gt;{{citation | first1=E.E. | last1=Mamajek | first2=A. | last2=Prsa | first3=G. | last3=Torres | first4=al. | last4=et | title=IAU 2015 Resolution B3 on Recommended Nominal Conversion Constants for Selected Solar and Planetary Properties | arxiv=1510.07674 |bibcode = 2015arXiv151007674M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominal values were adopted to help astronomers avoid confusion when quoting stellar radii in units of the Sun's radius, even when future observations will likely refine the Sun's actual photospheric radius (which is currently only known to about the ±100–200&amp;nbsp;km accuracy).


==Examples==
Solar radii as a unit are popular when talking about spacecraft moving close to the sun. Two spacecraft in the 2010s. 

*[[Solar Orbiter]] (as close as 45 Solar radii, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)
*[[Parker Solar Probe]] (as close as 9 Solar radii, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Soluforce''' is a brandname of [[Pipelife]] for a [[Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe|Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe (RTP)]].

==Introduction==
Soluforce is an RTP, which is a flexible pipe, supplied in long length coils up to 400m length and pressure ratings from 30 to 90&amp;nbsp;bar. In the last few years, this type of pipe has been acknowledged as the standardised solution for oilfield [[flowlines]] and also recently used offshore for water injection risers and oil flowlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bert Dalmolen |title=Reinforced thermoplastic pipe: standardised composite solution for oilfield flowlines |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=October |pages=30–37 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AReinforced+thermoplastic+pipe%3A+standardised+composite+solution+for+oilfield+flowlines&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112330/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very great advantage of this pipe is also its very fast installation time compared to steel pipe as speeds up to 1000&amp;nbsp;m/h have been reached installing RTP in ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soluforce |title=Soluforce lays Sumatra pipeline in a jiffy |journal=PetroMin |year=2006 |volume= |issue=December |pages=32–34 |url=http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3ASoluforce+lays+Sumatra+pipeline+in+a+jiffy&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112344/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The pipe mainly benefits applications where steel fails due to corrosion and installation time is an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pipelife |title=Fiber Reinforced Plastic Pipe Vies With Steel |journal=Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal |year=2004 |volume= |issue=December |pages= |url=http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/December%2004/tech%20notes-12.04.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AFiber+Reinforced+Plastic+Pipe+Vies+With+Steel&amp;as_publication=Pipeline+%26+Gas+Journal&amp;as_ylo=2004&amp;as_yhi=2004&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316094122/http://www.oildompublishing.com/PGJ/pgj_archive/December%2004/tech%20notes-12.04.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside the application for oil transportation, this pipe is also applied for gas transport lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dr. Kerstin Grass, Thüga AG |title=Einsatz von faserverstärkten Rohren im Gashochdruckbereich |journal=Krv Nachrichten |year=2005 |volume=2/2005 |issue= |pages=17–20 |url=http://www.krv.de/nachrichten2-2005-internet-komplett.pdf |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AEinsatz+von+faserverst%C3%A4rkten+Rohren+im+Gashochdruckbereich&amp;as_publication=KRV+NACHRICHTEN&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2005&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012170833/http://www.krv.de/nachrichten2-2005-internet-komplett.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Education of Shelby Knox''''' is 2005 documentary film that tells the coming-of-age story of public speaker and feminist Shelby Knox,&lt;ref name ="test"&gt;[http://shelbyKnox.com/], Shelby Knox's website&lt;/ref&gt; a teenager who joins a campaign for comprehensive [[sex education]] in the high schools of [[Lubbock, Texas]]. TEOSK was an official selection of the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2005 and aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]’ ''[[P.O.V.]]'' series that same year. It was directed and produced by [[Marion Lipschutz]] and [[Rose Rosenblatt]].

== Overview ==
[[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] has some of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation, the "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

Shelby Knox is a deeply religious [[Southern Baptist]] teenager who joins the Lubbock Youth Commission, a group of high school students representing a youth voice in city government. When the teens confront Lubbock's sexual health crisis and campaign for comprehensive sex education, Knox throws herself into the battle with missionary fervor, struggling to reconcile her newfound political beliefs with her conservative religious views. When the campaign broadens to include a fight for a gay-straight alliance, Knox must confront her family and pastor in this coming-of-age story.

== Awards ==
''The Education of Shelby Knox'' has received a number of awards:
*2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]] (Excellence in Cinematography, Documentary Category)
*2005 [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] Film Festival (Audience Award)
*2005 [[Sonoma Valley Film Festival]] (Jury Prize)
*2005 Miami Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival (Jury Prize, Best Documentary)
*2005 [[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]] (Emerging Pictures Audience Award)
*[[Council on Foundations]] (2005 Henry Hampton Award for Excellence in Film &amp; Digital Media)
*2005 Fresno Reel Pride Film Festival (Audience Award, Best Feature)
*2006 The Index on Censorship's Freedom of Expression Film Award (Nominee)

== Shelby Knox in the News ==
The [[Dixie Chicks]]' 2006 album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' features a track titled "Lubbock or Leave It", which is based on ''The Education of Shelby Knox''. When the song came out, the group's member [[Emily Robison]] told the press: "We'd seen a documentary called ''The Education of Shelby Knox'', which was about a girl ... trying to get Lubbock to teach sex education in the schools. Lubbock has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs in the U.S., so it really showed what happens when you keep that information away from people." Lead singer [[Natalie Maines]], who is from Lubbock, subsequently spoke (during a 2006 episode of ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'') about watching the film and drawing from her own experiences of living there to write the song.

Shelby calls herself a feminist revolutionary. She currently works for change.org, as the director of Organizing Women’s rights. In addition, Shelby is on the advisory board of SPARK, leadership council for ITVS Women, and Girls Lead Initiative. She also is a writer on The Ms. Education of Shelby Knox blog, where she conveys her current opinions on hot topics. Shelby Knox is also on Twitter.

In the 2013 documentary [[How to Lose Your Virginity (film)|''How to Lose Your Virginity'']], scenes from ''The Education of Shelby Knox'' are featured alongside interviews with Shelby Knox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kolb | first = Leigh| title =How to Lose Your Virginty or: How We Need to Rethink Sex| publisher = Bitch Flicks| url =http://www.btchflcks.com/2013/08/how-to-lose-your-virginity-or-how-we-need-to-rethink-sex.html#.Ukow7Ba0wts| date = 9 August 2013| accessdate = 30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2011, Shelby Knox is living in New York City and serving as the Director of Organizing, Women's Rights for Change.org.

An '''ultrasonic pulse velocity test''' is an [[in-situ]], [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] test to check the quality of [[concrete]] and natural rocks. In this test, the strength and quality of concrete or rock is assessed by measuring the velocity of an [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic pulse]] passing through a concrete structure or natural rock formation. This test is conducted by passing a pulse of ultrasonic [[wave]] through concrete to be tested and measuring the time taken by pulse to get through the structure. Higher velocities indicate good quality and continuity of the material, while slower velocities may indicate concrete with many cracks or voids.

== Testing procedure ==
Ultrasonic testing equipment includes a pulse generation circuit, consisting of electronic circuit for generating pulses and a transducer for transforming electronic pulse into mechanical pulse having an oscillation frequency in range of 40&amp;nbsp;kHz to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, and a pulse reception circuit that receives the signal.&lt;ref&gt;Equipment:
*http://www.azom.com/equipment-details.aspx?EquipID=2646
*http://www.proceq.com/nondestructivetestequipment/concrete-testing/ultrasonic-pulse-velocity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The transducer, clock, oscillation circuit, and power source are assembled for use. After [[calibration]] to a standard sample of material with known properties, the transducers are placed on opposite sides of the material. Pulse velocity is measured by a simple formula:

&lt;math&gt;Pulse \;Velocity = \frac{\;Width \;of structure}{Time \;taken \;by \;pulse \;to \;go \;through}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Procedure:

== Interpretation of results ==
Quality of concrete in terms of strength, homogeneity, trapped air, internal flaws, cracks, segregation, honeycombing, compaction, workmanship, and durability can be concluded from this test. The test can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of crack repair.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt; Ultrasonic testing is an indicative and [[List of materials analysis methods|other tests]] such as [[destructive testing]] must be conducted to find the structural and mechanical properties of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Inferences:

In [[semiotics]], the '''value''' of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] depends on its position and relations in the system of signification and upon the particular [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] being used.

==Saussure's value==

[[File:Semiotic Value.GIF|thumb|left|the internal, vertical relationship between signifier and signified is distinct from the horizontal relation of values between signs.]]

Value is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms ''redouter'' ("to dread"), ''craindre'' ("to fear"), and ''avoir peur'' ("to be afraid") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its "extra something" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from.

For de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of 
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who indirectly influenced Saussure&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2869724.ece The Poet who could Smell Vowels]&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another.

Value determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, "zena" is useful because it stands in contrast to "zenb" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, "zena" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility.

It must also be noted that it is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes "thought-sound" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.

== Definitions ==
=== Saussure ===
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and 
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a ''thing'' rather than the thing itself.

This emphasises that the sign is merely a [[symbol]] for the [[class (philosophy)|class]] of [[object (philosophy)|object]] referred to. Hence, the [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word or noun "box" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or [[audience]] may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word.

However, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently ''boxy'' about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun "box"—the scope of [[onomatopoeia]] is limited when forming a [[language]]. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to [[denotation (Semiotics)|denote]] the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising "air" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water.

This makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], but one which is conditioned by [[history]] and [[culture]], i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]].

Further, [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982)  proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her [[discourse]]. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a [[cognitive]] use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values.

=== Barthes ===
Because signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of,  ''inter alios'', [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: "...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification" (1967, 9). 

In the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is ''not'' present can be just as significant as what is present.

In a slightly different context of critique through the ''archaeological'' and ''genealogical'' methods for the study of [[knowledge]], [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) used the idea of [[discontinuity (Postmodernism)|discontinuity]] as a means to ''revalorise'' elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked.

==Methods==
The [[commutation test (Semiotics)|commutation test]] can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the [[paradigms]] and [[code (Semiotics)|code]] to which the signifiers used belong.

[[Paradigmatic analysis]] compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual’s own technique, or because of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]], generic [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] and [[rhetoric]]al purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">The '''Wau Ecology Institute''' (WEI) was established in 1961 near the town of [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], in [[Morobe Province|Morobe]] province, as a field station of the [[Bishop Museum]].  In 1973 it became an independent environmental organisation.  It has laboratory space for visiting scientists, a [[herbarium]] and zoological reference collections. The Institute ceased operations around 2007 and is now run as a local coffee plantation by former employees and area gold miners.
