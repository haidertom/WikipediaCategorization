'''American College of the Building Arts''' (ACBA) is a private four-year liberal arts and sciences college located in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. It is licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to grant a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in six craft specializations in the building arts.

The college's model is unique in the United States, with its focus on total integration of a liberal arts and science education and the traditional building arts skills. Students choose from among six craft specializations: [[timber framing]], [[carpentry|architectural carpentry]], [[plaster]], [[masonry]], [[blacksmith]]ing (forged architectural iron) and [[stone carving|architectural stone carving]].

ACBA's stated mission is to educate and train [[artisan]]s in the traditional building arts in order to foster exceptional craftsmanship and encourage the preservation, enrichment and understanding of the world's architectural heritage through a liberal arts and science education.

[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior measuring for a custom stair.]]
Current students come from more than 30 states. One quarter of the student body is female and one fifth are veterans. The majority of students have secured employment in their respective trades prior to graduation, aided by expertise gained from their education and externship experiences, critical analysis and deep knowledge base in preservation, restoration and appropriate materials needed in each of their chosen fields. The [[interdisciplinary]] approach allows graduates to be as educated as the architects with whom they work.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:American-College-of-the-Building-Arts-library.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts library interior.]]American College of the Building Arts was founded in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]], which struck the Southeastern coast of the United States in 1989. The devastating category four hurricane damaged or destroyed many historical coastal-Carolina buildings and left much of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston's]] iron, plaster and fine wood work in disrepair. It took ten years to rebuild and restore the city's damaged homes and historical buildings, in part, because of a shortage of skilled artisans. In 1999, in response to this gap in the building arts, a group of local movers and shakers planted the seeds that led to the founding of ACBA.

Initially, classes and workshops that focused on the building arts were offered at a number of different Charleston area locations. However, the original educational model proved difficult to execute, and the college founders regrouped to establish a degree-granting college, integrating the American liberal arts degree model with the artisan teaching styles of Europe. In 2004, ACBA was licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to recruit students for a Bachelor of Applied Science and an Associate of Applied Science in the building arts. In 2009 the college awarded its first degrees to seven students. During these same years, ACBA reconfigured its administration, hiring current president, Lt.(ret.) General Colby M. Broadwater III and other administrative team members with strong business experience.

== Academics ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts student working with steel.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Student at the American College of the Building Arts working with steel.]]American College of the Building Arts combines a traditional liberal arts education with programs in trade education that are based on [[Europe]]an and other models. The framing and plaster programs are based on the French [[Compagnons du Tour de France|“les Compagnons du Devoir,”]] a trade guild offering high-skill vocational and educational training rich in culture and humanity. The stone program is based on programs at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and [[Wells Cathedral]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The iron program has a long association with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and also with the work of [[Philip Simmons]], famed [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] ironwork artisan and one of the founders of ACBA. Pieces designed and made by Simmons are displayed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[South Carolina State Museum]] and outside the United States in [[France]] and [[China]]. In addition to trade-specific classes, students pursue a course of general studies that includes not only typical college courses, such as English and mathematics, but also specialized courses in drawing, design, materials science and construction management. ACBA maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio to ensure the highest standards of quality in its programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/buildingartscollege/docs/acba.2013-2014.catalog.fincat.08141&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.JPG|thumb|American College of the Building Arts freshman math class.]]

The Byrne-Diderot Library is a major research resource for students and faculty. The library houses a specialized collection of books, periodicals, newspapers and audiovisual materials in the building, visual, decorative and liberal arts. The library's main collection contains over 6.500 items. The D.A.R. Special Collections room contains another 500 rare books, catalogs and periodicals, as well as examples of historical tools and 19th century Charleston iron work.

==Campus history ==
[[File:American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.jpg|thumb|American College of the Building Arts junior carving a stone mantle.]]American College of the Building Arts first classes were offered at several different locations in and around the city of Charleston, including the [[Old Charleston Jail|Old Charleston District Jail]], which became the college's primary location for 17 years. Carpentry and forged architectural iron programs were housed at a separate site. The Jail was originally constructed in 1802 and expanded in 1855 to include living quarters for the warden and jailers on the street side and an octagonal rear wing. Many infamous inmates were housed in the prison, including high seas pirates, the female mass murderer Lavinia Fischer and [[Denmark Vesey]], a free African American who plotted a slave rebellion that was discovered before it could be executed. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners were incarcerated within its walls. Although it had no electricity or running water, the jail housed prisoners until it was decommissioned in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/charleston/old.htm&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Groundbreaking with Mayor Riley.jpg|thumb|left|American College of the Building Arts ground breaking of the Old Charleston Trolley Barn on May 7, 2015.]]

During the years spent occupying and renovating the jail, the college viewed itself as caretaker of the building and its rich history. As part of ACBA's living learning laboratory, faculty members led students in assessing needs and proper methods of restoration, preservation and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/september-october/hands-on-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Having outgrown its existing facilities, ACBA launched a major fundraising effort in 2014 to establish a single, expanded campus that could consolidate the teaching of all trades under one roof. With a major donation from Parallel Capital and from Russell and Betty Joan Hitt, founders of Virginia-based HITT Contracting, early supporters of ACBA, the college raised funds to purchase and renovate the abandoned Charleston Trolley Barn on Upper Meeting Street. On May 7, 2015, 150 people attended the ground breaking ceremony.

It took just over one year and approximately $6 million to build the new state-of-the-art ACBA campus that was formally opened in October 2016. The newly repurposed building maintains the historical ethos of the original structure while providing the students with modern academic and workshop space. Approximately 39,000 square feet were carved out of the barn's original 24,000 square foot footprint. The front third of the three-story building houses an exhibition lobby, administrative offices, classrooms, labs and a community room available to local civic groups. Workshops and trade classrooms are located in the back two-thirds of the building. A student lounge, faculty offices and conference spaces occupy the second floor. The third floor rafters house the computer lab and ACBA's unique library and its special collections.  The building has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In September 2018, the College received national accreditation from the [http://www.accsc.org/ Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges].

==Additional Programs==
A diverse lineup of evening courses was introduced to the public beginning in the fall of 2017, including AutoCAD, interior design and history of Charleston architecture. In January 2018, ACBA initiated intensive one-week courses in areas such as sculptural blacksmithing, decorative woodcarving, furniture restoration, furniture design and stained glass. In the fall of 2018, the addition of an undergraduate major in classical architecture and design will bring the list of ACBA majors up to seven.

Globally, this process may be responsible for 30-50% of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas produced in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Devol A.

The bacteria that perform the anammox process belong to the bacterial phylum [[Planctomycetes]]. Currently, five anammox genera have been discovered: ''[[Brocadia anammoxidans|Brocadia]]'', ''Kuenenia'', ''Anammoxoglobus'', ''Jettenia'' (all fresh water species), and ''[[Scalindua]]'' (marine species).&lt;ref&gt;Jetten, M. S. M. et al. Biochemistry and molecular biology of anammox bacteria" ''Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'' 44(2-3), 65-84 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The anammox bacteria are characterized by several striking properties: they all possess one anammoxosome, a membrane bound compartment inside the [[cytoplasm]] which is the locus of anammox catabolism. Further, the membranes of these bacteria mainly consist of [[ladderane]] lipids so far unique in [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boumann H.

In 1932, it was reported that [[dinitrogen]] gas was generated via an unknown mechanism during [[fermentation]] in the sediments of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA.&lt;ref&gt;Allgeier, R. J. et al. The anaerobic fermentation of lake deposits. ''International Review of Hydrobiology'' 26(5-6), 444-461 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[F. A. Richards]]&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Richards. Anoxic basins and fjordsin. ''Chemical Oceanography'', J.P. Ripley and G.

The reactor used the effluent from a methanogenic pilot reactor, which contained ammonium, sulphide and other compounds, and [[nitrate]] from a nitrifying plant as the influent.

According to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N labeling experiments carried out in 1997, [[ammonium]] is biologically oxidized by [[hydroxylamine]], most likely derived from [[nitrite]], as the probable electron acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van De Graaf A.

At the same time, nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine at the cytoplasmic site of the same enzyme complex responsible for hydrazine oxidation with an internal electron transport (Figure 3a). The other mechanism postulates the following: ammonium and hydroxylamine are converted to hydrazine by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, hydrazine is oxidized in the periplasm to dinitrogen gas, and the generated electrons are transferred via an electron transport chain to nitrite reducing enzyme in the cytoplasm where nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine (Figure 3b). Whether the reduction of nitrite and the oxidation of hydrazine occur at different sites of the same enzyme or the reactions are catalyzed by different enzyme systems connected via an electron transport chain remains to be investigated.&lt;ref name="S-Q 2013"/&gt; In microbial nitrogen metabolism, the occurrence of hydrazine as an intermediate is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schalk H.

A possible role of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) or [[nitroxyl]] (HNO) in anammox was proposed by Hooper et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hooper A. B. ''et al.'' | year = 1997 | title = Enzymology of the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by bacteria | doi = 10.1023/a:1000133919203 | pmid = 9049018 | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 71 | issue = 1–2| pages = 59–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by way of condensation of NO or HNO and ammonium on an enzyme related to the ammonium monooxygenase family. The formed hydrazine or imine could subsequently be converted by the enzyme [[hydroxylamine oxidase]] to dinitrogen gas, and the reducing equivalents produced in the reaction are required to combine NO or HNO and ammonium or to reduce nitrite to NO. Environmental genomics analysis of the species ''Candidatus'' ''[[Kuenenia stuttgartiensis]]'', through a slightly different and complementary metabolism mechanism, suggested NO to be the intermediate instead of hydroxylamine (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Strous&gt;{{cite journal | author = Strous M.

In this pathway (Figure 4), there are two enzymes unique to anammox bacteria: hydrazine hydrolase (hh) and hydrazine dehydrogenase (hd). The hh produces hydrazine from nitric oxide and ammonium, and hd transfer the electrons from hydrazine to ferredoxin. Few new genes, such as some known fatty acid biosynthesis and S-adenosylmethionine radical enzyme genes, containing domains involved in electron transfer and catalysis have been detected.&lt;ref name=Strous/&gt;

==Application==
The application of the anammox process lies in the removal of [[ammonium]] in wastewater treatment and consists of two separate processes. The first step is partial [[nitrification]] (nitritation) of half of the ammonium to nitrite by [[nitrification|ammonia oxidizing bacteria]]:
:2NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The resulting ammonium and nitrite are converted in the anammox process to dinitrogen gas and circa 15% nitrate (not shown) by anammox bacteria:
:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Both processes can take place in 1 reactor where two guilds of bacteria form compact granules.&lt;ref name="pmid20448175"&gt;{{cite journal

For the enrichment of the anammox organisms a granular biomass or [[biofilm]] system seems to be especially suited in which the necessary sludge age of more than 20 days can be ensured. Possible reactors are [[sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBR), moving bed reactors or gas-lift-loop reactors. The cost reduction compared to conventional nitrogen removal is considerable; the technique is still young but proven in several fullscale installations. The first full scale reactor intended for the application of anammox bacteria was built in the Netherlands in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van der Star WRL, Abma WR, Blommers D, Mulder J-W, Tokutomi T, Strous M, Picioreanu C, Van Loosdrecht MCM | year = 2007 | title = Startup of reactors for anoxic ammonium oxidation: experiences from the first full-scale anammox reactor in Rotterdam | url = | journal = Water Res | volume = 41 | issue = 18| pages = 4149–4163 | doi=10.1016/j.watres.2007.03.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other wastewater treatment plants, such as the one in Germany (Hattingen), anammox activity is coincidentally observed though were not built for that purpose. As of 2006, there are three full scale processes in The Netherlands: one in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (in [[Rotterdam]]), and two on industrial effluent.

Conventional nitrogen removal from ammonium-rich wastewater is accomplished in two separate steps: nitrification, which is mediated by aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrification carried out by denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the input of suitable electron donors. Aeration and input of organic substrates (typically methanol) show that these two processes are: (1) highly energy consuming, (2) associated with the production of excess sludge and (3) produce significant amounts of green-house gases such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and ozone-depleting NO.&lt;ref name=Hu2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hu Z, Lotti T, Lotti T, de Kreuk M, Kleerebezem R, van Loosdrecht M, Kruit J, Jetten MSM, Kartal B | year = 2013 | title = Nitrogen removal by a nitritation-anammox bioreactor at low temperature | url = | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 79| issue = 8| pages = 2807–2812| doi = 10.1128/AEM.03987-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anaerobically, this process does not require aeration and other electron donors. Nevertheless, oxygen is still required for the production of nitrite by ammonia-oxiding bacteria. However, in partial nitritation/anammox systems, oxygen demand is greatly reduced because only half of the ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite instead of full conversion to nitrate. The autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guarantee a low yield and thus less sludge production.&lt;ref name=Hu2013/&gt; Additionally, anammox bacteria easily form stable self-aggregated biofilm (granules) allowing reliable operation of compact systems characterized by high biomass concentration and conversion rate up to 5–10&amp;nbsp;kg N m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;van Loosdrecht MCM (2008) Innovative nitrogen removal.

==Disadvantages==
The doubling time is slow, between 10 days to 2 weeks.&lt;ref name=microbewiki&gt;[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Anammox microbewiki: Anammox]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult to grow enough sludge for a wastewater treatment reactor. Also the recovery time after the loss of sludge by accident is longer than in conventional nitrogen removal systems. On the other hand this slow growing rate is an advantage due to the reduction of surplus sludge that needs to be removed and treated. Depending on the exact species, the optimum pH level is 8.&lt;ref name=microbewiki/&gt; Therefore it can be necessary to adjust the pH of the wastewater by adding caustic.

Several kinds of '''archaeological remnants of the Jerusalem Temple''' exist, both for the Temple that stood before the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Babylonia]] in 586 BCE, and for the rebuilt Temple that stood until  destruction by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in the year 70.

==First Temple==

The term [[First Temple]] is customarily used to describe the Temple of the Biblical period, which is thought to have been destroyed by the Babylonian conquest. It is described in the Bible as having been built by King [[Solomon]], and is understood to have been constructed with its [[Holy of Holies]] centered on a stone hilltop now known as the [[Foundation Stone]] which had been a traditional focus of worship in Jerusalem. 

==Archaeology==
Because of the religious and political sensitivities involved, no archaeological excavations and only limited surface surveys of the Temple Mount have been conducted since [[Charles Warren]]'s expedition of 1867–70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Warren |authorlink=Charles Warren |url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundjerus00warruoft |title=Underground Jerusalem: An Account of Some of the Principal Difficulties Encountered in Its Exploration and the Results Obtained.

* An [[ostracon]] (excavated prior to 1981), sometimes referred to as the [[House of Yahweh ostracon]], was discovered at [[Tel Arad]], dated to 6th century BCE which mentions a temple which is probably the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521227179 |page=397 |author=T. C. Mitchell |editor1=John Boardman |editor2=I. E. S. Edwards |editor3=E. Sollberger |editor4=N. G. L. Hammond |chapter=Judah Until the Fall of Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A thumb-sized [[ivory pomegranate]] (which came to light in 1979) measuring {{convert|44|mm|in}} in height, and bearing an ancient Hebrew inscription "Sacred donation for the priests in the House of ---h,]", was believed to have adorned a sceptre used by the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in Solomon's Temple. It was considered the most important item of biblical antiquities in the [[Israel Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Myre |first=Greg |date=December 30, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/30/international/middleeast/30mideast.html |title=Israel Indicts 4 in 'Brother of Jesus' Hoax and Other Forgeries |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2004, the Israel Antiquities Authority reported the inscription to be a [[forgery]], though the ivory pomegranate itself was dated to the 14th or 13th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4123595.stm |title=Ivory pomegranate 'not Solomon's{{'-}} |publisher=BBC News |date=December 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the report's claim that three incised letters in the inscription stopped short of an ancient break, as they would have if carved after the ancient break was made. Since then, it has been proven that one of the letters was indeed carved prior to the ancient break, and the status of the other two letters are in question. Some paleographers and others have continued to insist that the inscription is ancient, some dispute this so the authenticity of this writing is still the object of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |title=Fudging with Forgeries |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=November–December 2011 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=56–58 |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |issn=0098-9444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another artifact, the [[Jehoash Inscription]], which first came to notice in 2003, contains a 15-line description of King Jehoash's ninth-century BCE restoration of the Temple. Its authenticity was called into question by a report by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which said that the surface patina contained microfossils of [[foraminifera]]. As these fossils do not dissolve in water, they cannot occur in a calcium carbonate patina, leading initial investigators to conclude that the patina must be an artificial chemical mix applied to the stone by forgers.  As of late 2012, the academic community is split on whether the tablet is authentic or not. Commenting on a 2012 report by geologists arguing for the authenticity of the inscription, in October 2012, [[Hershel Shanks]] (who believes the inscription is genuine) wrote the current situation was that most Hebrew language scholars believe that the inscription is a forgery and geologists that it is genuine, and thus "Because we rely on experts, and because there is an apparently irresolvable conflict of experts in this case, [[Biblical Archaeology Review|BAR]] has taken no position with respect to the authenticity of the Jehoash Inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |title=Authentic or Forged?

* By 2006, the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]] had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from soil removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the [[Solomon's Stables]] area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period [[bulla (seal)|bulla]], or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name ''Netanyahu ben Yaush.'' Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the [[Lachish letters]]. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1350 |title=Building Remains From The Time Of The First Temple Were Exposed West Of The Temple Mount |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |date=March 13, 2008 |quote=a personal Hebrew seal made of a semi-precious stone that was apparently inlaid in a ring. The scarab-like seal is elliptical and measures c. {{convert|1.1|cm|1|abbr=on}} x {{convert|1.4|cm|1|abbr=on}}. The surface of the seal is divided into three strips separated by a double line: in the upper strip is a chain decoration in which there are four pomegranates and in the two bottom strips is the name of the owner of the seal, engraved in ancient Hebrew script. It reads: לנתניהו בן יאש ([belonging] to Netanyahu ben Yaush). The two names are known in the treasury of biblical names: the name נתניהו (Netanyahu) is mentioned a number of times in the Bible (in the Book of Jeremiah and in Chronicles) and the name יאש (Yaush) appears in the Lachish letters. The name Yaush, like the name יאשיהו (Yoshiyahu) is, in the opinion of Professor Shmuel Ahituv, derived from the root או"ש which means “he gave a present” (based on Arabic and Ugaritic). It is customary to assume that the owners of personal seals were people that held senior governmental positions. It should nevertheless be emphasized that this combination of names – נתניהו בן יאוש (Netanyahu ben Yaush) – was unknown until now. |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shragai |first=Nadav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=776621 |title=Temple Mount dirt uncovers First Temple artifacts |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, artifacts dating to the 8th to 6th centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org.il/news40.html |title=Temple Mount First Temple Period Discoveries |publisher=The Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Milstein |first=Mati |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/10/071023-jerusalem-artifacts.html |title=Solomon's Temple Artifacts Found by Muslim Workers |work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]] |date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving evidence of the Second Temple==

The term "[[Second Temple]]" describes the temple described in the Bible as having been built after the accession of [[Cyrus the Great]] to the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.&lt;ref name="Albright 1963"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last = Albright|first = William|authorlink = William F.

Consecrated in 516 BCE&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology/&gt; by the [[Babylonian captivity|exiles]] returning from [[Babylon]] under [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]], it is contained within a far grander edifice. This edifice of the ancient Temple Mount was expanded at least twice more, once under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] and then under [[Herod the Great]], who turned it into one of the largest built structures in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology&gt;''The Archaeology of the Holy Land: From the Destruction of Solomon's Temple to the Muslim Conquest,'' [[Jodi Magness]], Cambridge University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|1139510207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit square Temple platform toward the south; distinctive Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian expansion===

The massive Herodian expansion produced the Temple of Jesus' time.

====Inscriptions====

The [[Trumpeting Place inscription]] and the [[Temple Warning inscription]] are surviving pieces of the Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount. Both inscribed stones are on display in the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology in the Israel Museum," eds. Michal Dayagi-Mendels, Silvia Rosenberg, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2010, p. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription.jpg|thumb|Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription]]
During Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of [[Tumah|purity laws]]. Those who were not of the Jewish nation were prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple. A hewn stone measuring 60 x 90&amp;nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:
:ΜΗΟΕΝΑΑΛΛΟΓΕΝΗΕΙΣΠΟ
:ΡΕΥΕΣΟΑΙΕΝΤΟΣΤΟΥΠΕ
:ΡΙΤΟΙΕΡΟΝΤΡΥΦΑΚΤΟΥΚΑΙ
:ΠΕΡΙΒΟΛΟΥΟΣΔΑΝΛΗ
:ΦΘΗΕΑΥΤΩΙΑΙΤΙΟΣΕΣ
:ΤΑΙΔΙΑΤΟΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥ
:ΘΕΙΝΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ
Translation: "Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death." Today, the stone is preserved in [[Museum of Antiquities, Istanbul|Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities]].

====Walls====

Enormous Herodian lower courses of the massive northern, [[Eastern Wall|Eastern]], [[Southern Wall|Southern]] and [[Western Wall]]s survive.

====Structures beneath the Temple platform====

[[Solomon's Stables]] is a name given in later centuries to an enormous, underground vaulted support structure erected by Herodian engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Soucek, "The Temple of Solomon in Islamic Legend and Art." In ''The Temple of Solomon: Archaeological Fact and Medieval Tradition in Christian, Islamic and Jewish Art''. Edited by Joseph Gutmann. Missoula, MT: Scholars Press,1976, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paving stones====

Swaths of Herodian paving survive ''in situ'' on the Temple Mount is several places.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Structures of undetermined antiquity==

The [[Well of Souls]] beneath the Foundation Stone, understood to be extremely ancient, has never been opened to examination by archaeologists by the [[waqf]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">Chemical Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) is a [[bioassay]] used in the detection of specific chemicals in samples. It consists of a modified cell line that has a [[DNA construct]] with a [[luciferase]] [[reporter gene]] in conjunction with [[response elements]] that can induce [[Transcription_(genetics)|transcription]] of the inserted [[gene]] for the light-generating enzyme. The response elements can be varied in order to provide binding sites for other receptors that relate to a chemical of interest that is wished to be detected. The CALUX bioassay has thus been redesigned to detect certain chemicals of interest. Most applications have been oriented in detecting environmentally harmful chemicals like [[environmental hormones]].

CALUX is an effect based screening method as it measures the total effect [[ligands]] (from a sample) have on a receptor. Unlike [[chemical analysis]], CALUX is thus able to measure all activity on the receptor of interest. This also includes unidentified [[Congener_(chemistry)|congeners]] of certain ligands.

==Applications==
Dioxin Responsive (DR)CALUX is a bioassay used in the detection of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds]]. It is based on the mechanisms of the [[AhR]]-pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murk,|first=A.J. |author2=J. Legler |author3=M.S. Denison |author4=J.P. Giesy |author5=C. van de Guchte |author6=A. Brouwer |title=Chemical-Activated Luciferase Gene Expression (CALUX): A Novel in-Vitro Bioassay for Ah Receptor Active Compounds in Sediments and Pore Water|journal=Fundamental and Applied Toxicology|date=1 September 1996|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–160|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272059096901529|accessdate=28 March 2014|doi=10.1006/faat.1996.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chronic activation of the AhR-pathway by these compounds has been shown to cause cancer in the predominantly the liver and can cause developmental defects in [[vertebrates]]. DR CALUX is used by companies that want to screen for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in order to guarantee [[food safety]] of their products. Dioxins are considered to be the most toxic man-made chemical.

Caribmap is created and directed by a scientist, [[S. Blair Hedges]], who is responsible for managing all content.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt; It has received large donations of map images from public and private institutions such as the [[Branner Earth Sciences Library|Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp; Map Collections]] of [[Stanford University]], the [[Norman B. Leventhal Map Center]] at the [[Boston Public Library]], the [[Perry–Castañeda Library|Perry-Castañeda Library]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] of the [[University of Florida]].

== Contents ==

Caribmap encompasses the geographic range of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its islands, including those bordering the Middle and South American mainland, such as the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] of [[Honduras]], [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] ([[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]]), [[Trinidad]], and [[Tobago]]. The [[Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] are also incorporated due to their cultural, economic, and historic links to the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

The site features scans of high-resolution maps, organized by islands, which allow the capability to zoom in on details of historic or scientific importance. Map thumbnail images pertaining to that island are sorted in chronological order by the year the map was made, above the viewing area. Bibliographic information (title, year, maker, medium, size, and credit) is displayed under each map. The site also has a feature called “map tours,” focused on individual islands (currently only Jamaica), which are short videos featuring historical maps and 3D scenes from [[Google Earth]]. One demonstrated use of Caribmap, given its large number of high-resolution map images, has been quantitative historical analysis, which traces the use of [[toponymy|toponyms]] (place names) through time.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

In [[music]], a '''chromatic fourth''', or '''''passus duriusculus''''',&lt;ref name="Monelle"&gt;Monelle, Raymond (2000). ''The Sense of Music: Semiotic Essays'', p.73. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05716-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[melody]] or melodic fragment spanning a [[perfect fourth]] with all or almost all [[chromatic]] [[Interval (music)|interval]]s filled in ([[chromatic line]]). The quintessential example is in [[D minor]] with the tonic and dominant notes as boundaries, {{audio|Chrom4th Example.mid|Play}}:

[[File:Chrom4th Example.png]]

The chromatic fourth was first used in the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s of the 16th Century.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Latin term itself—"harsh" or "difficult" (''duriusculus'') "step" or "passage" (''passus'')—originates in [[Christoph Bernhard]]'s 17th century ''Tractatus compositionis augmentatus'' (1648–49), where it appears to refer to repeated melodic motion by semitone creating consecutive semitones.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; The term may also relate to the ''[[pianto]]'' associated with weeping.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; In the Baroque, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used it in his choral as well as his instrumental music, in the ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', for example (the chromatic fourth is indicated by a red bracket), {{audio|Bach Example wHiLite.mid|Play}}:

[[File:Bach Example wHiLite.png|400px]]

In operas of the Baroque and Classical, the chromatic fourth was often used in the bass and for woeful arias, often being called a "[[lament bass]]". In the penultimate pages of the first movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], the  chromatic fourth appears in the cellos and basses.

[[File:Vivaldi lament bass from RV 631, Aria No. 2.png|thumb|center|400px|Lament bass from [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s motet ''"O qui coeli terraeque serenitas"'' [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 631, Aria No. 2&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Peter (1998).

This does not mean that the chromatic fourth was always used in a sorrowful or foreboding way, or that the boundaries should always be the tonic and dominant notes. One counterexample comes from the Minuet of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Mozart)|String Quartet in G major]], [[Köchel number|K.]] 387 (the chromatic fourths are conveniently bracketed by the slurs and set apart with note-to-note dynamics changes), {{audio|K387m2 IVln.mid|Play}}:

In the field of psychology, '''cognitive dissonance''' is the [[Stress (psychological)|mental discomfort]] (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory [[belief]]s, [[idea]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]. This discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person’s belief clashes with new evidence perceived by that person. When confronted with facts that contradict personal beliefs, ideals, and values, people will find a way to resolve the contradiction in order to reduce their discomfort.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93–107 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;

== Relations among cognitions ==
To function in the [[reality]] of a modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt;
# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)
# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, and wearing a shirt)
# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)

=== Magnitude of dissonance ===
The reduction of the [[psychological stress]] of cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance caused by the existential inconsistency, between two contradictory beliefs held by the person; or by the contradiction between the person's beliefs and an action he or she has taken.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:
# The importance of cognitions: The greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation.
# Ratio of cognitions: The proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements.

== Reduction==
Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their personal expectations of life and the existential [[reality]] of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.

The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen his or her mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realised either by changing with or by justifying against, or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1957"/&gt; In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:
# Change the behavior or the cognition ("I'll eat no more of this doughnut.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.")
# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new cognitions ("I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.")
# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.")

Three cognitive biases in particular are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is "better, kinder, smarter, more moral, and nicer than average," and [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51-53 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Likewise, the study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking tobacco.

# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)
# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)
#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)

To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

# Functional beliefs ("Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset."; "Smoking helps me concentrate better."; "Smoking is an important part of my life."; and "Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.")
# Risk-minimizing beliefs ("The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated."; "One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?"; and "Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.")&lt;ref&gt;Fotuhi, Omid, et al.  Tobacco control (2012): tobaccocontrol-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradigms==
There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, or [[Value (ethics)|values]]; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.

===Belief disconfirmation===
The disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction; seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs; or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, Eddie, "A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion", in ''The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice'', James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications, p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Kracht|Kracht, C.]], &amp; [[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], [http://www.wehrhahn-verlag.de/index.php?section=abisz&amp;subsection=details&amp;id=577 ''Five Years, Vol. 1''] ([[Hannover]]: [[:de:Wehrhahn Verlag|Wehrhahn Verlag]], 2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early hypothesis of belief disconfirmation presented in ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'' (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S. ''When Prophecy Fails'' (1956). Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference'' (2008) reported the belief disconfirmation occurred to the ''[[Chabad]]'' Orthodox Jewish congregation who believed that their [[Rebbe]] (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) was the Messiah. Yet, when he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregants proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that [[Chabad messianism#The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death|Schneerson was the Messiah]], and that he would soon return from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, David (2008). ''The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference''. Portland: Litman Library of Jewish Civilization.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced compliance===
{{see also|Forced compliance theory}}
In the ''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'' (1959), the investigators Festinger and [[Merrill Carlsmith]] asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.

[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|After performing dissonant behavior ([[lie|lying]]) a person might find external, consonant elements. Therefore, a [[snake oil]] salesman might find a psychological self-justification (great profit) for promoting medical falsehoods, but, otherwise, might need to change his beliefs about the falsehoods.]]

At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: "I told someone that the task was interesting" and "I actually found it boring." Moreover, the subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the "interesting task" mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the "interesting task" mental attitude and, thus, experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1959 | title = Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0041593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Forbidden Behaviour paradigm
In the ''Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior'' (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by [[Elliot Aronson]] and Carlsmith, examined [[self-justification]] in children.&lt;ref name="aronson1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Carlsmith | first2 = J.M. | year = 1963 | title = Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 584–588 | doi = 10.1037/h0039901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, children were left in a room with a variety of toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy; and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).&lt;ref name= "aronson1963"/&gt;

Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.&lt;ref name=aronson1963 /&gt;

In ''The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance'' (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name=MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00694|title=The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=2|year=2012|last1=Masataka|first1=Nobuo|last2=Perlovsky|first2=Leonid |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00694.pdf}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="MasatakaPerlovsky_MusicReducesCognitiveDissonance"/&gt;

Moreover, music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, ''Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance'' (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee |first1=Spike W. S. |last2=Schwarz |first2=Norbert |title=Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance|journal=Science|date=May 2010|volume=328|doi=10.1126/science.1186799 |pmid=20448177 |issue=5979 |pages=709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free choice===
In the study ''Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives'' (1956) 225 female students rated a series of domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of a second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brehm | first1 = J. | year = 1956 | title = Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives | doi = 10.1037/h0041006 | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 384–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of cognitive dissonance occurs to a person faced with making a difficult decision, wherein there always exist aspects of the rejected-object not chosen, which appeal to the person making the choice. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; thus, the decision "I chose X" is dissonant with the cognition that "There are some aspects of Y that I like." Moreover, the study ''Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys'' (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.&lt;ref name="Egan et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | last3 = Santos | first3 = L.R. | year = 2010 | title = Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.08.014 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 204–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?'' (2013) indicated that, in addition to internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts individually. That social preferences and social norms are related, and function in line with wage-giving among three persons. The actions of the first person influenced{{clarify|date=October 2015}} the wage-giving actions of the second person. That inequity aversion is the paramount concern of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jeea.12015|pmid=28553193|title=Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|volume=11|issue=3|pages=548–573|year=2013|last1=Gächter|first1=Simon|last2=Nosenzo|first2=Daniele|last3=Sefton|first3=Martin|ssrn=2010940}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effort justification===
{{further|Effort justification}}
Cognitive dissonance occurs to a person when he or she voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In ''The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group'' (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.

Both groups then were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronson | first1 = E. | last2 = Mills | first2 = J. | year = 1956 | title = The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group | url = http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 177–181 | doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in ''Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing'' (2006), the results indicated that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S.W.S. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5979/709 | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5979| page = 709 | doi=10.1126/science.1186799 | pmid=20448177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Liljenquist | first2 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing | doi = 10.1126/science.1130726 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5792| pages = 1451–1452 | pmid=16960010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise, the study ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.

The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on his or her attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jarcho, J. M., Berkman, E. T., &amp; Lieberman, M. D. (2011). “The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making”, ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'', 6(4), 460–467. doi:10.1093/scan/nsq054

=== Unpleasant medical screenings ===
In the study ''Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings '' (2016), the researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the "human respiratory virus-27". The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, "We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ent|first=Michael R.|last2=Gerend|first2=Mary A.|date=September 2016|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=21|issue=9|pages=2075–2084|doi=10.1177/1359105315570986|issn=1461-7277|pmid=27535832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related phenomena ===
Cognitive dissonance may also occur when people seek to:
* Explain inexplicable feelings: When an earthquake disaster occurs to a community, irrational rumors, based upon fear, quickly reach the adjoining communities unaffected by the disaster because those people, not in physical danger, psychologically justify their anxieties about the earthquake.&lt;ref name="Prasad1950"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prasad | first1 = J. | year = 1950 | title = A Comparative Study of Rumours and Reports in Earthquakes | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1950.tb00271.x | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 3–4| pages = 129–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimisation (psychology)|Minimize]] regret of irrevocable choices: At a hippodrome, bettors have more confidence after betting on horses they chose just before the post-time because this confidence prevents a change of heart; the bettors felt post-decision cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Knox&amp;Inkster1968"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0025528 |title=Postdecision Dissonance at Post Time |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=8|issue=4, Pt.1 |pages=319–323 |year=1968 |last1=Knox |first1=Robert E. |last2=Inkster |first2=James A. |url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Knox-Inkster-Postdecision-dissonance-at-post-time.pdf |pmid=5645589 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021123811/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Knox-Inkster-Postdecision-dissonance-at-post-time.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications==
=== Education ===
The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the [[motivation]] of a student to pursue education.&lt;ref name="Aronson1995"&gt;Aronson, E. (1995).'' The Social Animal'' (1995), New York: W.H. Freeman and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children’s Intrinsic Motivation'' (1975) indicated that the application of the [[effort justification]] paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.&lt;ref name="LepperandGreene1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lepper | first1 = M.

The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students’ [[self-awareness]] of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[values]] and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the  students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the [[psychological stress]] of the conflict between reality and the student's value system.&lt;ref name="GuzzettiSnyderGlassandGamas1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guzzetti | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Snyder | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Glass | first3 = G.V. | last4 = Gamas | first4 = W.S. | year = 1993 | title = Promoting Conceptual Change in Science: A Comparative Meta-analysis of Instructional Interventions from Reading Education and Science Education | journal = Reading Research Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 116–159 | jstor=747886 | doi=10.2307/747886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[educational software]] that applies the derived principles facilitates the students’ ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject.&lt;ref name="GraesserBaggettandWilliams1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graesser | first1 = A.

=== Psychotherapy ===
The general effectiveness of [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychological intervention]] is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Cooper2007"&gt;Cooper, J. (2007). Cognitive Dissonance: 50 Years of a Classic Theory. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, [[social psychology]] proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific [[therapy]] and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="CooperAxsom1982"&gt;Cooper, J., &amp; Axsom, D. (1982). Integration of Clinical and Social Psychology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study ''Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children'' (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.&lt;ref name="MendoncaBrehm1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mendonca | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = S.

In the study ''Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction '' (1980), people afflicted with [[ophidiophobia]] (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their [[phobia]].&lt;ref name="Cooper1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = J. | year = 1980 | title = Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(80)90064-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 452–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the results of ''Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss'' (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying his or her efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient's perceptions.&lt;ref name="AxsomCooper1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axsom | first1 = D. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(85)90012-5 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 149–160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social behavior ===
Cognitive dissonance is used to promote positive social behaviours, such as increased [[condom]] use;&lt;ref name="StoneAronsonCrainWinslowFried1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = J. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = E. | last3 = Crain | first3 = A.

Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred.  Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group will develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).

=== Consumer behavior&lt;!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --&gt; ===
Three  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer. The consumer is free to select from the alternatives, and the decision to buy is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gbadamosi|first=Ayantunji|title=Cognitive Dissonance: The Implicit Explication in Low-income Consumers' Shopping Behaviour for "Low-involvement" Grocery Products|journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|date=January 2009|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1077–1095|doi= 10.1108/09590550911005038|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices '' (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii)  Engage in [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullikin|first=Lindsey J|title=Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers' Encounters with Unexpected Prices|journal=Journal of Products &amp; Brand Management|year=2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=140–153|doi=10.1108/10610420310476906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cognitive-dissonance-politics-prabhakar-mundkur/|title=Is there Cognitive Dissonance in Politics?|date=2016-07-11|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.

This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Ryan K.|last2=Joslyn|first2=Mark R.|date=2001-09-01|title=Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Attitude Change in Six Presidential Elections|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0162-895X.00252/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–540|doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00252|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What wasn't studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. Since the U.S. 2016 election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html|title=Poll: Trump, Clinton score historic unfavorable ratings|last=CNN|first=David Wright,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it might be a good case study to examine the cognitive dissonance effects in these instances.

=== Self-perception theory===
In ''The Gestalt Theory of Motivation'' (1960), the social psychologist [[Daryl Bem]] proposed the [[self-perception theory]] whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"&gt;Heider, F. (1960). The Gestalt Theory of Motivation. Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 8, pp. 145–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1965 | title = An Experimental Analysis of Self-persuasion|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 199–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1967 | title = Self-perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena | url = http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 183–200 | doi=10.1037/h0024835 | pmid=5342882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant [[arousal]], of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zanna | first1 = M. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1974 | title = Dissonance and the Pill: An Attribution Approach to Studying the Arousal Properties of Dissonance | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1974-32359-001 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 703–709 | doi=10.1037/h0036651| pmid = 4833431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiesler | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pallak | first2 = M.S. | year = 1976 | title = Arousal Properties of Dissonance Manipulations | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1977-21057-001 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 83 | issue = 6| pages = 1014–1025 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1014| pmid = 996211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective'' (1969), [[Elliot Aronson]] linked cognitive dissonance to the [[self-concept]]: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions "I am an honest person." and "I lied about finding the task interesting."&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 1969 pp. 1–34"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60075-1|chapter=The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=1–34|year=1969|last1=Aronson|first1=Elliot|isbn=9780120152049|publisher=Academic Press|editor-first1=Leonard |editor-last1=Berkowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle?'' (1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects his or her public [[self-image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedeschi | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Schlenker | first2 = B.R. | last3 = Bonoma | first3 = T.V. | year = 1971 | title = Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 685–695 | doi = 10.1037/h0032110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the results reported in the study ''I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors'' (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppin | first1 = G. | last2 = Delplanque | first2 = S. | last3 = Cayeux | first3 = I. | last4 = Porcherot | first4 = C. | last5 = Sander | first5 = D. | year = 2010 | title = I'm No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 489–493 | pmid = 20424088 | doi=10.1177/0956797610364115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance theory===
{{main|Balance theory}}
[[Fritz Heider]] proposed a motivational theory of attitude change that functions on the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance.  This drive is known as the consistency motive—the urge to maintain one's values and beliefs over time.
According to balance theory there are three things interacting: (1) you (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X).  These are each positioned at one point of a triangle and share two relations:&lt;ref name="Heider, F. 1960"/&gt;
# ''Unit relations'' – things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc.
# ''Sentiment relations'' – evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking)

As people, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among three positions; 3 positives or 2 negatives, 1 positive:
 P = you
 O = John
 X = John's dog
::"I don't like John"
::"John has a dog"
::"I don't like the dog either"

People also avoid unbalanced states of relations; 3 negatives or 2 positives, 1 negative)
 P = you
 O = your child
 X = picture your child drew
::"I love my child"
::"She drew me this picture"
::"I love this picture"

===Cost–benefit analysis===
In the study ''On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works'' (1969), [[Jules Dupuit]] reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic processing of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, J. (1969). “On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works”, ''Readings in Welfare''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-discrepancy theory===

[[E. Tory Higgins]] proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:

# ''Actual self'' – representation of the attributes the person believes him- or herself to possess (basic self-concept)
# ''Ideal self'' – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
# ''Ought self'' – ideal attributes the person believes he or she should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce [[self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] (the gap between two self-guides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3615707|year=1987|author1=Higgins|first1=E.

===Averse consequences vs. inconsistency===
During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60121-5|chapter=A New Look at Dissonance Theory|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|volume=17|pages=229–266|year=1984|last1=Cooper|first1=Joel|last2=Fazio|first2=Russell H.|isbn=9780120152179|editor-first=Leonard|editor-last= Berkowitz|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they feel they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Brehm | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Simon | first4 = L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = D.E. | year = 1996 | title = Evidence that the production of aversive consequences is not necessary to create cognitive dissonance | url = http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal96.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 5–16 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the free-choice paradigm===
In the study ''How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm'' (2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Risen | first2 = J.L. | year = 2010 | title = How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm | doi = 10.1037/a0020217 | pmid = 20658837 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 573–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.

Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. ''Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence'', 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00983.x|title=Do Choices Affect Preferences?

===Action–motivation model===
The action–motivation model proposes that inconsistencies in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency interferes with the person's functioning in the [[Reality|real world]]. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.

The occurrence of cognitive dissonance produces a state of [[affect (psychology)|negative affect]], which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behaviour, in order to resolve the psychologic inconsistency that caused the mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;(Beckmann and Kuhl, 1984, Harmon-Jones, 1999, Harmon-Jones, 2000a, Jones and Gerard, 1967, McGregor et al., 1999 and Newby-Clark ''et al.'', 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As the afflicted person works towards a behavioural commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left [[frontal cortex]] of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = J | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = J | year = 1984 | title = Altering Information to Gain Action Control: Functional Aspects of Human Information Processing in Decision Making | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(84)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., 1999. “Toward an Understanding of the Motivation Underlying Dissonance Processes: Is Feeling Personally Responsible for the Production of Aversive Consequences Necessary to Cause Dissonance Effects?” in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Perspectives on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology''.

E., Gerard, H. B., 1967. Foundations of Social Psychology. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, I., Newby-Clark, I. R., Zanna, M. P., 1999. “Epistemic Discomfort is Moderated by Simultaneous Accessibility of Inconsistent Elements”, in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Progress on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology'', Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, pp. 325–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive dissonance model===
The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the [[predictive coding]] (or predictive processing) model of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaaronen | first1 = R.O. | year = 2018 | title = A Theory of Predictive Dissonance: Predictive Processing Presents a New Take on Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02218/full | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 9| issue = | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1177/01461672002612004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming [[proprioception|proprioceptive]], [[interoception|interoceptive]] and [[exteroception|exteroceptive]] sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine which attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizable conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.

== Neuroscience findings ==
=== Visualisation ===
The study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance'' (2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Veen | first1 = V. | last2 = Krug | first2 = M.K. | last3 = Schooler | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Carter | first4 = C.S. | year = 2009 | title = Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210_Neural_Activity_Predicts_Attitude_Change_in_Cognitive_Dissonance/file/3deec51b8bf291652a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1469–1474 | doi=10.1038/nn.2413| pmid = 19759538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the anterior [[insular cortex]]; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.&lt;ref name="psych.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|400px|The biomechanics of cognitive dissonance: MRI evidence indicates that the greater the psychological conflict signalled by the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the greater the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance experienced by the person.]]

As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study ''How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome'' (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the [[striatum]] changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T. | last2 = De Martino | first2 = B. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.J. | year = 2009 | title = How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome | url = http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 3760–3765 | doi = 10.1523/jneurosci.4972-08.2009 | pmid = 19321772 | pmc = 2675705 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053852/http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~tsharot/Sharot_JofN_2009.pdf | archivedate = 2011-06-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies such as ''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010)&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarcho|first1=Johanna M.|last2=Berkman|first2=Elliot T.|last3=Lieberman|first3=Matthew D.|title=The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making|journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience|year=2010|doi=10.1093/scan/nsq054|pmid=20621961|volume=6|issue=4|pages=460–467|pmc=3150852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification'' (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref name="Izuma et al."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qin | first1 = J. | last2 = Kimel | first2 = S. | last3 = Kitayama | first3 = S. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Yang | first5 = X. | last6 = Han | first6 = S. | year = 2011 | title = How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.076 | pmid = 21130888 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 240–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making'' (2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-[[inferior frontal gyrus]], in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the [[ventral striatum]], and that neural activity decreased in the [[anterior insula]].&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt; That the neural activities of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.&lt;ref name=JarchoEtAl_NeuralBasisRationalization /&gt;

=== Emotional correlations ===
The results reported in ''Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity'' (2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the [[Frontal cortex|left frontal cortex]], a brain structure also associated with the emotion of [[anger]]; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, 1999 and 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a directional model of [[Motivation|Approach motivation]], the study ''Anger and the Behavioural Approach System'' (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, he or she is without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 1999. pp. 71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2003 | title = Anger and the Behavioural Approach System | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 995–1005 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(02)00313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E | year = 2004 | title = Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 67| issue = 1–2| pages = 51–76 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.003 | pmid = 15130525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amodio | first1 = D.M | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E | last3 = Devine | first3 = P.G | last4 = Curtin | first4 = J.J | last5 = Hartley | first5 = S | year = 2004 | title = A Covert Neural signals for the control of unintentional race bias | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 88–93 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502003.x| pmid = 14738514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beauvois, J. L., Joule, R. V., 1996. A radical dissonance theory. London: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychology of mental stress ===
The results reported in ''The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys'' (2007) indicated that there might be [[Evolution|evolutionary force]] behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and [[Capuchin monkey]]s when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egan | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Santos | first2 = L.R. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys | url = http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Egan%20Santos%20Bloom%20-%20origins%20cog%20diss%20-%20Psy%20Sci%202007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 11| pages = 978–983 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02012.x| pmid = 17958712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of ''An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes'' (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked [[psychological stress]] when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmon-Jones|first=E|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=C|last3=Levy|first3=N|date=2015|title=An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes|doi=10.1177/0963721414566449|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=3|pages=184–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study ''Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude'' (2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of [[Envy]] (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person's [[self-concept]] was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class [[snobbery]]. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and ''Schadenfreude'' (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the [[insular lobe]], and with increased activity in the [[Striatum|striate nucleus]]; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of [[empathy]] (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jankowski|first=K|last2=Takahashi|first2=H|date=2014|title=Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude|journal=Psychiatry &amp; Clinical Neurosciences|volume=68|issue=5|pages=319–336|doi=10.1111/pcn.12182|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260947954_Cognitive_neuroscience_of_social_emotions_and_implications_for_psychopathology_Examining_embarrassment_guilt_envy_and_schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling in neural networks ==

{{Group intelligence}}
'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}.

===Thomas Reid and the Scottish school===
[[File:ThomasReid.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Reid, founder of the Scottish school of Common Sense.]]
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Computational representational understanding of mind''' ('''CRUM''') is a [[hypothesis]] in [[cognitive science]] which proposes that thinking is performed by [[computations]] operating on representations. This hypothesis assumes that the mind has [[Mental representation|mental representations]] analogous to [[data structures]] and computational procedures analogous to [[algorithms]], such that computer programs using algorithms applied to data structures can model the mind and its processes.

CRUM takes into consideration several theoretical approaches of understanding human [[cognition]], including [[logic]], [[:wikt:rule|rule]], [[concept]], [[analogy]], image, and connection based systems. These serve as the representation aspects of CRUM theory which are then acted upon to simulate certain aspects of human cognition, such as the use of [[rule-based systems]] in [[neuroeconomics]]. 

There is much disagreement on this hypothesis, but CRUM has high regard among some researchers {{citation needed|reason=Need link to sources|date=April 2016}}.

'''Decision field theory''' ('''DFT''') is a dynamic-cognitive approach to human decision making. It is a [[cognitive model]] that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a [[rational]] or [[normative theory]] that prescribes what people should or ought to do. It is also a [[dynamic model]] of [[decision making]] rather than a static model, because it describes how a person's preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference. The preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a [[diffusion process]]. It is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty, how decisions change under time pressure, and how choice context changes preferences. This model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or [[Mental chronometry|response times]].

The paper "Decision Field Theory" was published by [[Jerome Busemeyer|Jerome R. Busemeyer]] and [[James Townsend (psychologist)|James T. Townsend]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Busemeyer, J.

==Introduction==
The name ''decision field theory'' was chosen to reflect the fact that the inspiration for this theory comes from an earlier approach - avoidance conflict model contained in [[Kurt Lewin]]'s general psychological theory, which he called ''field'' theory. DFT is a member of a general class of sequential sampling models that are commonly used in a variety of fields in cognition.&lt;ref name=ashby2000&gt;Ashby, F. G. (2000). A stochastic version of general recognition theory. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44, 310–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997&gt;Nosofsky, R. M., &amp; Palmeri, T. J. (1997).

The basic ideas underlying the decision process for sequential sampling models is illustrated in Figure 1 below. Suppose the decision maker is initially presented with a choice between three risky prospects, A, B, C, at time t = 0. The horizontal axis on the figure represents deliberation time (in seconds), and the vertical axis represents preference strength. Each trajectory in the figure represents the preference state for one of the risky prospects at each moment in time.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;[[File:SamplePathsDiffusionProcess.jpg|frame|center|Figure 1 — Sample paths for a diffusion process]]

Intuitively, at each moment in time, the decision maker thinks about various payoffs of each prospect, which produces an affective reaction, or valence, to each prospect. These valences are integrated across time to produce the preference state at each moment. In this example, during the early stages of processing (between 200 and 300 ms), attention is focused on advantages favoring prospect C, but later (after 600 ms) attention is shifted toward advantages favoring prospect A. The stopping rule for this process is controlled by a threshold (which is set equal to 1.0 in this example): the first prospect to reach the top threshold is accepted, which in this case is prospect A after about two seconds. Choice probability is determined by the first option to win the race and cross the upper threshold, and decision time is equal to the deliberation time required by one of the prospects to reach this threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The threshold is an important parameter for controlling speed–accuracy tradeoffs. If the threshold is set to a lower value (about .30) in Figure 1, then prospect C would be chosen instead of prospect A (and done so earlier). Thus decisions can reverse under time pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, A. (2003). MDFT account of decision making under time pressure. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 10(1), 157–166.&lt;/ref&gt; High thresholds require a strong preference state to be reached, which allows more information about the prospects to be sampled, prolonging the deliberation process, and increasing accuracy. Low thresholds allow a weak preference state to determine the decision, which cuts off sampling information about the prospects, shortening the deliberation process, and decreasing accuracy. Under high time pressure, decision makers must choose a low threshold; but under low time pressure, a higher threshold can be used to increase accuracy. Very careful and deliberative decision makers tend to use a high threshold, and impulsive and careless decision makers use a low threshold.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;
To provide a bit more formal description of the theory, assume that the decision maker has a choice among three actions, and also suppose for simplicity that there are only four possible final outcomes. Thus each action is defined by a probability distribution across these four outcomes. The affective values produced by each payoff are represented by the values m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. At any moment in time, the decision maker anticipates the payoff of each action, which produces a momentary evaluation, U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for action i. This momentary evaluation is an attention-weighted average of the affective evaluation of each payoff: U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = Σ W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t)m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. The attention weight at time t, W&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;(t), for payoff j offered by action i, is assumed to fluctuate according to a stationary stochastic process. This reflects the idea that attention is shifting from moment to moment, causing changes in the anticipated payoff of each action across time. The momentary evaluation of each action is compared with other actions to form a valence for each action at each moment, v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t) – U.(t), where U.(t) equals the average across all the momentary actions. The valence represents the momentary advantage or disadvantage of each action. The total valence balances out to zero so that all the options cannot become attractive simultaneously. Finally, the valences are the inputs to a dynamic system that integrates the valences over time to generate the output preference states. The output preference state for action i at time t is symbolized as P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t). The dynamic system is described by the following linear stochastic difference equation for a small time step h in the deliberation process: P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h) = Σ s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(t)+v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t+h).The positive self feedback coefficient, s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; = s &gt; 0, controls the memory for past input valences for a preference state. Values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1 suggest decay in the memory or impact of previous valences over time, whereas values of s&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 suggest growth in impact over time (primacy effects). The negative lateral feedback coefficients, s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = s&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 for i not equal to j, produce competition among actions so that the strong inhibit the weak. In other words, as preference for one action grows stronger, then this moderates the preference for other actions. The magnitudes of the lateral inhibitory coefficients are assumed to be an increasing function of the similarity between choice options. These lateral inhibitory coefficients are important for explaining context effects on preference described later. Formally, this is a Markov process; matrix formulas have been mathematically derived for computing the choice probabilities and distribution of choice response times.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

The decision field theory can also be seen as a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics.&lt;ref name=Microprocess/&gt;

==Explaining context effects==
The DFT is capable of explaining context effects that many decision making theories are unable to explain.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, R. M., Busemeyer, J. R., &amp; Townsend, J. T. (2001). Multi-alternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision-making. Psychological Review, 108, 370–392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many classic probabilistic models of choice satisfy two rational types of choice principles. One principle is called [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and according to this principle, if the probability of choosing option X is greater than option Y when only X,Y are available, then option X should remain more likely to be chosen over Y even when a new option Z is added to the choice set. In other words, adding an option should not change the preference relation between the original pair of options. A second principle is called regularity, and according to this principle, the probability of choosing option X from a set containing only X and Y should be greater than or equal to the probability of choosing option X from a larger set containing options X, Y, and a new option Z. In other words, adding an option should only decrease the probability of choosing one of the original pair of options. However, empirical findings obtained by consumer researchers studying human choice behavior have found systematic context effects that systematically violate both of these principles.

The first context effect is the similarity effect. This effect occurs with the introduction of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half with the introduction of S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X.

The second context effect is the compromise effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added that is a compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus is added to the choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes the compromise between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X.

The third effect is called the attraction effect. This effect occurs when the third option D is very similar to X but D is defective compared to X. For example D may be a new sporty car developed by a new manufacturer that is similar to option X = BMW, but costs more than the BMW. Therefore, there is little or no reason to choose D over X, and in this situation D is rarely ever chosen over X. However, adding D to a choice set boosts the probability of choosing X. In particular, the probability of choosing X from a set containing X,Y,D is larger than the probability of choosing X from a set containing only X and Y. The defective option D makes X shine, and this attraction effect violates the principle of regularity, which says that adding another option cannot increase the popularity of an option over the original subset.

DFT accounts for all three effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention switching process is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction about the effects of time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see Roe et al.2001). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects &lt;ref&gt;Pettibone, J. C. (2012). Testing the effect of time pressure on asymmetric dominance and compromise decoys in choice. Judgment and Decision Making, 7(4), 513-523.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, I. (1989). Choice based on reasons: The case of attraction and compromise effects. Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 158–174.&lt;/ref&gt; and time pressure decreases the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Dhar, R., Nowlis, S. M., &amp; Sherman, S. J. (2000). Trying hard or hardly trying: An analysis of context effects in choice. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, 189–200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
The Decision Field Theory has demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioral decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviorally-derived diffusion models of decision making.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b"&gt;Busemeyer, J. R., R. K. Jessup, Joseph G. Johnson, James T. Townsend. (2006). [http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbusemey/NeuralNet.pdf Building bridges between neural models and complex decision making behavior]. Neural Networks 19(8): 1047-1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision processes of sensory-motor decisions are beginning to be fairly well understood both at the behavioral and neural levels. Typical findings indicate that neural activation regarding stimulus movement information is accumulated across time up to a threshold, and a behavioral response is made as soon as the activation in the recorded area exceeds the threshold&lt;ref&gt;Schall, J. D. (2003). Neural correlates of decision processes: neural and mental chronometry. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 13(2), 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, J. I., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2000). Representation of a perceptual decision in developing oculomotor commands. Nature, 404(6776), 390–394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazurek, M. E., Roitman, J. D., Ditterich, J., &amp; Shadlen, M. N. (2003). A role for neural integrators in perceptual decision making. Cerebral Cortex, 13(11), 1257–1269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, R., Cherian, A., &amp; Segraves, M. (2003). A comparison of macaque behavior and superior colliculus neuronal activity to predictions from models of two-choice decisions. Journal of Neurophysiology, 90(3), 1392–1407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shadlen, M. N., &amp; Newsome, W. T. (2001). Neural basis of a perceptual decision in the parietal cortex (area LIP) of the rhesus monkey. Journal of Neurophysiology, 86(4), 1916–1936.&lt;/ref&gt; for examples). A conclusion that one can draw is that the neural areas responsible for planning or carrying out certain actions are also responsible for deciding the action to carry out, a decidedly embodied notion.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

Mathematically, the spike activation pattern, as well as the choice and response time distributions, can be well described by what are known as diffusion models - especially in [[Two-alternative forced choice]] tasks(see Smith &amp; Ratcliff&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. L., &amp; Ratcliff, R. (2004). Psychology and neurobiology of simple decisions. Trends in Neurosciences, 27(3), 161–168.&lt;/ref&gt; for a summary). Diffusion models, such as the decision field theory, can be viewed as stochastic recurrent neural network models, except that the dynamics are approximated by linear systems. The linear approximation is important for maintaining a mathematically tractable analysis of systems perturbed by noisy inputs. In addition to these neuroscience applications, diffusion models (or their discrete time, random walk, analogues) have been used by cognitive scientists to model performance in a variety of tasks ranging from sensory detection,&lt;ref name=smith1995/&gt; and perceptual discrimination,&lt;ref name=laming1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=link1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=usher2001/&gt; to memory recognition,&lt;ref name=ratcliff1978/&gt; and categorization.&lt;ref name=ashby2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=nosofsky1997/&gt; Thus, diffusion models provide the potential to form a theoretical bridge between neural models of sensory-motor tasks and behavioral models of complex-cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="busemeyer2006b" /&gt;

'''Schluckbildchen'''; from [[Germany|German]], which means literally "swallowable pictures", are small notes of paper that have a [[sacred]] image on them with the purpose of being swallowed. They were used as a religious practice in the [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] throughout the eighteenth to twentieth century, and were believed to possess curative powers. Frequently found in the "spiritual [[medicine chest|medicine chests"]] of devout believers at that time, by swallowing them they wished to gain these curative powers. They are to be distinguished from ''Esszettel''; from [[Germany|German]], meaning "edible notes of paper", the latter only having text written on them.

==Variations==

===''Esszettel''===
''Esszettel'' had either [[adage]]s, names of [[saint]]s, [[prayer]]s or [[bible]] verses written on them, usually in the shortened form of [[sigil (magic)|sigils]]. Occasionally, red paper was used. In [[Holstein]], for example, feverish people were given slips saying ''„Fieber bleib aus / [[Nomen nescio|N.N.]] ist nicht zu Haus“'' (fever stay away, N.N. is not at home). In Protestant regions like [[Württemberg]], [[East Frisia]], [[Oldenburg]] or [[Hamburg]], people symbolically consumed their own illness by eating a paper note that had their name, date of birth or some kind of phrase written on it. The slip was then stuck into a piece of bread or fruit, and the sick person ate it.&lt;ref name="richter-43"&gt;Richter, Sp. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwritten or printed ''Esszettel''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheintaler.ch/lokales/rheintal/rt-or/Hilfreiche-Fresszettel-im-Ortsmuseum;art164,1271328 „Fresszettel“ im Ortsmuseum Rüthi-Büchel, St. Gallen, Schweiz]&lt;/ref&gt; were even used to cure animals, from  illnesses like rage disease or numbness (also called ''Fresszettel''). The [[Sator square]] was thought to help against [[Rabies]]. In the [[Upper Bavaria]]n region of ''Isarwinkel'' farmers treated their livestock with ''Esszettel'' to cure [[anthrax]].

Unfortunately, there are not many remains of such ''Esszettel'' today, one of the reasons lying in the fact that the church institutions had mostly seen ''Esszettel'' as pure [[superstition]]. Hints as to how they looked like can be found in literature, where triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' are mentioned, those not only with the purpose of being swallowed, though. The triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' had words or phrases printed on them that were repeated over and over, losing one or two letters with each repetition. That way, the sick person wished to overcome the illness bit by bit.&lt;ref name="richter-43" /&gt;

''Esszettel'' that have survived to the present day are usually remains of mass-produced stock which were sold on [[pilgrimage]] markets. These types of ''Esszettel'' were printed on stamp-like sheets of paper. They were either labeled identically or varied in a certain pattern. The latter version was called ''Lukaszettel'', and one of the printing plates used to print ''Lukaszettel'' has been preserved. Sometimes, ''Esszettel'' were printed on both sides, the back page complementing the front page. These are considered to be the oldest types of ''Esszettel''.

===''Schluckbildchen''===

''Schluckbildchen'' had a square, rectangular or round shape and a feed size of 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm. So they were the smallest form of devotional art design. Small pictures of the 19th century were partly bigger, like the version that was produced in [[Einsiedeln]] (32x22 mm). 
Also ''Schluckbildchen'' were produced on light sheets of paper; one sheet could hold 130 pieces. Both possible were series of one theme as well as different themes which would always have the same style.
''Schluckbildchen'' can be detected after the [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Franz: ''Die kirchlichen Benediktionen im Mittelalter.'' Bd. 2, S. 454, Anm. 2. Freiburg/Br. 1909. Zitiert in Christoph Kürzeder: ''Als die Dinge heilig waren. Gelebte Frömmigkeit im Zeitalter des Barock.'' S. 130. Schnell &amp; Steiner, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-7954-1769-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 19th century [[copper engraving printings]] were most likely, including some notes (for example in [[Mariazell]]) which were produced with a [[woodcarving technique]]. Later, [[colour printing]] was used; in the 20th century also [[photomechanical]] reproduction of old artworks.

''Schluckbildchen'' often show the [[Virgin Mary]] as a [[picture of mercy]] in a specific [[pilgrimage location]], sometimes other saints or portrayals from Christian iconography, like the [[Nomen sacrum]] or [[Titulus INRI]]. Usually, under the theme an inscription is placed naming the location of pilgrimage or the saint that is portrayed. Frequently, someone made the effort also to put on details of the devotional art design. The symmetry of the rectangular, triangular, diamond-shaped, round or elliptical-shaped frame elements concentrated the effect of the picture on the central theme. Also effects like rays of light as well as the floating on clouds put emphasise on the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] character of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Schneegass, S. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producer and sales==

''Esszettel'' were sold not only by merchants in pilgrimage locations, but also by [[charlatan]]s. It is passed on that a charlatan was travelling through Saxony in 1898, who gave ''Sympathiezettelchen'' (litaeral translation: sympathy notes) that were written in unreadable words, for an optional prize from 0.30 up to one Deutsche Mark to ill people to eat. ''Esszettel'' were also prescribed by a Saxon quack in 1913, known under the name “the Reinsdorf miner”.

In former times, ''Schluckbildchen'' were sold in all pilgrimage locations. Producers were (among others):
*F. Gutwein, Augsburg
*[[Johann Michael Söckler|J. M. Söckler]], Munich
*F. Pischel, Linz
*Jos. Nowohradsky, Graz
*Frères [[Benziger]], Einsiedeln.

''Brandzettel'' (literal translation: notes of fire), which were used for the recovery of animals, were available at [[Franciscan]] in [[Tölz]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' were from time to time a flourishing business of some monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Margarete Ruff: ''Zauberpraktiken als Lebenshilfe: Magie im Alltag vom Mittelalter bis heute,'' S. 154. Campus, Frankfurt/Main 2003, {{ISBN|3-593-37380-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the seventies in the 19th century, “Schluckbildchen” were still sold in Mariazell, [[Naples]], and [[Sata Maria del Carmine]] in [[Florence]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' of [[Our Dear Virgin of Everlasting Aid]] were sold from Rome to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Sp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnologist Dominik Wunderlin, department manager at the [[Museum der Kulturen Basel]], reported in 2005 that a woman`s monastery in Bavaria, which was not named in that connection, was still giving away ''Schluckbildchen'' at the entrance gate.&lt;ref&gt;Dominik Wunderlin: [http://www.hauszumdolder.ch/referat_d_wunderlin/ Volksfrömmigkeit in der Vergangenheit. Exemplarisch dargestellt an Objekten der Sammlung Dr. Edmund Müller]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
As the terms ''Schluckbildchen'' and ''Esszettel'' suggest, their main medical purpose was of spiritual nature, also called “gratia medicinalis” during the [[Baroque]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Brückner: ''Eßzettel.'' In ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;3, Sp.&amp;nbsp;894. Herder, Freiburg 1993, {{ISBN|3-451-22003-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''paper pills'' were either soaked in water, dissolved or added to dishes, in order to then be swallowed by the sick person. The ingestion of little pictures can be seen as a primitive and unmediated form of taking possession of the embodiment of the saint's curative power (or whoever was depicted). Both the ritual effort that was made to grasp the true meaning of the cult image, but also the memory of the pilgrimage adventure the sick person associated with the ''Schluckbildchen'', increased the miraculous effect. That held true despite the fact that many ''Schluckbildchen'' were hard to decipher and written in poor Latin. What remains unclear until today is the question, whether or not the consumption of ''Schluckbildchen'' was in any way connected to the practices of the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Sacramental bread]].

In rarer cases, ''Schluckbildchen'' were used as letters of protection or as religious [[amulet]]s common at that time (e.g. [[Wettersegen]] or [[Breverl]]). Furthermore, they were used as decorations for gingerbread and other pastries.

If nothing else was at hand, even holy images used in [[Anglican devotions|devotions]] were swallowed; either as a whole or torn apart and soaked in water. Lastly, it was quite common to eat images taken from [[calendar of saints|Calendars of saints]].

''Schluckbildchen'' were used in either practices of [[organized religion]] and [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenz Kriss-Rettenbeck: ''Bilder und Zeichen religiösen Volksglaubens.'' S. 45. [[Callwey Verlag]], München 1963&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 1903, the Roman [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] announced that as long as there were no superstitious practices involved, the use of ''Esszettel'' was officially granted.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Schmidt: ''Frömmigkeit auf Abwegen'' (=Morus-Kleinschriften, Nr. 32), S. 7. Morus-Verlag, Berlin 1955. Zitiert bei Richter, Sp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eduard Stemplinger]] on the other hand, on July 29 the same congregation had already decided that swallowing water-soaked paper notes with Madonna images printed on them in order to heal illnesses certainly did not count as  superstition.&lt;ref name="stemplinger"&gt;Eduard Stemplinger: ''Antike und moderne Volksmedizin'' (= Das Erbe der Alten 2; 10), S. 65. Dieterich, Leipzig 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resembling objects==

''Esszettel'' were known as ''Fieberzettel'' (literal translation: fever notes) already in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Carolingian [[Indiculus superstitionum]], there was talk about a consumption of an image of deity which was baked in bread. In late Roman medicine the ash of burnt papyrus sheets („charta combusta“) was used as an ingredient for ointment and for orally and rectally applied medicine. Those notes were supposed to have a healing effect both labelled and unlabelled.

Resembling qualities to the ''Esszettel'' also has “fever altar bread” which was given away by the [[minorities]] in the end of the 18th century. [[Wafe]] was also used as healing medicine in the turn of the 15th century as it was described in the poem ''Bluemen der tugent'' by the Tyrolese Hans Vintler: ''„Vil di wellen auf oblat schreiben / und das Fieber damit vertreiben“.''

Further examples are the [[grated clay Madonna]] , which were common up to the 20th century, and from which you grated the surface to eat. For the same purpose water was used, with which relics and resembling objects were cleaned.&lt;ref name="stemplinger" /&gt; Also the “protecting notes”, which were known in the [[Thirty Years` War]] as [[art from Passau]], were also swallowed while facilitating ritual rules.

[[A printing plate]], which was found in the second decade of the 19th century in Eastern [[Mongolia]], proves that also in that culture “eating notes” were used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walther Heissig]]: ''Heilung durch Zettelschlucken.'' In Walther Heissig, Claudius C. Müller (Hrsg.): ''Die Mongolen.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;2. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck 1989, {{ISBN|3-7016-2297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small squares from approx. 34x29 mm the printing plate contains several Tibetan spells that enclose also the connected purpose. Apparently, it originated from Tibetan [[Lamaistic]] folk medicine and was probably used by a Lamaistic migrant medical practitioner. Depending on the indication those notes had several instructions for use, e.g. “Eat when having flu” or “Eat nine when having stomach ache”.

From [[Uganda]] it is known that in the end of the 1990s followers of a famous Christian [[charismatic]] preacher and magic healer soaked his photographs in water and drank from it in order to swallow up parts of his healing power.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Behrend: ''Photo Magic: Photographs in Practices of Healing and Harming in East Africa.'' Journal of Religion in Africa 33, 22 (August 2003): 129–145, {{ISSN|0022-4200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence and causes==

Researcher Vicky Williamson at Goldsmiths, University of London, found in an uncontrolled study that earworms correlated with music exposure, but could also be triggered by experiences that trigger the memory of a song ([[involuntary memory]]) such as seeing a word that reminds one of the song, hearing a few notes from the song, or feeling an emotion one associates with the song.  The list of songs collected in the study showed no particular pattern, other than popularity.&lt;ref name="theworld" /&gt;

According to research by James Kellaris, 98% of individuals experience earworms. Women and men experience the phenomenon equally often, but earworms tend to last longer for women and irritate them more.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2901/why-do-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head|work=The Straight Dope|title=Why do songs get stuck in your head?|date=October 16, 2009|first=Cecil|last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kellaris produced statistics suggesting that songs with lyrics may account for 73.7% of earworms, whereas instrumental music may cause only 7.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/kellaris.htm|title=Songs That Cause The Brain To 'Itch': UC Professor Investigating Why Certain Tunes Get Stuck In Our Heads|last1=Hoffman|first1=Carey|date=2001-04-04|publisher=University of Cincinnati|accessdate=2012-08-06|quote=Of the 1,000 respondents, the kind of music respondents said they got stuck on most recently were songs with lyrics for 73.7 percent, jingles or ads for 18.6 percent and an instrumental tune for 7.7 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, published data in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'' directly addressed the subject, and its results support earlier claims that earworms are usually 15 to 30 seconds in length and are more common in those with an interest in music.&lt;ref name=beaman/&gt;

==Cures==
Scientists at [[Western Washington University]] found that engaging [[working memory]] in moderately difficult tasks (such as [[anagram]]s, [[Sudoku]] puzzles, or reading a novel) was an effective way of stopping earworms and of reducing their recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9950143/Get-that-tune-out-of-your-head-scientists-find-how-to-get-rid-of-earworms.html|title=Get that tune out of your head – scientists find how to get rid of earworms|last=Gray|first=Richard|date=24 March 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298444/Got-song-stuck-head-Solving-anagram-help-rid-it.html Got a song stuck in your head?

Research reported in 2015 by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the [[University of Reading]] demonstrated that [[chewing gum]] could help by similarly blocking the sub-vocal rehearsal component of auditory short-term or "working" memory associated with generating and manipulating auditory and musical images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR631000.aspx "Listen up – new research shows chewing gum could remove that stuck record in your head"], University of Reading, 22 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
[[Jean Harris]], who murdered [[Herman Tarnower]], was obsessed with the song "[[Put the Blame on Mame]]", which she first heard in the film ''[[Gilda]]''. She would [[Intrusive thoughts|recall this regularly]] for over 33 years and could hold a conversation while playing it in her mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jean Harris' Obsessive Film Song Recall|first=Cora L.|last=Díaz de Chumaceiro|url=http://www.psyartjournal.com/article/show/de_chumaceiro-jean_harris_obsessive_film_song_recall|journal=PsyArt|date=October 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
&lt;!-- Please only include examples where an earworm is a significant part of the work, not merely an reference. Include a reference to a reliable source that indicates its significance. --&gt;

[[Mark Twain]]'s 1876 story "[[A Literary Nightmare]]" (also known as "Punch, Brothers, Punch") is about a [[jingle]] that one can get rid of only by transferring it to another person.

In 1943 [[Henry Kuttner]] published the short story "[[Nothing but Gingerbread Left]]" about a song engineered to damage the Nazi war effort, culminating in [[Adolf Hitler]] being unable to continue a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|title=Nothing But Gingerbread Left|last=Kuttner|first=Henry|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223346/http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|archive-date=14 March 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 October 2017}} ''Full text of story''&lt;/ref&gt;

A short story, "Pie and Punch and You-Know-Whats" in [[Robert McCloskey]]'s 1951 [[Homer Price]] collection "Centerburg Tales" features a earworm from a jukebox that nearly infects the whole town.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/Earworms|title=Zhurnaly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alfred Bester]]'s 1953 novel ''[[The Demolished Man]]'', the protagonist uses a jingle specifically crafted to be a catchy, irritating nuisance as a tool to block mind readers from reading his mind.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1957 science fiction short story "[[The Ultimate Melody]]", a scientist, Gilbert Lister, develops the ultimate melody – one that so compels the brain that its listener becomes completely and forever enraptured by it. As the storyteller, Harry Purvis, explains, Lister theorized that a great melody "made its impression on the mind because it fitted in with the fundamental electrical rhythms going on in the brain." Lister attempts to abstract from the hit tunes of the day to a melody that fits in so well with the electrical rhythms that it dominates them completely. He succeeds and is found in a catatonic state from which he never awakens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://deoxy.org/alephnull/melody.htm|title=The Ultimate Melody by Arthur C. Clarke|work=The Web site of aleph|first=Michael|last=Chorost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Hugo Award]]-nominated short story "Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee" (1959), the title describes a rhythmic drumbeat so powerful that it rapidly spreads to all areas of human culture, until a counter-rhythm is developed that acts as an antidote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JATrt8qhXqIC&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Wavewatcher's Companion|first=Gavin|last=Pretor-Pinney|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7475-8976-1|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]'s 1988 book ''[[Touching the Void (book)|Touching the Void]]'', he talks about not being able to get the tune "[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]" by [[Boney M]] out of his head. The book tells of his survival, against the odds, after a mountaineering accident in the remote [[Siula Grande]] region of South America. Alone, badly injured, and in a semi-delirious state, he is confused as to whether he is imagining the music or really hearing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson |first=Joe|title=Touching the Void|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode 20 of [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes#Season 7: 2009–2011|season 7]] of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', entitled "Ear Worm" (2010), SpongeBob gets a song stuck in his head called "Musical Doodle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spongebob.nick.com/videos/clip/sponge-bob-ear-worm-clip-1.html|title=Ear Worm: Musical Doodle|publisher=Nick.com|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode refers to the earworm as a physical creature that enters one's head upon one's listening to a catchy song.

In the ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode titled "Head Band", a contagious group of [[virus]]es force their host to sing what they are saying to the same "boy band" tune. The only way to be cured of the Boy Band Virus is for the viruses to break up and start their own solo careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tv.com/shows/dexters-laboratory/head-band-stuffed-animal-house-used-ink-1591794/|title = Dexter's Laboratory: Head Band / Stuffed Animal House / Used Ink|date = |accessdate = 29 May 2014|website = TV.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. B. White]]'s 1933 [[Satire|satirical]] short story "The Supremacy of Uruguay" (reprinted in ''[[Timeless Stories for Today and Tomorrow]]'') relates a fictional episode in the history of Uruguay where a powerful earworm is discovered in a popular American song. The Uruguayan military builds a squadron of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless aircraft]] armed with [[phonograph]]s playing a highly amplified recording of the earworm, and conquers the entire world by reducing the citizens of all nations to mindless insanity. "[T]he peoples were hopelessly mad, ravaged by an ineradicable noise ... No one could hear anything except the noise in his own head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armandobronca.com/the-supremacy-of-uruguay_95|title=The Supremacy of Uruguay|publisher=www.armandobronca.com|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' titled "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]", Sheldon obsesses about a tune stuck in his head. He eventually figures out that it is [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|"Darlin'"]] by [[The Beach Boys]].

The [[Wise Guys (band)|Wise Guys]], a German pop band/a cappella group, created a song called Ohrwurm&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheDani708|title=wiseguys-Ohrwurm-lyrics|date=2012-03-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4rTYWjQkNU|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tells a story about a man with a song stuck in his head that he can't get out and is designed to give you an earworm.

The '''ecological humanities''' (also '''environmental humanities''') is an interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the [[humanities]] over the past several decades (in particular environmental literature, environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, L., 2018. Environmental humanities and climate change: understanding humans geologically and other life forms ethically. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 9(1), p.e499.&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[ecological]] humanities aim to help  bridge traditional divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing the natural world and the place of humans in it (Rose 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-April-2004/rose.html|title=Rose and Robin, "The Ecological Humanities in Action: An Invitation"|last=Rose|first=Deborah Bird|date=|website=www.australianhumanitiesreview.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The ecological humanities are characterised by a ''connectivity ontology'' and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Connectivity ontology==
One of the fundamental [[Ontology|ontological]] presuppositions of ecological humanities is that the [[Organic compounds|organic]] world and its [[Inorganic compounds|inorganic]] parts are seen as a single system whereby each part is linked to each other part. This [[world view]] in turn shares an intimate connection with [[Lotka]]'s physiological philosophy and the associated concept of the "World Engine".{{ref|Kingsland1985}} When we see everything as connected, then the traditional questions of the humanities concerning economic and political justice become ''enlarged,'' into a consideration of how [[justice]] is connected with our transformation of our [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[ecosystems]]. The consequence of such a connectivity [[ontology]] is, as proponents of the ecological humanities argue, that we begin to seek out a more inclusive concept of justice that includes non-humans within the domain of those to whom rights are owing. This broadened conception of justice involves "enlarged" or "ecological thinking", which presupposes the enhancement of knowledge sharing within fields of plural and diverse ‘knowledges’. This kind of knowledge sharing is called transdisciplinarity. It has links with the political philosophy of [[Hannah Arendt]] and the works of [[Italo Calvino]]. As Calvino put it, "enlarge[s] the sphere of what we can imagine". It also has connections with Leibniz's Enlightenment project where, the sciences are simultaneously abridged while also being enlarged.{{ref|Rutherford2002}}

The situation is complicated however by the recognition of the fact that connections are both ''non-linear'' and ''linear''. The ecological humanities therefore, require both linear and non-linear modes of language through which reasoning about justice can be done. Thus there is a motivation to find linguistic modes which can adequately express both linear and non-linear connectivities.

==Axioms==

There are three [[axioms]] of ecological humanities:

# The axiom of submission to [[ecological energetics|ecosystem laws]];
# The axiom of ecological kinship, which situates humanity as participant in a larger living system; and 
# The axiom of the social construction of ecosystems and ecological unity, which states that ecosystems and nature may be merely convenient conceptual entities (Marshall, 2002).

Putting the first and second axioms another way, the connections between and among living things are the basis for how ecosystems are understood to work, and thus constitute laws of existence and guidelines for behaviour (Rose 2004)

The first of these axioms has a tradition in social sciences (''see'' Marx, 1968: 3). From the second axiom the notions of "[[Embodied energy|ecological embodiment/ embeddedness]]" and "habitat" have emerged from Political Theory with a fundamental connectivity to rights, democracy and ecologism (Eckersley 1996: 222, 225; Eckersley 1998).

The third axiom comes from the strong 'self-reflective' tradition of all 'humanities' scholarship and it encourages ecological humanities to investigate its own theoretical basis (and without which, ecological humanities is just 'ecology').

==Contemporary ideas==

===Political economic ecology===
{{See also|Political ecology}}

Some theorists have suggested that the inclusion of non-humans in the consideration of justice links ecocentric philosophy with political economics. This is because the theorising of justice is a central activity of political economic philosophy. If in accordance with the axioms of ecological humanities, theories of justice are enlarged to include ecological values then the necessary result is the synthesis of the concerns of ecology with that of political economy: i.e. Political Economic Ecology.

===Energy systems language===
The question of what language can best depict the linear and non-linear causal connections of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]] appears to have been taken up by the school of ecology known as [[systems ecology]]. To depict the linear and non-linear internal relatedness of ecosystems where the laws of thermodynamics hold significant consequences (Hannon et al. 1991: 80), Systems Ecologist H.T. Odum (1994) predicated the [[Energy Systems Language]] on the principles of [[ecological energetics]]. In ecological energetics, just as in ecological humanities, the causal bond between connections is considered an ontic category (see Patten et al. 1976: 460). Moreover, as a result of simulating ecological systems with the energy systems language H.T.Odum make the controversial suggestion that embodied energy could be understood as [[emergy|value]], which in itself is a step into the field of Political Economic Ecology noted above.

'''FSU Young Scholars Program (YSP)''' is a six-week residential [[science]] and [[mathematics]] summer program for 40 [[Florida]] [[Secondary education in the United States|high school students]] with significant potential for careers in the fields of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]]. The program was developed in 1983 and is currently administered by the Office of Science Teaching Activities in the [[Florida State University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Florida State University]].

==Academic program==
Each young scholar attends a total of three courses in the fields of mathematics, science, and computer programming. The courses are designed specifically for this program—they are neither high school nor college courses.

==Research==
Each student who attends YSP is assigned an Independent Research Project (IRP) based on his or her interests. Students join the research teams of [[Florida State University|FSU]] professors, participating in [[scientific research]] for two days each week.  The fields of study available range from [[robotics]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[physics]], to [[zoology]]. At the conclusion of the program, students present their projects in an [[academic conference]], documenting their findings and explaining their projects to both students and faculty.

==Faculty==
The program is co-directed by Dr. Erica Staehling, Barbara Shoplock, and Teresa Callahan, members of the Office of Science Teaching Activities, [[Florida State University]]. Instructional faculty includes Dr. Steve Blumsack, Emeritus Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Dr. Dan Oberlin, Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Drs. Harrison Prosper and Horst Wahl, Professors of [[Physics]]; and Dr. Lloyd Epstein, Professor of [[biology|Biological Science]]. Twenty additional Florida State science and engineering faculty members mentor the students in their independent research projects.

==Selection process==
YSP admits students who have completed the eleventh grade in a Florida [[public high school|public]] or [[private high school]].  A few exceptionally qualified and mature tenth graders have been selected in past years, though this is quite rare.

All applicants must have completed [[Pre-Calculus]] and maintain at least a 3.0 unweighted [[Grading (education)|GPA]] to be considered for acceptance. Additionally, students must have scored at the 90th percentile or better in science or mathematics on a nationally standardized exam, such as the [[SAT]], [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], or [[PLAN (test)|PLAN]].  Students are required to submit an application package, including [[Transcript (education)|high school transcripts]] and a letter of recommendation.

Selection is extremely competitive, as there are typically over 200 highly qualified applicants competing for only 40 positions.  The majority of past participants graduated in the top ten of their respective high school classes, with over 25% of students entering their senior year ranked first in their class.  The average [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] score of past young scholars was in the 97th percentile in math and 94th percentile in critical reading nationally.

The '''Feminist Library''' was founded as the Women’s Research and Resources Centre in 1975 by a group of women concerned about the future of the [[Women's Library|Fawcett Library]] to ensure that the history of the [[women's liberation movement]] survived. The founders included feminist academics like [[Diana Leonard]] and [[Leonore Davidoff]].&lt;ref name="Diana Leonard obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/09/diana-leonard-obituary | title=Diana Leonard obituary | publisher=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | date=9 December 2010 | accessdate=22 November 2014 | author=David, Miriam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonore Davidoff obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/06/leonore-davidoff | title=Leonore Davidoff obituary | publisher=The Guardian www.theguardian.com | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=22 November 2014 | author=John, Angela V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The library started out as a small collection of contemporary material, but is now considered to be the most significant library of feminist material in England, containing some 7500 books, of which around 5000 are non-fiction, 500 poetry publications, and 1500 periodical titles, many self-published, spanning over about 85 metres of shelving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministlibrary.co.uk/about-the-library/ |title=About the library |publisher=The Feminist Library |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729083116/http://feministlibrary.co.uk/about-the-library/ |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large number of pamphlets, currently held at the [[Bishopsgate Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1474 |title=Feminist Library Pamphlet Collection |publisher=Bishopsgate Institute |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154253/http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1474 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 crisis===
The library faced a financial crisis in 2003 when Lambeth Council dramatically increased the rent on the building housing the collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2007/02/your_feminist_l.php |title=Your Feminist Library Needs You! |publisher=Londonist |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, in 2007, the management committee called an emergency meeting as a final attempt to gather support. Fortunately, the meeting was well attended and the library was saved, although it still struggles today, depending on grants to survive. 

===Librarians for Tomorrow===
In January 2010, the library announced that it had received a grant from Awards for All,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womeninlondon.org.uk/2010/01/training-feminist-library/ |title=Radical Librarianship Training |publisher=Womeninlondon.org.uk |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203104423/http://www.womeninlondon.org.uk/2010/01/training-feminist-library/ |archivedate=2010-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it intended to use to train volunteers in radical librarianship, using the library itself as a resource. In March 2010, fifteen volunteers were chosen from many applicants and they began working at the library in April 2010. One of the trainees began writing an anonymous blog about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com/ |title=Adventures of a Radical Feminist Librarian |publisher=Radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718104301/http://radicalfeministlibrarian.wordpress.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further updates===
Opening hours had increased in 2013 - 2014 but remained dependent on the availability of volunteers. In 2015 the Library celebrated its 40th anniversary, while by 2018 it was open afternoons or evenings from Tuesday to Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministlibrary.co.uk/  The Feminist Library: Archiving our herstories since 1975] ''feministlibrary.co.uk'', accessed 31 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==High ratio of fiction to non-fiction==
The amount of poetry and fiction in the library is unusual for a special collection focused on a political movement. The reason for this is that the library wanted to ensure individual women were represented as part of their liberation, as explained by Gail Chester, a member of the library's management committee, in an interview with Anne Welsh in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Added by My Heroines on November 8, 2008 at 11:26pm |url=http://www.hagsharlotsheroines.com/xn/detail/2391451:Note:732 |title=From Herstory to Ourstory: the Feminist Library |publisher=Hagsharlotsheroines.com |date=2008-11-08 |first2=Anne |last2=Welsh |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307180051/http://www.hagsharlotsheroines.com/xn/detail/2391451%3ANote%3A732 |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fidelity''' when personified in Western art stands for the secular aspect of Faith, or the trust that exists between a master and servant, or in family relationships.  [[Fidelity]] is often represented as a woman, shown holding a golden seal and a key, but may also be represented by a dog. Fidelity may be shown alone, or may be accompanied by a dog, a symbol of not only faithfulness but also fidelity.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, James. Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art. Rev. ed. United States of America: Westview Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, [[Penelope]] or [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]] might also stand for fidelity. Fidelity is not in the usual lists of the [[seven virtues]], though it may sometimes be included in such groupings. The plant myrtle (''[[Myrtus]]'') has been associated with fidelity, and hence used in weddings, from Roman times to the present, and wreathed crowns of myrtle may be found in art.

== Fidelity in allegory ==
A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of fidelity personified.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; The deep origins of this can also be recognized in the generic name ''Fido'' given to dogs, which originated from the Latin word ''fidus,'' meaning "trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the faithful dog of Titus Labienus, that would not quit his master's corpse, recorded in [[Pliny's Natural History]] book viii, was briefly recounted in [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' (1593, etc.) in the explanation of the emblem of ''Fedeltà'' represented as a woman holding a ring and accompanied by a white dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asim.it/iconologia/ICONOLOGIAview.asp?Id=97 Ripa, ''Iconologia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity in portraiture ==
When in a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. When the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's "[[Arnolfini Portrait]]."

== Fidelity and Death ==
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crusaders|crusader]] lying in full armor on his tomb-chest, with a dog beneath his feet is a familiar trope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11485">[[File:String technique twinkle star.png|thumb|350px|right|Hypothetical [[cello]] fingering of "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]" with [[Position (string technique)|hand positions]] with ordinals, fingers with numbers, and strings indicated with [[Roman numerals]]. The A could instead have been played [[Stopped note|open]] like the D and the entire line could have been in 1st position.]]

In [[music]], '''fingering''', or on stringed instruments '''stopping''', is the choice of which [[finger]]s and hand [[Position (string technique)|positions]] to use when playing certain [[musical instrument]]s.  Fingering typically changes throughout a [[piece (music)|piece]]; the challenge of choosing good fingering for a piece is to make the hand movements as comfortable as possible without changing hand position too often. A fingering can be the result of the working process of the [[composer]], who puts it into the manuscript, an [[editor]], who adds it into the printed score, or the [[performer]], who puts his or her own fingering in the score or in performance.

A '''substitute fingering''' is an alternative to the indicated fingering, not to be confused with [[finger substitution]]. Depending on the instrument, not all the fingers may be used. For example, saxophonists do not use the right thumb and string instruments (usually) only use the fingers.

==Instruments==

===Brass instruments===
Fingering applies to the [[Rotary valve#Use in brass instruments|rotary]] and [[Piston valve#Brass instruments|piston valves]] employed on many brass instruments.

The [[trombone]], a fully chromatic brass instrument without valves, employs equivalent numbered notation for slide positions rather than fingering.

===Keyboard instruments===
On [[musical keyboard|keyboard instruments]] all digits are used and the thumb is considered to be a finger. So there are numbers from 1 (thumb) to five.
The numbers are related to the fingers themselves, not to the hand position on the keyboard.
After [[Cristofori]] invented the [[pianoforte]] from the [[harpsichord]] in 1700, and after it became popular in the decades after 1740, eventually replacing the harpsichord, the piano technique developed tremendously (it was parallel with the piano builders´ progress and piano pedagogy, and as part of it piano fingering changed).

====Piano====
There are only few publications about piano fingering.

It is mentioned by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (son of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]) in his book ''Versuch über die wahre Art, das Clavier zu spielen'' (''Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments'', {{ISBN|0-393-09716-1}}) where he dedicated several paragraphs to this topic (see the German original: [http://www.koelnklavier.de/quellen/versuch/kap1-1a.html "Von der Fingersetzung"]).

The British pianist [[Tobias Matthay]] wrote a small book ''Principles of Fingering'' ({{ISBN|0900180420}}).

In 1971 [[Julien Musafia]] published his book "The Art of Fingering in Piano Playing" (M.C.A., New York, N.Y., 90 pages).&lt;ref name=Musafia&gt;{{cite web|last=Musafia|first=Julien|title=The Art of Fingering in Piano Playing|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21254231/Musafia-The-Art-of-Fingering-in-Piano-Playing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes musical examples mostly from the Beethoven's Violin and Piano Sonatas and from the Preludes and Fugues of Shostakovich.

In 2012 [[Rami Bar-Niv]] published his book "The Art of Piano Fingering -- Traditional, Advanced, and Innovative" (AndreA 1060, Tel Aviv, Israel, 212 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Piano Fingering and Establishing a Home Digital Recording Center|author=Lyn Bronson|title=Books &amp; Recordings|year=Summer 2012|publisher= California Music Teacher|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book teaches the craft of piano fingering using music examples, photos and diagrams, exercises, and injury-free techniques.

===String instruments===
[[File:Cello first position.svg|thumb|right|Cello first position fingerings]]
[[File:GuitarFingeringScore.png|thumb|left|Fingered music for guitar: the numbers '''1''' to '''4''' indicate the stopping fingers, '''0''' an open note, circled numbers strings, and dashed numbers slipping]]

On string instruments fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, beginning with the index finger, the thumb not being counted because it does not normally play on a string, and 0 indicating an [[open string (music)|open string]]. In those cases on string instruments where the thumb ''is'' used (such as high notes on a cello in [[thumb position]]), it is represented by a symbol the shape of an O with a vertical stem below(somewhat similar to Ǫ or ϙ, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of the Orchestra |last=Del Mar |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Del Mar |year=1981 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-05062-2 |pages=482–484 (1987 paperback edition) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitar music indicates thumb, occasionally used to finger bass notes on the low E string, with a 'T'. [[Position (string technique)|Position]] may be indicated through [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] (e.g., 3rd) or [[Roman numeral]]s. A string may also be indicated through Roman numerals, often I-IV, or by its open-string note. A change in positions is referred to as a [[Shift (string technique)|shift]].  Guitar music indicates position with Roman numerals and string designations with circled numbers.

The [[classical guitar]] also has a fingering notation system for the [[Classical guitar#Plucking of the string|plucking]] hand, known as ''pima'' (or less commonly ''pimac''), abbreviations of Spanish; where '''p'''=''pulgar'' (thumb), '''i'''=''índice'' (index finger), '''m'''=''medio'' (middle finger), '''a'''=''anular'' (ring finger)&lt;!-- In Spanish, "anular" is spelled with a single "n". --&gt; and, very rarely, '''c'''=''chico'' (little finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustguitar.org/curriculum.php#1 |title=Course of Study for Classical Guitar |publisher=University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music Guitar Department |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually only notated in scores where a passage is particularly difficult, or requires specific fingering for the plucking hand. Otherwise, plucking-hand fingering is generally left to the discretion of the guitarist.

===Woodwind instruments===
{{See also|Recorder (musical instrument)#Fingering}}

Fingering of woodwind instruments is not always simple or intuitive, depending on how the [[acoustic impedance]] of the bore is affected by the distribution and size of apertures along its length, leading to the formation of [[standing wave]]s at the desired pitch. Several alternate fingerings may exist for any given pitch.

Simple [[flute]]s (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s) as well as [[bagpipe]] [[chanter]]s have [[tone hole|open holes]] which are closed by the pads of the player's fingertips. Some such instruments use simple keywork to extend the player's reach for one or two notes. The keywork on instruments such as modern [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[clarinet]]s, or [[oboe]]s is elaborate and variable. Modern flutes typically use the [[Boehm system]] of keywork, while clarinets typically use a [[Boehm system (clarinet)|similarly named system]] invented by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]]. Another system of clarinet keywork, the [[Öhler system]], is used mostly in Germany and Austria.

'''Cross-fingering''' is any fingering, "requiring a closed hole or holes below an open one."&lt;ref name="Randel"&gt;Randel, Don Michael (2003). ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.228. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Opening successive tone holes in woodwind instruments shortens the standing wave in the bore. However, the standing wave propagates past the first open hole, so its frequency can be affected by closing other tone holes further downstream. This is called cross fingering, and in some instruments is used to produce the 'sharps and flats' missing from their natural scales."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John and Wolfe, Joe. ''International Congress on Acoustics'', Rome, Session 8.09, pp.14-15 quoted in Larsen, Grey (2011). ''The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle'', p.42 n.VI Mel Bay. {{ISBN|9781610658898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baroque period cross-fingering improved, allowing music in an increasing variety of keys, but in the Classical and Romantic periods flute design changes such as larger tone holes made cross-fingering less practical while keywork increasingly provided an easy alternative to playing chromatic notes without cross-fingerings.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen (2011), p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boehm system was developed in part to replace cross-fingerings.&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; The first key added to the flute, the short F key,&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; crossed the flute's body, replacing a fingering with an open hole above a closed one, and is presumably the origin of the name for such "cross" fingerings.

'''Fork fingering''' is any fingering where a central hole is uncovered while the holes to each side are kept covered. One advantage of the [[Giorgi flute]] was that it removed the necessity of fork fingering for playing chromatic notes.&lt;ref&gt;Randel (2003), p.352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] introduced an innovation in fingering for the organ and the [[Clavichord|clavier]]. (A similar, although according to Bach's son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] less radical, innovation was introduced by [[François Couperin]], at roughly the same time in 1716, in his book ''[[L'art de toucher le clavecin]]''.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one finger under or over another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing the third finger over the fourth or the fourth finger over the fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb.  Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other fingers over or under one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=J.S. Bach, Volume 1|author=Schweitzer, Newman, Albert Schweitzer|translator-first=Ernest|translator-last=Newman|chapter=IX. The Artist and Teacher|author2=C M Widor|year=1967|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-21631-4|pages=206–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[Mark Lindley|Lindley]] and Boxall showed that the above relies solely on C.P.E. Bach's testimony: all the extant fingerings from J.S.Bach and his circle use the ancient methods, with very limited use of the thumb. More recently it has been shown that all his harpsichord works and most of the organ works as well are playable with the old technique.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lindley and Maria Boxall.

'''Geodetic astronomy''' or '''astro-geodesy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]].

The most important topics are:
* Establishment of [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] systems (e.g. [[ED50]]) or at expeditions
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s 
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination
* modelling the rock [[density|densities]] of the topography and of [[geological]] layers in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]]
* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the background of [[star]]s
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the [[time system]] of physics and [[geosciences]]

Important '''measuring techniques''' are:
* [[Latitude]] and [[longitude]] determination by [[theodolite]]s, tacheometers, [[astrolabe]]s or [[zenith camera]]s
* [[time]] and [[star position]]s by observation of [[star transit]]s, e.g. by [[meridian circle]]s (visual, photographic or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]])
* [[Azimuth]] measurements 
** for the exact orientation of [[geodetic network]]s
** for mutual [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s between terrestrial and space methods
** for improved accuracy by means of "[[Laplace point]]s" at special fixed points
* [[Vertical deflection]] measurements and their use
** in geoid determination
** in mathematical [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]] of very precise networks
** for geophysical and [[geological]] purposes (see above)
* Modern [[space|spatial]] methods
** [[VLBI]] with radio sources ([[quasar]]s)
** [[Astrometry]] of stars by scanning satellites like [[Hipparcos]] or the future [[Gaia probe|Gaia]].

The [[accuracy]] of these methods depends on the [[measuring instrument|instrument]] and its spectral wavelength, the measuring or scanning method, the time amount (versus economy), the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] situation, the stability of the surface resp. the satellite, on mechanical and [[temperature]] effects to the instrument, on the experience and skill of the [[observation|observer]], and on the accuracy of the physical-mathematical [[mathematical model|models]].

Therefore, the accuracy reaches from 60" (navigation, ~1 mile) to 0,001" and better (a few cm; satellites, VLBI), e.g.:
* [[angle]]s ([[vertical direction|vertical]] deflections and [[azimuth]]s) ±1" up to 0,1"
* geoid determination &amp; height systems ca. 5&amp;nbsp;cm up to 0,2&amp;nbsp;cm
* [[astrometry|astronomical]] lat/long and star positions ±1" up to 0,01"
* [[HIPPARCOS]] star positions ±0,001"
* [[VLBI]] quasar positions and [[Earth's rotation]] poles 0,001 to 0,0001" (cm...mm)

'''''God is Red: A Native View of Religion''''', by [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]] ([[Standing Rock Sioux]]), is a [[nonfiction]] [[book]] that discusses traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious views, particularly their relation to Western [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=tinker&gt;Tinker, George E. [http://www.ecologicalhope.org/book-reviews/god-is-red-a-native-view-of-religion-30th-anniversary-edition/ "''God is Red: A Native View of Religion'', 30th Anniversary Edition."] ''Spirituality and Ecological Hope.'' 27 June 2008 (retrieved 31 Aug 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It also details the hardships faced by Native Americans as their country was quickly flooded with foreigners eager for land and other resources. Deloria links the [[anthropocentrism]] of Christian orthodoxy and subsequent American economic philosophies with increasing environmental upheaval. Deloria also explains how religious views are rooted to "place" as opposed to being universal.&lt;ref name=tinker/&gt;

'''Heritage studies''' looks at the relationship between people and tangible and intangible [[History|heritage]] through the use of social science research methods. The publication of the book by [[David Lowenthal]], ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', in 1985 is credited with creating the field (Carman &amp; Sørensen 2009). While related to the disciplines of [[history]], [[heritage conservation]], and [[historic preservation]], heritage studies is not necessarily concerned with the objective representation of the past. History is "the raw facts of the past" (Aitchison, MacLeod, &amp; Shaw 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;96) while heritage "is history processed through mythology, ideology, nationalism, local pride, romantic ideas or just plain marketing" (Schouten 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;21). The meanings of heritage are therefore subjective and rooted in the present; these meanings are defined by social, cultural, and individual processes. In other words, the meanings of heritage can be understood through contemporary sociocultural and experiential values. Lowenthal (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;410) argues that in the realm of human experience, we create heritage; to most people, heritage is therefore more important than history and is a product of human invention and creativity.

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

==Concept==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

'''Jigar Shah''' (born August 30, 1974) is a clean energy entrepreneur in creating market-driven solutions and eliminating market barriers to address [[climate change]].  Shah has recognized this as "Creating Climate Wealth."

Shah maintains that Climate Wealth is created when mainstream investors team up with entrepreneurs, corporations, mainstream capital, and governments at scale to solve the big problems of our time while generating compelling financial returns – not concessionary returns.&lt;ref name="Jigar Shah"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/user/jigar-shah|title=Fast Company: Jigar Shah|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current business initiatives==
Shah is the co-founder and President of Generate Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://gigaom.com/2014/12/04/these-investors-are-using-the-solar-as-a-service-model-for-resources/  |title=Meet Generate Capital, a new way to fund energy projects |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah was the founder and CEO of SunEdison (NASDAQ: SUNE), where he pioneered “no money down solar” and unlocked a multi-billion-dollar solar market, creating the largest solar services company worldwide. Shah is author of ''Creating Climate Wealth: Unlocking the Impact Economy, 2013 Icosa Publishing''.  The book talks about the prominent role of business model innovation, more than new technology, in attracting mainstream capital and unlocking transformational change. In the book, the author pictures reaching our 2020 climate change goals as means to create the next economy with the equivalent of 100,000 companies worldwide, each generating $100 million in sales. Shah argues that, while new technical innovation is valuable, deployment of existing technologies are the key to reaching our near-term climate targets.

Shah serves as a board member of the ''Carbon War Room'', a global organization he previously served as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarplaza.com/article/solar-guru-jigar-shah-on-his-new-book-creating-cli|title= Solar Guru Jigar Shah on his new book: 'Creating Climate Wealth'|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah has also become an outspoken advocate to end all energy subsidies, including those for renewable energy, to "create a level playing field." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/republican-congressman-to-oil-and-gas-industry-no-more-subsidies|title=Jigar Shah argues for an end to fossil fuel subsidies -- and a phase-out of clean energy subsidies'|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Jigar served as a mentor for Unreasonable at Sea, a technology business accelerator for social entrepreneurs seeking to scale their ventures in international markets. Founded by Unreasonable Group, [[Semester at Sea]], and  [[Stanford]]'s [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semesteratsea.org/discover-sas/signature-programs/past-programs/unreasonable-at-sea/&lt;/ref&gt; Shah writes for Unreasonable Group's venture UNREASONABLE.is, a hub for [[social entrepreneurs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unreasonable.is/?s=jigar+shah&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Energy Gang==
Shah is currently co-host of The Energy Gang,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/podcast/the-energy-gang&lt;/ref&gt; a podcast dedicated to exploring the technological, political and market forces driving energy and environmental issues.  On a recent episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/the-energy-gang/week-7-trump-dumps-the-climate|title=Week 7: Trump Dumps the Environment|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah introduced the Jigar Shah Rule - "Countries should not have stupid policy".  As noted by co-host Stephen Lacy, the new ruling is pulled directly from the Jigar Shah Playbook, which suggests you must have competitive options such as volumetric reductions and feed-in tariffs, and the way these were designed seven to eight years ago do not work.

==Past business initiatives==
From 2009 to March 2012, Shah served as the first CEO of the [[Carbon War Room]], the global organization founded by Richard Branson and Virgin United that works to harness the power of entrepreneurship to deploy solution technologies at scale.

Prior to his tenure as Carbon War Room CEO, Shah founded [[SunEdison]] in 2003. The company simplified solar as a service through the implementation of the [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA) business model. That model changed the status quo, allowing organizations to purchase solar energy services under long-term predictably priced contracts and avoid the significant capital costs of ownership and operation of solar energy systems. The SunEdison business model is a recognized{{Vague|date=January 2014}} catalyst that helped turn solar PV into a multi-billion{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} dollar industry worldwide.

Shah previously worked in strategy for [[BP Solar]] and as a contractor for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] on alternative vehicles and fuel cell programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jigar-shah/|title = Jigar Shah Bio |accessdate= 22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in India, Shah moved to the United States with his family when he was one year old.  Shah moved to [[Sterling, Illinois|Sterling]], [[Illinois]] when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="BIF6"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BIF6 |url=http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/bif-6/storytellers/jigar-shah |title=Jigar Shah, taking on a Gigaton of Change |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831145455/http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/bif-6/storytellers/jigar-shah |archivedate=August 31, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalām cosmological argument''' is a modern formulation of the [[cosmological argument]] for the [[existence of God]]; named for the ''[[kalam]]'' (medieval Islamic scholasticism), it was popularized by  [[William Lane Craig]] in his  ''[[The Kalām Cosmological Argument]]'' (1979).
The argument is a variant of the [[unmoved mover]] in [[Aristotelianism]]; it is named for medieval Islamic scholasticism because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]], traced the idea to 11th-century philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. 
 
Since Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Grünbaum]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and [[Quentin Smith]], and has been used in [[Christian apologetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Smith, “Arguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,” Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34–61. See also: [[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and [[Richard Swinburne]] are "among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 101&lt;/ref&gt; while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, "there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments such as [[Five Ways (Aquinas)|that of Thomas Aquinas]], which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 October 2017 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#TypoCosmArgu |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form of the argument==

Craig states the Kalam cosmological argument as a brief [[syllogism]], most commonly rendered as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Whatever begins to exist has a cause;
#The universe began to exist;
#:''Therefore'':
#The universe has a cause.

From the conclusion of the initial syllogism, he appends a further premise and conclusion based upon [[ontological]] analysis of the properties of the cause:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 194&lt;/ref&gt;
#The universe has a cause;
#If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful;
#:''Therefore'':
#An uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful.

Referring to the implications of [[Classical Theism]] that follow from this argument, Craig writes:

:"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ''[[ex nihilo]]'' ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{off topic|date=September 2014}}
The Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.

Its historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]],&lt;ref&gt;al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by Î. A. Çubukçu and H. Atay (Ankara: University of Ankara Press, 1962), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bonaventure|St. Bonaventure]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Kovach, 'The Question of the Eternity of the World in St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas – A Critical Analysis', Southwestern Journal of Philosophy 5 (1974), pp. 141–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#smith|Smith, 2007]]: 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest formulations of the cosmological argument in Islamic tradition comes from Al-Kindi (9th century), who was one of the first Islamic philosophers to attempt to introduce an argument for the existence of God based upon purely empirical premises. His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work "On First Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, trans. Seyyed Hossein, An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Albany : State University of New York Press, 1993 pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

:"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning."&lt;ref name="Craig, 1994: 80"&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. 
It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).&lt;ref&gt;Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century, and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).

Islamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:

:"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also stated:

:"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds."

==Modern debate==

According to atheist philosopher [[Quentin Smith]], "a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig’s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher’s contemporary formulation of an argument for God’s existence."&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Smith, "Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as [[J. L. Mackie]], [[Graham Oppy]], [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], Quentin Smith, physicists [[Paul Davies]], [[Lawrence Krauss]] and [[Victor Stenger]], and authors such as [[Dan Barker]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 4.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science ([[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]]), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as:
:"... whether there needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether something like the universe can be finite and yet not have a beginning, and the nature of infinities and their connection with reality".&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] stated in [[The God Delusion]] when referring to cosmological arguments "The five ‘proofs’ asserted by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century don’t prove anything, and are easily—though I hesitate to say so, given his eminence—exposed as vacuous. The first three are just different ways of saying the same thing, and they can be considered together. All involve an [[infinite regress]]—the answer to a question raises a prior question, and so on ad infinitum.
:1. The Unmoved Mover. Nothing moves without a prior mover. This leads us to a regress, from which the only escape is God. Something had to make the first move, and that something we call God.
:2. The Uncaused Cause. Nothing is caused by itself. Every effect has a prior cause, and again we are pushed back into regress. This has to be terminated by a first cause, which we call God.
:3. The Cosmological Argument. There must have been a time when no physical things existed. But, since physical things exist now, there must have been something non-physical to bring them into existence, and that something we call God.
All three of these arguments rely upon the idea of a regress and invoke God to terminate it. They make the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress. Even if we allow the dubious luxury of arbitrarily conjuring up a terminator to an infinite regress and giving it a name, simply because we need one, there is absolutely no reason to endow that terminator with any of the properties normally ascribed to God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness, creativity of design, to say nothing of such human attributes as listening to prayers, forgiving sins and reading innermost thoughts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The God Delusion|first=Richard|last=Dawkins|date=16 January 2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premise one: "Whatever begins to exist has a cause."===

Craig defends the first premise as follows:&lt;ref name="Craig, 1994: 92"&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 182-190&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Innatism|Rational intuition]]: He states that the first premise is [[axiom|self-evidently]] true, being based upon the  [[causality|Causal Principle]] that "something cannot come into being from nothing", or [[Nothing comes from nothing|"Ex nihilo nihil fit"]], originating from [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] philosophy. He attests that this is a crucial [[first principle]] of science.
#[[Reductio ad absurdum]]: If false, it would be inexplicable why anything and everything does not randomly appear into existence without a cause.
#[[Inductive reasoning]] from both common experience and scientific evidence, which constantly verifies and never falsifies the truth of the first premise.

According to Reichenbach, "the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism", which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical objections====

[[Graham Oppy]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and Wes Morriston have objected to the intuitiveness of the first premise.&lt;ref&gt;Oppy G (2002). Arguing About The Kalam Cosmological Argument. Philo 5 (1):34-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mack|Mackie, 1982]]: 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morriston W (2002). Causes and Beginnings in the Kalam Argument. Faith and philosophy, 19(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Oppy states:

:"Mackie, [Adolf] Grunbaum, [Quentin] Smith and I  —among many others— have taken issue with the first premise: why should it be supposed that absolutely everything which begins to exist has a cause for its beginning to exist?"

Mackie affirms that there is no good reason to assume ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' that an uncaused beginning of all things is impossible. Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to [[David Hume]]'s thesis (''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'') that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mack|Mackie, 1982]]: 85&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], who point out the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.E.M. Anscombe, '"Whatever has a beginning of existence must have a cause": Hume's argument exposed', Analysis XXXIV (1974), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig notes:

:"Hume himself clearly believed in the causal principle. He presupposes throughout the Enquiry that events have causes, and in 1754 he wrote to John Stewart, 'But allow me to tell you that I never asserted so absurd a Proposition as that anything might arise without a cause'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/professor-mackie-and-the-kalam-cosmological-argument Professor Mackie and the Kalam Cosmological Argument], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Hume to John Stewart, February 1754, in The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols., ed. J. T. Grieg (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1932), 1, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Morriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states:

:"We have no experience of the origin of worlds to tell us that worlds don't come into existence like that. We don't even have experience of the coming into being of anything remotely analogous to the “initial singularity” that figures in the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Morriston W (2000). Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause? A Critical Examination of the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Faith and Philosophy, 17:149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, Craig has maintained that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are "not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist", remarking that:

:"The history of twentieth century astrophysical cosmology belies Morriston's claim that people have no strong intuitions about the need of a causal explanation of the origin of time and the universe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause?: A Rejoinder], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the first premise, Andrew Loke reasons that if something (e.g. universe=physical reality as a whole) begins to exist without any antecedent necessary condition whatsoever, then many other kinds of things which can begin to exist within our universe would also begin to exist within our universe without antecedent condition, because (i) there would not be any antecedent condition which would make it the case that only universes (rather than these other kinds of things) begins to exist, and (ii) the properties of universes and the properties of other kinds of things which differentiate between them would be had by them only when they had already begun to exist. In that case our universe would have been very different.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Andrew Loke, &lt;em&gt;God and Ultimate Origins&lt;/em&gt; (Cham: Springer International, 2017), viii-ix, 138-153]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quantum physics====

A common objection to premise one appeals to the phenomenon of [[quantum indeterminacy]], where, at the subatomic level, the [[causality|causal principle]] appears to break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Superforce|edition= |last= Davies|first= Paul|year= 1982|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= |page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig replies that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] of [[Quantum Mechanics]], pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning [[David Bohm]]) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland, James Porter, and William Lane. Craig. Philosophical foundations for a Christian worldview. Downers Grove, Ill: InterVarsity P. 469&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Quentin Smith has cited the example of [[virtual particles]], which appear and disappear from observation, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Q (1988), "The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe," Philosophy of Science 55:39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing]]'', cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how space-time and matter can emerge from "nothing" (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:

:"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused. Despite Craig's claim that theories postulating that the universe 'could pop into existence uncaused' are incapable of 'sincere affirmation,' such similar theories are in fact being taken seriously by scientists."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 106. Martin lists the following sources as examples: Edward P. Tryon, "Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation?" ''Nature'', 246, December 14, 1973, pp. 396–397; Edward P. Tryon, "What Made the World? ''New Scientist'', 8, March 1984, pp. 14–16; Alexander Vilenkin, "Creation of Universes from Nothing," ''Physics Letters'', 117B, 1982, pp. 25–28; Alexander Vilenkin, "Birth of Inflationary Universes," ''Physical Review'', 27, 1983, pp. 2848–2855; L. P. Grishchuck and Y. B. Zledovich, "Complete Cosmological Theories," ''The Quantum Structure of Space and Time'', ed. M. J. Duff and C. J. Isham (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 409–422; Quentin Smith, "The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe," ''Philosophy of Science'', 55, 1988, pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher of science [[David Albert]] has criticised the use of the term "nothing" in describing the quantum vacuum. In a review of Krauss's book, he states:

:"Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states — no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems — are particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn’t this or that particular arrangement of the fields — what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple ''absence'' of the fields."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0 On the Origin of Everything], David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Craig also argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as "nothing", therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as "uncaused". On the topic of virtual particles, he writes:

:"For virtual particles do not literally come into existence spontaneously out of nothing. Rather the energy locked up in a vacuum fluctuates spontaneously in such a way as to convert into evanescent particles that return almost immediately to the vacuum."&lt;ref&gt;"The Caused Beginning of the Universe: a Response to Quentin Smith." British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 44 (1993): 623-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premise two: "The universe began to exist."===

Craig justifies premise two using both physical arguments with evidence from cosmology and physics, and metaphysical arguments for the impossibility of [[actual infinities]] in reality.

====Cosmology and physics====

For physical evidence, Craig appeals to:

#Scientific confirmation against a past-infinite universe in the form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-existence-of-god-and-the-beginning-of-the-universe The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;
#Scientific evidence that the universe began to exist a finite time ago at the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
#The [[Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Borde, A. Guth and A. Vilenkin (2003). "Inflationary space-times are incomplete in past directions". Physical Review Letters 90 (15): 151301.&lt;/ref&gt; a cosmological theorem which deduces that any universe that has, on average, been expanding throughout its history cannot be infinite in the past but must have a past space-time boundary.

Professor [[Alexander Vilenkin]], one of the three authors of the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem, writes:

:"A remarkable thing about this theorem is its sweeping generality. We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein’s equations. So, if Einstein’s gravity requires some modification, our conclusion will still hold. The only assumption that we made was that the expansion rate of the universe never gets below some nonzero value, no matter how small."&lt;ref&gt;Vilenkin, A. (2007) Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor J. Stenger]] has referred to the Aguirre-Gratton model&lt;ref&gt;Aguirre A and Gratton S (2002). Steady-state eternal inflation; Phys. Rev. D 65, 083507&lt;/ref&gt; for [[eternal inflation]] as an exemplar by which others disagree with the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Victor J. Stenger. God and the Folly of Faith: The Incompatibility of Science and Religion. Prometheus Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In private correspondence with Stenger, Vilenkin remarked how the Aguirre-Gratton model attempts to evade a beginning by reversing the "arrow of time" at ''t = 0'', but that: "This makes the moment ''t = 0'' rather special. I would say no less special than a true beginning of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor J. Stenger | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BAXtVsfdcC | title = The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: Why the Universe Is Not Designed for Us | orig-year = | agency =  | edition = | location = | year = 2011-04-15 | publisher = Prometheus Books| at = | volume = | issue = | pages = | page = 244 | series =  | isbn = 9781616144449| ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the "State of the Universe" conference at Cambridge University in January 2012, Vilenkin discussed problems with various theories that would claim to avoid the need for a cosmological beginning, alleging the untenability of eternal inflation, cyclic and cosmic egg models, eventually concluding: "All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328474.400-why-physicists-cant-avoid-a-creation-event.html Why Physicists Can't Avoid A Creation Event], New Scientist 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://now.tufts.edu/articles/beginning-was-beginning In the Beginning Was the Beginning], Tufts Now 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Vilenkin said:

:"In quantum physics, events do not necessarily have a cause, just some probability. As such, there is some probability for the universe to pop out of 'nothing.' You can find the relative probability for it to be this size or that size and have various properties, but there will not be a particular cause for any of it, just probabilities. I say 'nothing' in quotations because the nothing that we were referring to here is the absence of matter, space and time. That is as close to nothing as you can get, but what is still required here is the laws of physics. So the laws of physics should still be there, and they are definitely not nothing."

When asked if his work "proves the existence of God or at least of a divine moment of creation," Vilenkin responded "I don’t think it proves anything one way or another."

In 2015, cosmologists Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das published a paper outlining a model which applies quantum correction terms to complement Einstein's theory of general relativity and suggests that the universe may have existed forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314009381 Cosmology from quantum potential], Physics Letters B, February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Actual infinities====

On the impossibility of [[actual infinities]], Craig asserts:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;

#The metaphysical impossibility of an actually infinite series of past events by citing [[David Hilbert]]'s famous [[Hilbert's Hotel]] [[thought experiment]] and [[Laurence Sterne]]'s story of [[Tristram Shandy]].{{huh|date=July 2017}}
#The mathematical impossibility of forming an actual infinite by successive addition.

Michael Martin disagrees with these assertions by Craig, saying:

:"Craig's ''a priori'' arguments are unsound or show at most that actual infinities have odd properties. This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Loke, however, thinks that even if an actual infinite is possible, there is an argument to show that it is impossible to traverse it. He proposes the following argument:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# If time is beginningless, then it would be the case that a causal series which has members being generated one after another as long as time exists would arrived at an actual infinite of generations of members at a particular time.
# It is not metaphysically possible for a causal series which has members being generated one after another as long as time exists to arrive at an actual infinite of generations of members at a particular time.
# Therefore, it is not metaphysically possible that time is beginningless.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Andrew Loke, &lt;em&gt;God and Ultimate Origins&lt;/em&gt; (Cham: Springer International, 2017)]], 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Loke, in fact, also proposes an argument against the metaphysical possibility of a concrete actual infinite using the case of a  ‘Christmas present generator’ and a 'person generator.' &lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conclusion: "The universe has a cause."===

In a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1979, Michael Martin states:
:"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103&lt;/ref&gt;
Martin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation "''ex nihilo''", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent "creating" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.
#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.
#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause.
#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. 
#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.

Craig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an "uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.

===Theories of time===

Craig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the "tensed theory of time" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the "tenseless theory of time" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not "begin to exist":

:"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has defended the A-theory against objections from [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[Hybrid A-B theory of time|Hybrid A-B]] theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oaklander |first=L.

:"Despite the fact that presentism has the firm backing of common sense and eternalism revolts against it, [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] is widely regarded as almost the default view in contemporary debates, and [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]] as a highly problematic view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Yuri |last1=Balashov |title=A Future for Presentism |journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |year=2007 |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23018-a-future-for-presentism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Balashov, Craig criticises Balashov for adopting a [[verificationism|verificationist]] methodology that fails to address the metaphysical and theological foundations of the A-theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/response-to-mccall-and-balashov Response to McCall and Balashov], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been argued that a defense of the Kalam cosmological argument does not have to involve such a commitment to the A-theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Watr|Waters, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a '''local administrative unit (LAU)''' is a low level [[administrative division]] of a country, ranked below a [[province]], [[region]], or [[State (administrative division)|state]].  Not all countries describe their locally governed areas this way, but it can be descriptively applied anywhere to refer to counties, municipalities, etc.

In the [[European Union]], LAUs are basic components of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions. For each [[Member of the European Union|EU member country]], two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) are defined: LAU 1 and LAU 2, which were previously called NUTS 4 and NUTS 5 respectively, until the NUTS regulation went into force in July 2003. For some countries, the LAU 1 level is not defined, and thus equivalent to the NUTS 3 level. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]].

The '''Max Planck Institute for Mathematics''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik}}, '''MPIM''') is a prestigious  research institute located in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. It is named in honor of the [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]] [[Max Planck]]
and forms part of the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft''), an association of 84 institutes engaging  in fundamental research in the arts and the sciences. The MPIM is the only Max Planck institute specializing in [[pure mathematics]].

The Institute was founded by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] in 1980, having emerged from the collaborative research center "Theoretical Mathematics" ([[:de:Sonderforschungsbereich|Sonderforschungsbereich]] "Theoretische Mathematik"). Hirzebruch shaped the institute as its director until his retirement in 1995. Currently, the institute is managed by a board of five directors consisting of [[Peter Teichner]] (managing director), [[Werner Ballmann]], [[Gerd Faltings]], [[Peter Scholze]],  and [[Don Zagier]]. [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] was, and [[Yuri Manin]] and [[Günter Harder]] are, acting as [[emeriti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/91 |author=Max Planck Institute for Mathematics |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |title=About the MPIM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Max Planck Institute for Mathematics offers mathematicians from around the world the opportunity to visit Bonn and engage in [[sabbatical]] work lasting from weeks to several months. 
This guest program distinguishes the MPIM from other Max Planck institutes, and results in only a limit number of permanent positions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/91 |author=Max Planck Institute for Mathematics |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |title=About the MPIM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of separate departments within the institute. 

The research of the members and guests of the institute can be classified into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/76 |author=Max Planck Institute for Mathematics |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |title=Guest program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2018">In [[human geography]], '''McNeill's law''' is the process outlined in [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill's]] book ''Plagues and Peoples''.  The process described concerns the role of [[pathogens|microbial disease]] in the conquering of people-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plagues and People |last= McNeill |first=William |isbn=978-1439503133 |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McNeill's Law, the microbiological aspect of conquest and invasion has been the deciding principle or one of the deciding principles in both the expansion of certain [[empire]]s (as during the emigration to the Americas) and the containment in others (as during the [[crusades]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1008/features/a-germ-of-an-idea.shtml | title=A germ of an idea | publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Alumni Association | work=University of Chicago Magazine | date=July–August 2010 | accessdate=May 3, 2016 | author=Goodier, Robert | issn=0041-9508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances in history==
The first people-group fully [[genocide|wiped out]] due to [[Age of Exploration|European expansion]] (with the possible exception of the [[Arawaks]]) was the [[Guanches]] of the [[Canary Islands]].  Despite an inbred ferocity, superior knowledge of the land and even a possible tactical superiority, they were eventually wiped out through the concentrated efforts of the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]].  McNeill's Law would place the deciding factor squarely on the introduction of deadly diseases and parasites from the mainland to the previously geographically isolated islanders.

This is the likely explanation, as what records still exist show numerous deaths by disease on the islands and a declining birth-rate, leading eventually to the almost complete end of the Guanches as a race.

Other instances include the devastation of the [[Incas]] by [[smallpox]].

[[File:Service mark of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).svg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;The service mark of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute depicting a [[Saccopharyngiformes|Gulper eel]].]]
The '''Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute''' ('''MBARI''') is a private, non-profit [[oceanographic]] research center in [[Moss Landing, California]]. MBARI was founded in 1987 by [[David Packard]], and is primarily funded by the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]]. Christopher Scholin serves as the institute's president and chief executive officer, managing a work force of approximately 220 scientists, engineers, and operations and administrative staff.

At MBARI, scientists and engineers work together to develop new tools and methods for studying the ocean. Long-term funding from the David and Lucile  Packard Foundation allows the institute to take on studies that traditional granting institutions may be reluctant to sponsor. Part of David Packard's charge for MBARI was to "Take risks. Ask big questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; if you don't make mistakes, you're not reaching far enough."

MBARI's campus in Moss Landing is located near the center of Monterey Bay, at the head of the [[Monterey Canyon]]. Monterey Bay is one of the most biologically diverse bodies of waters in the world, and the underlying submarine canyon is one of the deepest underwater canyons along the continental United States. With this 4,000-meter-deep submarine canyon only a few ship-hours from their base of operations, institute scientists enjoy an advantageous proximity to this natural, deep-sea "laboratory".

MBARI is not open to the general public, but it has an open house once a year. Although MBARI is a sister institution to the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], the two organizations have entirely separate management and funding.

== Mission ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mission of MBARI is to achieve and maintain a position as a world center for advanced research and education in ocean science and technology, and to do so through the development of better instruments, systems, and methods for scientific research in the deep waters of the ocean. MBARI emphasizes the peer relationship between engineers and scientists as a basic principle of its operation. All of the activities of MBARI must be characterized by excellence, innovation, and vision."&amp;nbsp;—David Packard&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Research ==
MBARI's scientists, engineers, and support staff collaborate on a wide range of cutting-edge marine research projects enabled by innovative technology. MBARI's current efforts span the interdisciplinary fields of ocean science, including marine biology, geology, chemistry, and biological  oceanography. MBARI also develops new oceanographic research tools and techniques, as well as technology related to ocean observatories.

Much of MBARI's research focuses on the development and use of robotic vehicles and other automated methods for gathering information in the ocean. These tools provide a unique view of ocean life and physical phenomena.

== Research vessels ==
[[Image:RV Western Flyer.jpg|thumb|left|Research vessel ''Western Flyer'' at MBARI Pier]]
MBARI's flagship research vessel is the {{Ship|RV|Western Flyer}}, a 35.6-meter (117-foot) small water-plane area twin hull (SWATH) ship deploying the [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]], ROV ''Doc Ricketts'', through a moon pool in the center of the ship. The ''Western Flyer'' has supported ROV dives along much of the west coast of North America, from the Gulf of California to Vancouver Island, as well as around the Hawaiian islands.

In December 2011, MBARI retired the {{Ship|RV|Point Lobos}} after 23 years of service. In  2012, MBARI will also be retiring the {{Ship|RV|Zephyr}}, which has served as a launch platform for MBARI's [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs). These two boats will be replaced by a single, larger boat, the {{Ship|RV|Rachel Carson|2003|2}}, which MBARI purchased in the summer of 2011, and which is expected to be operational in 2012. The Research Vessel ''Rachel Carson'' will be able to launch both ROVs and AUVs, as well as conduct multi-day expeditions.

== Underwater vehicles ==
MBARI has been a pioneer in the development and scientific use of two types of underwater robots—remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ROVs are robotic submersibles that are connected through a very long tether to a ship at the sea surface. They are controlled by pilots and researchers on board the surface ship. AUVs are robotic submersibles that are programmed at the sea surface and then released to collect data autonomously, with little or no human intervention.

MBARI's ROV ''Doc Ricketts'' is a four kilometer depth-rated vehicle, named after the pioneering marine ecologist [[Ed Ricketts]]. ROV ''Doc Ricketts'' has been deployed from the R/V ''Western Flyer'' since 2009, when it replaced ROV ''Tiburon'', which had been deployed from the R/V ''Western Flyer'' since 1997. 
[[Image:ROV Ventana on Point Lobos.jpg|thumb|upright|ROV ''Ventana'' on board of the MBARI research vessel ''Point Lobos'']]

ROV ''Ventana'' is a 1.8&amp;nbsp;km depth-rated vehicle. It was built for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute by International Submarine Engineering according to specifications developed by David Packard and the original core group of scientists and engineers at MBARI. The vehicle was delivered in 1988 with a standard suite of instruments and cameras. Data collection sensors, a high definition camera, and animal collection devices have been added over the course of more than 3,600 dives.

In addition to ROVs, MBARI has also developed untethered undersea robots called autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). MBARI's ''Dorado''-class AUVs are 53.3 centimeters (21 inches) in diameter and can be as short as 2.4 meters (8 feet) or as long as 6.4 meters (21 feet), depending on the mission. ''Dorado''-class AUVs currently operational at MBARI include the upper-water-column AUV, the seafloor mapping AUV, and the imaging AUV. The core vehicle elements are deep-rated (the mapping AUV is 6,000 meters rated) and have been operated as long as 20 hours.

MBARI's ''Tethys'' AUV, also called the long-range AUV, is a new AUV designed to operate over longer ranges. ''Tethys'' is 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12 inches) in diameter, 230&amp;nbsp;cm (7.5 feet) long, and weighs 120&amp;nbsp;kg.  ''Tethys'' provides capabilities falling between existing propeller driven AUVs, which typically have endurances on the order of a day, and buoyancy-driven vehicles (gliders) that can operate for many months. In October 2011, ''Tethys'' spent 24 days at sea traveling nearly 1,800&amp;nbsp;km.

== Notable achievements ==
Frequent forays with remotely operated vehicles to the deep Monterey Canyon have enabled MBARI researchers to discover new animal species on a regular basis, and to begin to understand their significance in the ecology of the deep sea. MBARI biologists have made major contributions to research methods and the understanding of the quantity and diversity of life in the ocean.

Some of the more notable species first described by MBARI researchers include ''[[Stellamedusa ventana]]'' (bumpy jelly), ''[[Tiburonia|Tiburonia granrojo]]'' (big red), ''[[Chaetopterus pugaporcinus]]'' (pigbutt worm), and the ''[[Osedax]]'' species of bone-eating worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G.

In 2008, MBARI deployed the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS)—the first deep-sea cabled observatory offshore of the continental United States. MARS enables researchers to hook up a variety of scientific instruments such as earthquake monitors and low-light video cameras and leave them on the deep seafloor for extended periods of time. Funded in 2002 by a grant from the National Science Foundation, the MARS Observatory was developed through a collaborative effort by MBARI, [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], the [[University of Washington]] Applied Physics Laboratory, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, L-3 MariPro, and [[Alcatel-Lucent]].

MBARI researchers have also made pioneering developments in the area of microbial oceanography. MBARI Postdoctoral Fellow Oded Beja and Scientist [[Edward DeLong]] were the first to discover a gene in several species of bacteria responsible for production of the protein rhodopsin, previously unheard of in the domain Bacteria. First developments in several areas of metagenomics have also been made at MBARI. DeLong was among the first to use metagenomics in the ocean and MBARI Scientist [[Alexandra Worden]] led the development of eukaryotic targeted metagenomics, which allows specific eukaryotic cells to be selected from natural samples and partial genomes from those uncultured cells then sequenced, assembled and analyzed.

In 2001, MBARI scientists and engineers detected the onset and development of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) using the [[Environmental Sample Processor]] (ESP)—an undersea, robotic DNA laboratory. Using the ESP, researchers are able to conduct molecular biological analyses remotely, in real-time, over a sustained period, and with interactive capability. The ESP provides in situ collection and analysis of water samples, such as the analysis of the genetic material of marine microorganisms in seawater.

The '''Nuclear Physics Institute of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]]''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Ústav Jaderné Fyziky Akademie věd ČR'') is a public research institution located in [[Řež]], [[Central Bohemian Region]], [[Czech Republic]]. It was established in 1972 from the Physics Section of the former institute of Nuclear Research of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.cz/index.html The Czech Academy of Sciences official website], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1955 the Nuclear Research Institute CSAS (originally called the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences) was founded as a basic institution for nuclear research. As the nuclear power industry developed in the Czech Republic, the institute was in 1972 divided into several parts. The largest part was subsided to the Czechoslovak Commission for Atomic Energy under the name Nuclear Research Institute and later privatized. The second largest part the Nuclear Physics Institute of the CAS remains under the Academy of Sciences.  Former Institute of Radiation Dosimetry CAS in [[Prague]] was connected to NPI as a detached branch in 1994.

== Research ==

Primary focus of the institute is [[nuclear physics]], both theoretical and experimental. It carries out studies in the nuclear [[spectroscopy]] of [[Beta radiation|beta]] and [[gamma radiation]], nuclear reactions including the collisions of heavy [[ions]] and hyper-nuclear physics. Its work is also focused on related fields, such as the study of the solid phase using [[neutron scattering]], mathematical physics and theoretical subnuclear physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accs.ujf.cas.cz/ Nuclear Physics Institute of the CAS official website], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

*Director's Office
*Technical and Economic Administration
*Department of Theoretical Physics
*Department of Nuclear Spectroscopy
*Department of Nuclear Reactions
*Department of Neutron Physics
*Department of Radiopharmaceuticals
*Department of Radiation Dosimetry
*Department of Accelerators

== Isochronous cyclotron U-120M ==

Isochronous cyclotron U-120M is the primary experimental facility of the institute and it is the only [[cyclotron]] in the Czech Republic. It has been operating since 1977. The cyclotron is used both for fundamental research and applications. It can accelerate ions within the range of the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] A/q = 1 - 2.8. The present internal radial ion source is suitable for acceleration of H^+, D^+, 4-He^+2 and 3-He^+2. Maximum [[proton]] energy is 36 MeV, and the maximum energy for heavier ions is given by 40 q^2/A MeV. Currents of an internal beam of protons and [[deuterons]] can reach 100 microA, and for extracted beams 5 microA. Particles are extracted from the cyclotron chamber by means of a 3-section deflection electrostatic system to the entrance of the beam lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mx.ujf.cas.cz/institute/expr1.html Isochronous cyclotron U-120M], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polymer fume fever''' or '''fluoropolymer fever''', also informally called '''Teflon flu''', is an inhalation fever caused by the fumes released when [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE, known under the trade name [[Teflon]]) reaches temperatures of 300&amp;nbsp;°C (572&amp;nbsp;°F) to 450&amp;nbsp;°C (842&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shusterman|first=D.

Onset occurs about 4 to 8 hours after exposure to the [[pyrolysis]] products of PTFE. A [[leukocytosis|high white blood cell count]] may be seen and chest x-ray findings are usually minimal.

The polymer fumes are especially harmful to certain birds whose breathing, optimized for rapidity, allows toxins which are excluded by human lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Predictive informatics (PI)''' is the combination of [[predictive modeling]] and [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] applied to healthcare, pharmaceutical, life sciences and business industries.

Predictive informatics enables researchers, analysts, physicians and decision-makers to aggregate and analyze disparate types of data, recognize patterns and trends within that data, and make more informed decisions in an effort to preemptively alter future outcomes.

==Current uses of PI==
===Healthcare===
Over the past decade the increased usage of [[electronic health records]] has produced vast amounts of clinical data that is now computable. Predictive informatics integrates this data with other datasets (e.g., genotypic, phenotypic) in centralized and standardized data repositories upon which predictive analytics may be conducted.

===Pharmaceuticals===
The [[biopharmaceutical]] industry uses predictive informatics (a superset of [[chemoinformatics]]) to integrate information resources to transform data into knowledge in order to make better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.

===Systems biology===
Scientists involved in [[systems biology]] employ predictive informatics to integrate complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources.

===Other uses===
Predictive informatics and analytics are also used in financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, and travel industries.

'''Queueing theory''' is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or [[wikt:queue|queues]].&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite book | title = Probability, Statistics and Queueing Theory | first = V. | last = Sundarapandian | publisher = PHI Learning | year = 2009 | chapter = 7.

==Spelling==
The spelling "queueing" over "queuing" is typically encountered in the academic research field. In fact, one of the flagship journals of the profession is named ''[[Queueing Systems]]''.

== Single queueing nodes ==
Single queueing nodes are usually described using [[Kendall's notation]] in the form ''A''/''S''/''C'' where ''A'' describes the time between arrivals to the queue, ''S'' the size of jobs and ''C'' the number of servers at the node.&lt;ref name="tijms"&gt;Tijms, H.C, ''Algorithmic Analysis of Queues", Chapter 9 in  A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = D.

Markov, Extension of the law of large numbers to dependent quantities, Izvestiia Fiz.-Matem. Obsch. Kazan Univ., (2nd Ser.), 15(1906), pp. 135&amp;ndash;156 [Also [37], pp.
339&amp;ndash;361].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Agner Krarup Erlang]], a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue2/erlang/index.html |title=Agner Krarup Erlang (1878 - 1929) &amp;#124; plus.maths.org |publisher=Pass.maths.org.uk |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Asmussen | first1 = S.

* M stands for Markov or memoryless and means arrivals occur according to a Poisson process
* D stands for deterministic and means jobs arriving at the queue which require a fixed amount of service
* ''k'' describes the number of servers at the queueing node (''k'' = 1, 2,...). If there are more jobs at the node than there are servers, then jobs will queue and wait for service

The [[M/M/1 queue]] is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process and have [[exponentially distributed]] service requirements. In an [[M/G/1 queue]], the G stands for general and indicates an arbitrary [[probability distribution]]. The M/G/1 model was solved by [[Felix Pollaczek]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Pollaczek, F., Ueber eine Aufgabe der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie, Math. Z. 1930&lt;/ref&gt; a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by [[Aleksandr Khinchin]] and now known as the [[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]].&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

After the 1940s queueing theory became an area of research interest to mathematicians.&lt;ref name="century1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whittle | first1 = P. | authorlink1 = Peter Whittle (mathematician)| doi = 10.1287/opre.50.1.227.17792 | title = Applied Probability in Great Britain | journal = [[Operations Research (journal)|Operations Research]]| volume = 50 | pages = 227–239| year = 2002 | jstor = 3088474| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 [[David George Kendall]] solved the GI/M/k queue&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, D.G.:Stochastic processes occurring in the theory of queues and their analysis by the method of the imbedded Markov chain, Ann. Math. Stat. 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the modern notation for queues, now known as [[Kendall's notation]]. In 1957 Pollaczek studied the GI/G/1 using an [[integral equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollaczek, F., Problèmes Stochastiques posés par le phénomène de formation d'une queue&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Kingman]] gave a formula for the [[Mean sojourn time|mean waiting time]] in a [[G/G/1 queue]]: [[Kingman's formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kingman | first1 = J.

The [[matrix geometric method]] and [[matrix analytic method]]s have allowed queues with [[phase-type distribution|phase-type distributed]] inter-arrival and service time distributions to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ramaswami | first1 = V. | doi = 10.1080/15326348808807077 | title = A stable recursion for the steady state vector in markov chains of m/g/1 type | journal = Communications in Statistics.

Problems such as performance metrics for the [[M/G/k queue]] remain an open problem.&lt;ref name="century" /&gt;&lt;ref name="century1" /&gt;

[[File:Fifo queue.png|thumb|350px|First in first out (FIFO) queue example.]]
Various scheduling policies can be used at queuing nodes:

;[[Processor sharing]]: Service capacity is shared equally between customers.&lt;ref name="penttinen"/&gt;
;Priority: Customers with high priority are served first.&lt;ref name="penttinen"/&gt; Priority queues can be of two types, non-preemptive (where a job in service cannot be interrupted) and preemptive (where a job in service can be interrupted by a higher-priority job). No work is lost in either model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Harchol-Balter | first1 = M.|author1-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | chapter = Scheduling: Non-Preemptive, Size-Based Policies | doi = 10.1017/CBO9781139226424.039 | title = Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems | pages = 499 | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781139226424 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Service facility
*Single server: customers line up and there is only one server
*Several parallel servers - Single queue: customers line up and there are several servers
*Several servers - Several queues: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue

;Customer’s behavior of waiting
*Balking: customers deciding not to join the queue if it is too long
*Jockeying: customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by doing so
*Reneging: customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service

==Simple two-equation queue==
A common basic queuing system is attributed to [[Erlang distribution|Erlang]], though its exact origin remains unclear. The queue refers to a single server with one demand rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;), one dropout rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;), and one rate of service (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;), for which the length of the queue ''L'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\delta-\sigma}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an exponential distribution for the rates, the waiting time ''W'' can be defined as the proportion of demand that is served. This is equal to the exponential survival rate of those who do not drop out over the waiting period, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma}{\delta} = e^{-W{\mu}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second equation is commonly rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{1}{\mu}ln\frac{\delta}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

The two-stage one-box model is common in epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández-Suarez|first=Carlos|date=2010|title=An application of queuing theory to SIS and SEIS epidemic models|url=|journal=Math. Biosci.|volume=7|pages=809–823|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queueing networks==
Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by what's known as customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network.

For networks of ''m'' nodes, the state of the system can be described by an ''m''–dimensional vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of customers at each node.

The simplest non-trivial network of queues is called [[Jackson network|tandem queues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/bs3a07l13-14.pdf#page=4&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant results in this area were [[Jackson network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.

The [[normalizing constant]] can be calculated with the [[Buzen's algorithm]], proposed in 1973.&lt;ref name="buzen-1973"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buzen | first1 = J. P. | authorlink = Jeffrey P.

Networks of customers have also been investigated, [[Kelly network]]s where customers of different classes experience different priority levels at different service nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = F.

::P : the probability of n customers in system

::n :the number of people in system

*Let E represent the number of times of entering state n, and L represent the number of times of leaving state n. We have &lt;math&gt;|E-L| \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. When the system arrives at steady state, which means t, we have, therefore arrival rate=removed rate.

P_0=\frac{1}{1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\prod_{i=0}^
{n-1}\frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_{i+1}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Routing algorithms===
In discrete time networks where there is a constraint on which service nodes can be active at any time, the max-weight scheduling algorithm chooses a service policy to give optimal throughput in the case that each job visits only a single person &lt;ref name="Manuel" /&gt;service node. In the more general case where jobs can visit more than one node, [[backpressure routing]] gives optimal throughput. A [[network scheduler]] must choose a [[queuing algorithm]], which affects the characteristics of the larger network{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. See also [[Stochastic scheduling]] for more about scheduling of queueing systems.

==Mean field limits==
[[Mean field model]]s consider the limiting behaviour of the [[empirical measure]] (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (''m'' above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bobbio | first1 = A. | last2 = Gribaudo | first2 = M. | last3 = Telek | first3 = M.

==Fluid limits==
{{main article|fluid limit}}
Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows the stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bramson | first1 = M. | title = A stable queueing network with unstable fluid model | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1029962815 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 818 | year = 1999 | jstor = 2667284| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations==
{{Main article|heavy traffic approximation}}
In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a [[reflected Brownian motion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H. | last2 = Whitt | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/BF01149260 | title = Diffusion approximations for open queueing networks with service interruptions | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 335 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process]] or more general [[diffusion process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = K. | title = Diffusion Approximation for Open State-Dependent Queueing Networks in the Heavy Traffic Situation | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1177004602 | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 958 | year = 1995 | jstor = 2245101| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of dimensions of the RBM is equal to the number of queueing nodes and the diffusion is restricted to the non-negative [[orthant]].

Often, especially in the context of the [[common practice period]], most or all of the [[melody]] and [[harmony]] of a [[musical work]] is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] with a standard [[key signature]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn Nadine (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', seventh edition: vol. 1, p. 25. Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the principle of [[octave]] equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or [[interval (music)|interval]]) between two successive notes of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Michael (2013). ''Musical Scales of the World'', pp. 2–3. The Note Tree. {{ISBN|978-0-9575470-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by [[microtonal music]], there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a [[semitone]] interval, while a [[major scale]] is defined by the interval pattern T–T–S–T–T–T–S, where T stands for [[whole tone]] (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], [[major scale|major]], [[minor scale|minor]], and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first [[Degree (music)|degree]] (or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, [[C major]] indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

==Background==

===Scales, steps, and intervals===
[[File:Major scale in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|Diatonic scale in the [[chromatic circle]]]]

Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are ''[[octave]]-repeating'', meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]] is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.

The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a [[Degree (music)|scale step]].

The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the root of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

===Pitch===
A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see [[scientific pitch notation]]) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played, the [[octave]] they take on can be altered.

&lt;/score&gt;|width=350|caption=The [[chromatic scale]], ascending}}Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:

* [[chromatic scale|Chromatic]], or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)
* [[octatonic scale|Octatonic]] (8 notes per octave): used in [[jazz]] and [[modernism (music)|modern classical music]]
* [[heptatonic scale|Heptatonic]] (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale
* [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music
* [[pentatonic scale|Pentatonic]] (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music, especially in Asian music; also known as the "black note" scale
* [[tetratonic scale|Tetratonic]] (4 notes), [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] (3 notes), and [[ditonic scale|ditonic]] (2 notes): generally limited to [[prehistoric music|prehistoric]] ("primitive") music
* [[monotonic scale|Monotonic]] (1 note): limited use in liturgy, and for effect in modern art music{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--Monotonicity is not controversial, but who claims there is such a thing as a "monotonic scale"?--&gt;

Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being [[hemitonia|hemitonic]], [[cohemitonia|cohemitonic]], or having imperfections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|title=All The Scales|author=|date=|website=www.allthescales.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015071228/http://allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.

"The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality."&lt;ref&gt;Nzewi, Meki, and Odyke Nzewi (2007), ''A Contemporary Study of Musical Arts''. Pretoria: Centre for Indigenous Instrumental African Music and Dance. Volume 1 p. 34 {{ISBN|978-1-920051-62-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones."&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, and Helen Myers (1976). ''Folk Music in the United States'', p.39. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-1557-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being [[palindrome|palindromic]], [[Chirality|chiral]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/#chirality {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330211555/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |date=30 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or having rotational symmetry as in Messaien's [[modes of limited transposition]]. 

Scales can also be described by their distribution patterns and possibilities for notation. For example, a [[heliotonic]] scale is one that can be notated with one note head on each line and space, using only single and double alterations (flats, double-flats, sharps, and double-sharps). Thus all heliotonic scales are [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]], but not all heptatonic scales are heliotonic. Since heliotonia is a metric of a scale's tone distribution pattern, is related to evenness, coherence, spectra variation, and the [[Generic_and_specific_intervals|Myhill Property]].

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 5-note scale has 10 of these [[Harmony|harmonic]] intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp.7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the scale is not a [[Chord (music)|chord]], and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain [[key (music)|key]] intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of [[Chord (music)|chords]] taken naturally from the scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A musical scale that contains [[tritone]]s is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is ''atritonic''.  A scale or [[Chord (music)|chord]] that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic]].

===Scales in composition===
Scales can be abstracted from [[performance]] or [[musical composition|composition]]. They are also often used [[precompositional]]ly to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[L'Isle Joyeuse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Western music==
{{See also|Musical mode}}
Scales in [[European classical music|traditional Western music]] generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by [[Music Terminology|whole and half step]] [[interval (music)|intervals]] of ''tones'' and ''semitones.'' The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.

Western music in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note [[diatonic scale]] C–D–E–F–G–A–B. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the [[tritone]].

Music of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:
* The [[diatonic scale]] (seven notes)—this includes the major scale and the natural minor
* The melodic and harmonic [[minor scale]]s (seven notes)

These scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces ''modulation,'' which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a "tonic" diatonic scale and modulate to the "dominant" scale a fifth above.{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {

\relative c' {

} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[whole tone scale]] starting on F, ascending}}In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:

* The [[chromatic scale]] (twelve notes)
* The [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]] (six notes)
* The [[pentatonic scale]] (five notes)
* The octatonic or [[diminished scale]]s (eight notes)
{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {

\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 7/4
  c4 d es fis g aes b c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[Hungarian minor scale]] starting on C, ascending}}A large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:

* The [[Phrygian dominant scale]] (a mode of the harmonic minor scale)
* The [[Arabic maqam|Arabic scales]]
* The [[Hungarian minor scale]]
* The [[Byzantine music]] scales (called echoi)
* The [[Persian scale]]
Scales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered ''gapped'' relative to the diatonic scale. An ''auxiliary scale'' is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: [[modulation (music)]] and [[Petrushka chord|Auxiliary diminished scale]].

==Note names==
In many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C [[major scale]] (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression [[scale degree]] refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a "first" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A [[minor scale]]. See the [[musical note]] article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.

The scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms [[tonic (music)|tonic]], [[supertonic]], [[mediant]], [[subdominant]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]], [[submediant]], [[subtonic]]. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the [[leading-tone]] (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) [[Solfège#Movable do solfège|solfège]] naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).

In naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C{{music|sharp}}–D–E–F{{music|sharp}}–G{{music|sharp}} rather than A–B–D{{music|flat}}–D–E–E{{music|doublesharp}}–G{{music|sharp}}. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--Who says it is not possible to name notes with letters of the alphabet following G? German nomenclature, at least, uses eight letters, A through H.--&gt;

Scales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a [[chromatic scale]]. It is assumed that the scale is tuned using [[12-tone equal temperament]] (so that, for instance, C{{Music|sharp}} is the same as D{{Music|flat}}), and that the tonic is in the leftmost position. For example, the [[binary number]] 101011010101, equivalent to the [[decimal number]] 2773, would represent any major scale (such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B). This system includes scales from 100000000000 (2048) to 111111111111 (4095), providing a total of 2048 possible [[Combinatorial species|species]], but only 351 unique scales containing from 1 to 12 notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A more mathematically flexible schema for binary representation, espoused by theorist Ian Ring in his study of musical scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ring |first=Ian |title=A Study of Scales |url=http://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |publisher=Ian Ring |access-date=18 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060403/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has bits representing ascending tones, with the smaller bits representing lower pitches and higher bits representing higher pitches. This causes the bits to appear reversed compared with Duncan's system. Under this schema, a major scale is 101010110101 = (2741), a single root tone is 1, and a chromatic scale is still 111111111111 (4095). All the tone possibilities that begin with a root tone, and are thus scale-like, are odd-numbered.

Scales may also be shown as [[semitones]] from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the [[bass guitar]], scales can be notated in [[tabulature]], an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.

==Transposition and modulation==
{{confusing section|reason=transposition and modulation are different; first sentence introduces yet another term 'transform'; explanation then confuses all these|date=August 2018}}
Composers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the [[C major]] scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or [[transposition (music)|transposed]], a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called "scalar transposition" or "shifting to a new key" and can often be found in [[sequence (music)|musical sequences]] and patterns. (It is D-E-F# in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F#). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some [[Romantic music era]] pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to "remote keys" that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F# major.

==Jazz and blues==
{{See also|Jazz scales}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 6/4
  c4 es f fis g bes c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=A hexatonic [[blues scale]] on C, ascending}}Through the introduction of [[blue note]]s, jazz and [[blues]] employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an [[interval (music)|interval]] that is technically neither [[major and minor|major nor minor]] but "in the middle", giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular [[piano]] cannot play blue notes, but with [[electric guitar]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]] and [[trumpet]], performers can "bend" notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G{{music|sharp}} or a note moving between both. 

In blues, a [[pentatonic scale]] is often used. In jazz, many different [[musical mode|modes]] and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.

==Non-Western scales==
===Equally tempered===
In Western music, scale notes are often separated by [[Equal temperament]] tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave each separating two tones where the higher tone has a oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps. Other traditional tempered scale systems divide the octave to equal intervals by numbers other than 12. Examples are 53 in the [[Middle East]], and 72 in southern [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Other===
Many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. [[Interval (music)|Musical intervals]] are complementary values of the [[harmonic]] [[overtone]]s series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html Explanation of the origin of musical scales clarified by a string division method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824020439/http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html |date=24 August 2012 }} by [[Yuri Landman]] on furious.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from [[Indonesia]] and the [[Indochina]] Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.

===Intra-scale intervals===
Some scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave.

Some scales span part of an octave; Several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these middle eastern scales [[Hejaz scale]] has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while [[Saba scale]], another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.

[[Gamelan]] music uses a small variety of scales including [[Pélog]] and [[Sléndro]], none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. [[Indian classical music]] uses a moveable [[swara|seven-note scale]]. Indian [[Rāga]]s often use intervals smaller than a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edwaard M. 1998. "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning.", p.247. In ''The Psychology of Music'', second edition, edited by Diana Deutsch, 215–64. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-213564-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic music]] [[Arabic maqam|maqamat]] may use [[quarter tone]] intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis [Mahler], Ella. 1973. ''Classical Persian Music: An Introduction''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2014}} In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., [[Śruti (music)|śruti]]) of that same note may be less than a semitone.

'''School-related gender-based violence''' ('''SRGBV''') can be defined as acts or threats of [[Sexual violence|sexual]], [[Violence|physical]] or [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]] happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to [[Gender role|gender norms and stereotypes]]. It can include [[verbal abuse]], [[bullying]], [[sexual abuse]], harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=19, 23-24, 26, 28, 31, 34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For instance, [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] report ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2014. ''Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF. http:// les.unicef.org/publications/ les/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of abuse include:
* Bullying, with one out of three students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide claiming to suffer from this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sexual violence, with one in 10 girls under 20 experiencing such violence. According to the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ), two out of five school directors in Southern and Eastern Africa recognize sexual harassment happened among pupils of their establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO/UNGEI. 2015. ''School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all''. Global Monitoring Report Policy Paper 17, March 2015. Paris, UNESCO. http:// unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also [[corporal punishment]] at school is considered to be a worrying type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, M., Robles, O., Stout, K. and Suvilaakso, T. 2013. ''A Girls’ Rights to Learn without Fear: Working to end Gender-Based Violence at School''. Toronto, Plan Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://plan-international.org/about-&lt;/nowiki&gt; plan/resources/publications/campaigns/a-girl2019s-right-to-learn-without-fear/&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty percent of the children population in the world live in countries where protection against corporal punishment is inexistent (at the legal and at the moral level).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disadvantaged groups are also victims of SRGBV. It has been reported that more than 3000 schoolchildren from Uganda, out of which 24 per cent of girls between 11 and 14 years old suffering from disabilities are victims of sexual violence. 12 per cent of girls who do not suffer from disability are victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Devries, K., Kyegome, N., Zuurmond, M., Parkes, J., Child, J., Walakira, E. and Naker, D. 2014. Violence against primary school children with disabilities in Uganda: a cross-sectional study. ''BMC Public Health'', Vol. 14, p. 1,017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Gay bashing|Homophobic bullying]] is one of the most common forms of bullying. According to research by [[UNESCO]], more than 60 per cent of [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] children in Chile, Mexico and Peru were bullied. More than 55 per cent of self-identified LGBTI students in Thailand communicated they were being bullied; in the United Kingdom, over 90 per cent of secondary school students reported homophobic bullying in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012a. Good Policy and Practice in HIV and Health Education: Education Sector Responses to Homophobic Bullying, Booklet 8. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0021/002164/216493e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Several country-based examples, including New Zealand and Norway show that lesbian, gay and bisexual students are three times more likely to be bullied than heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016.

* [[Cyberbullying|Cyber-bullying]] is also another issue which needs to be resolved. In the US, the majority of victims suffering from cyber-bullying encounter the same problems at school. They are also bullied within their institutions. Girls are more likely to suffer rom cyber-bullying than boys (Schneider et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, S., O’Donnell, L., Stueve, A. and Coulter, R. 2012. Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. ''American Journal of Public Health'', Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171–177.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Root causes&amp;nbsp;==
Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:
* Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, [[Gender role|dominant gender norms]] prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not "proper" and judge them inciting violence against this group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Other factors include [[Economic inequality|income inequality]], as it is a proof of social constraints.  Moreover, [[social media]], [[Child grooming#Over the Internet|online grooming]] and [[Internet troll|trolling]] – also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical health and health risk behaviour outcomes ===
* Injuries, including bruises, burns, fractures, gun wounds and stabbings
* Lacerations and abrasions
* Disability
* Genital-urinary symptoms
* [[Unintended pregnancy|Unwanted pregnancy]]
* [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] including HIV
* [[Eating disorder]]s
* Substance misuse
* Risky sexual behaviour&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mental health outcomes ===
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Anger or hostility
* Low self-esteem
* [[Suicidal ideation|Suicide ideation]], attempts and actual [[suicide]]
* Self-harm
* [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]
* Shame
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]
* Dissociation
* Loss of memory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Educational outcomes ===
* Lack of concentration
* Inability to study
* Falling grades
* Disruption in class
* Non-school attendance
* Dropping out of school&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Challenges of addressing SRGBV ==
Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social cultural norms ===
Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
[[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid. 2004. ''Stop Violence against Girls in Schools''. London, ActionAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Capacity constraints ===
Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms ===
Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak service support for victims ===
Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lack of governance ===
In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limited evidence ===
Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insufficient data and research ===
As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;RTI International. 2016. ''Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied''. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six guiding strategies for national action ==

=== Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform ===
Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:
* developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally
* adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems
* reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive ===
In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level  should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:
* creating safe and welcoming spaces
* ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously
* developing and implementing codes of conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning ===
At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: 
* [[curriculum]] approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality
* training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* safe spaces where co-curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Responses: In and around schools ===
* When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include:
* providing easily accessible, child-sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms
* providing counseling and support
* referral to law enforcement and healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders ===
SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:
* coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level
* partnerships with teachers’ unions
* participation of girls and boys
* working with families and the wider communities
* engaging civil society organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation ===
* National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including:
* formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development
* comprehensive national data collection systems
* indicators to track progress
* evaluations to assess impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Sharks outside cage.jpg|thumb|People shark cage diving, the biggest form of shark tourism]]
'''Shark tourism''' is a form of [[eco-tourism]] rooted in having communities appreciate that local [[shark]] species are more valuable alive than dead.  Instead of opting for a one time economic benefit of harvesting sharks for their body parts, communities are made to assist interested tourists who may want to see live sharks. Many divers and people are involved in interest groups such as the late iDive Sharks Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Inglorious End of iDive Sharks?|url=http://sharkdivers.blogspot.com/2011/07/inglorious-end-of-idive-sharks.html|website=Shark Diver|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aim to celebrate and promote safe and responsible shark diving activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zenato|first1=Christina|title=Shark Diving, Shark Feeding, and Common Sense|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/blogs-news/community-voice/shark-diving-shark-feeding-and-common-sense/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Shark tourism is divided into four main branches:

==Great white shark==
[[File:White shark.jpg|left|thumb|[[Great white shark]] at Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, August 2006. Shot with Nikon D70s in Ikelite housing, in natural light. Animal estimated at 11-12 feet (3.3 to 3.6 m) in length, age unknown]]

Great White Shark viewing is available at the [[Neptune Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shark cage diving|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/enjoy/shark-cage-diving|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[South Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Isla Guadalupe]] in [[Mexico]], and [[New Zealand]]  - where Great White sharks are viewed using shark cages to keep the diver safe. Except for Isla Guadalupe where because of the exceptional visibility underwater more outside the cage diving is done than anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Terry|title=Diving with the Great White Sharks of Guadalupe Island|url=http://news.travel.aol.com/2013/08/05/great-white-shark-diving-guadalupe/|website=AOL Travel|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great White industry was founded in the 1970s by pioneer Australian diver and Great White attack survivor [[Rodney Fox]] in South Australia. He was the sole world-wide operator until the South African industry was founded in early 1989 by Pieter van der Walt. He was joined shortly thereafter by pioneer diver and underwater photographer George Askew who handled promotions and put South African cage diving "on the map" with the publicity he got - until they split in Jan 1992, after they, together with famous Australian divers, [[Ron and Valerie Taylor]], did the world's first dive amongst Great White sharks without a cage and completely unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=David Seifert|first1=Douglas|title=A tribute to Ron Taylor|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/blogs-news/community-voice/a-tribute-to-ron-taylor/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This  'Frontier Pushing' dive was directly responsible for the upsurge in Shark Tourism – esp free-diving (i.e. Out of cage) swimming with big sharks. When would be operators around the world became aware of these four mad people who proved that the Great White was quite approachable and not likely to attack – thought that then maybe all the other 'Bad Boy' sharks like Tigers, Bulls and Oceanic's were safe to swim with too. This proved to be the case and shark tourism has become a multi-million-dollar a year industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecotourism: Dollars and Sense|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/education/the-value-of-sharks/sharks-and-ecotourism/|website=sharksavers.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiger, bull and oceanic white tip==
The [[Bahamas]] is a favorite region for Category 2 sharks.   
Whilst divers in the Bahamas experience [[Caribbean reef shark|Reef Shark]]s and [[Tiger shark|Tiger Sharks]] while they are hand-fed. Isla Guadalupe located in [[Mexico]] has been named a Bio-Sphere Reserve in an effort to control the shark diving activities there. Although the practice of shark diving proves to be controversial, it has been proven very effective in attracting tourists. [[Whale shark|Whale Sharks]], while not traditionally harvested for their fins but are sometimes harvested for their meat, have also benefited from Shark Tourism because of [[snorkeler]]s getting into the water with the gentle giants. In the [[Philippines]] snorkelers must maintain a distance of four feet from the sharks and there is a fine and possible jail time for anyone who touches the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cannon|first1=Marisa|title=Swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/05/travel/whale-shark-oslob/index.html|website=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All manner of Reef Shark species are prevalent at the many shark feeding dives within the Pacific Region. Grey Reef sharks are the main diners in places such as the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Tahiti]]. Silvertips and Black Tips Reef Sharks tend to be more seen around the PNG coastlines. Bull Sharks are around Mexico, [[Playa del Carmen]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Der Haar|first1=Nils|title=Why not to Bull Shark Dive in Play Del Carmen|url=http://scubadiverlife.com/2013/03/22/why-not-to-bull-shark-dive-in-play-del-carmen/|website=Scuba Diver Life|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation benefits==
Passive and active forms of shark tourism are believed to conserve the species by generating commercial value to their lives in the natural world. In [[North Carolina]] wreck divers regularly visit the [[World War II]] [[shipwrecks]] to dive with the [[Sand Tiger]] sharks that make the wrecks their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Robert|title=Ghosts in the Graveyard: N.C.

==Feeding==
Tourism providers often [[Do not feed the animals|provide food]] to attract sharks to areas where they can be more easily viewed, although this is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Higham|first1=James|last2=Lück|first2=Michael |title=Marine Wildlife and Tourism Management: Insights from the Natural and Social Sciences|year=2008|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-1-84593-345-6|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsRZW0dU-6MC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] and the states of Hawaii and Florida shark feeding is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |title=Environmental Status: Sharks and rays: Response: tourism |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411143054/http://kurrawa.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/sotr/sharks_rays/response.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii had several issues with the banning of shark feeding. The initial law that prohibited it was passed in 2002, but many locals realized the tour companies were not following this law and pushed for stricter enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530173/Hawaii-s-shark-tours-persist-despite-laws-against-feeding.html?nav=5031|title=Hawaii’s shark tours persist despite laws against feeding - Mauinews.com {{!}} News, Sports, Jobs, Visitor's Information - The Maui News|website=mauinews.com|access-date=2016-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602095044/http://mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530173/Hawaii-s-shark-tours-persist-despite-laws-against-feeding.html?nav=5031|archivedate=2016-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shark tourism in Hawaii ==
[[File:Linving in a shark-eat-shark world 150617-M-RT812-001.jpg|thumb|A sign at Pyramid Rock Beach in [[Hawaii]] warning about a shark sighting, 2015]]
[[Shark]]s, or "mano" as they are called by the local Hawaiians, are viewed as sacred. Early Hawaiians worshiped and protected the sharks which they saw as family gods or "aumaka".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Sep/28/il/il06a.html.|title=The Honolulu Advertiser - Island Life|website=the.honoluluadvertiser.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, shark cage diving has become a very profitable tourist attraction in the state. [[Native Hawaiians]] were not pleased with this at first due to the fact that the companies were luring in the sharks using bait; they viewed these animals as sacred and feeding them for entertainment was said to be unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKwBKmwy7EEC|title=Sharks of Hawaii: Their Biology and Cultural Significance|last=Taylor|first=Leighton R.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824815622|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also speculations that by feeding them, the sharks would begin to associate the boats and humans with food. For this reason, a bill was passed in [[Hawaii]] in 2002 that banned the feeding of sharks in state waters, which is about 3 miles off shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://policy.mofcom.gov.cn/GlobalLaw/english/flaw!fetch.action?id=b4c36fac-1f55-4cb8-910e-c6d11dc60f8b&amp;pager.pageNo=1#hawaii-volume-03-title-12-chapter-188-hrs-0188-0040-0006-htm.|title=Global Law and Regulation|website=policy.mofcom.gov.cn|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ningaloo Marine Park==
[[Ningaloo Marine Park (state waters)|Ningaloo Marine Park]] in [[Western Australia]] is the site of an annual whale shark aggregation. This site is a very popular tourist site, as whale sharks are incredibly gentle creatures that pose very little threat to humans. Introduced in 1997 and revised to its current version in 2013, the [[Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)|Department of Parks and Wildlife]] is responsible for a whale shark management program designed to protect the whale shark species and regulate human interaction with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/images/documents/conservation-management/marine/20130277_Whale_Shark_management_-_Ningaloo_FINAL_small.pdf|title=Whale shark management with particular  reference to Ningaloo Marine Park|last=Parks and Wildlife|first=Department of|date=October 2013|website=www.dpaw.wa.gov.au|access-date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensing ===
The shark tourism industry is meant to educate and increase awareness of the natural environment as well as generate profits for the local people. The whale shark management program of Ningaloo Marine Park relies on the ''Conservation and Land Management Act of 1984'' (CALM Act) and the ''Wildlife Conservation Act of 1950''. The CALM Act requires tour operators to obtain a commercial tourist activity licence, and the Wildlife Conservation Act requires a wildlife interaction licence for each protected species a tour may come in contact with. This includes the whale sharks but is not limited to whales, other shark species, and [[dugong]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Techera, Erika J., and Natalie Klein. “The Role of Law in Shark-Based Eco-Tourism: Lessons from Australia.” ''Marine Policy'', vol. 39, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these laws, the Western Australian government is able to regulate how tourists interact with whale sharks and to what extent. A maximum of 15 operators are allowed to obtain licences at a given time. In addition, only one tour vessel is allowed to travel to the whale sharks while the rest must stay 250 metres away. Only ten swimmers are allowed in the water at a time, which controls the crowding of the area, and tourists are prohibited from feeding or touching the whale sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Derrin. “Whale Shark Tourism in Ningaloo Marine Park, Australia.” ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals'', vol. 11, no. 1, Jan. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Whale sharks are considered a vulnerable species and have been targeted by fishermen for many years. In Ningaloo Marine Park, they are entirely protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://support.iucnredlist.org/species/whale-shark|title=Discover the Whale Shark!|date=2014-07-23|work=IUCN Red List 50|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whale sharks in the area are considered highly valuable in the ecotourism industry, as the industry provides numerous jobs to local people and brings in $12 million USD annually. Tourist interest in wildlife tourism continues to grow, and the whale shark tourism industry is expected to increase through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259434808_Global_economic_value_of_shark_ecotourism_Implications_for_conservation|title=Global economic value of shark ecotourism: Implications for conservation (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''Steklov Institute of Mathematics''' or '''Steklov Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Математический институт имени В.А.Стеклова}}) is a premier research institute based in [[Moscow]], specialized in [[mathematics]], and a part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The institute is named after [[Vladimir Andreevich Steklov]], who in 1919 founded the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in  [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. In 1934, this institute was split into separate parts for physics and mathematics, and the mathematical part became the Steklov Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|first=Yakov|last=Sinai|authorlink=Yakov Sinai|publisher=World Scientific|year=2003|isbn=9789812383853|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC&amp;pg=PA38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it was moved to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, pp. 530 and 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first director of the Steklov Institute was [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961-1964, the institute's director was the notable mathematician [[Sergei Chernikov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ershov|first1=Y.L. et al.|title=Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov (obituary)|journal=Russian Math. Surveys|date=1988|volume=43|issue=2|pages=153–155|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/RM1988v043n02ABEH001714/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old building of the Institute in Leningrad became its Department in Leningrad. Today, that department has become a separate institute, called the ''[[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences]]'' or '''PDMI RAS''', located in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The name ''St. Petersburg Department'' is misleading, however, because the St. Petersburg Department is now an independent institute. In 1966, the Moscow-based [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) split off from the Steklov Institute.

'''Street prostitution''' is a form of [[sex work]] in which a [[sex worker]] [[solicitation|solicits]] customers from a public place, most commonly a street, while waiting at street corners or walking alongside a street, but also other public places such as parks, benches, etc. The street prostitute is often dressed in a provocative manner. The sex act may be performed in the customer's car or in a nearby secluded street location, or at the prostitute's residence or in a rented [[motel]] room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harcourt|first1=Christine|last2=Donovan|first2=Basil|title=The Many Faces of Sex Work|url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000096|website=ProCon|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

Street prostitution is often illegal, even in jurisdictions that allow other forms of [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name="homeoffice" /&gt;

It is estimated that only 10-20 percent of sex workers are working in the streets; however, it is also estimated that 90 percent of the arrests of prostitutes are of street workers. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Ann|title=Race, Class, Gender, and Deviancy: The Criminalization of Prostitution|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice|date=September 2013|volume=10|issue=1|pages=48–49|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&amp;context=bglj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions where prostitution itself is legal, such as in [[Prostitution in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], street prostitution has been made illegal.&lt;ref&gt;S. 1(1) of the [[Street Offences Act 1959]] as amended by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/26/section/16 section 16] of the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions also outlaw [[kerb crawler|kerb crawling]], slowly driving around with the intent to procure the services of a prostitute.

In [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]], in [[New South Wales]] it is legal to solicit on the streets, except in some areas (such as near schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|soa1988189|Summary Offences Act 1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other [[Australia|Australian]] states and territories prohibit street solicitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|act|soa1953189|Summary Offences Act 1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although some of these jurisdictions allow licensed brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|swa1994129|Sex Work Act 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Street prostitution is legal in [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html|title=Prostitution Reform Act 2003|author=|date=|website=legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Prostitution in Germany|Germany]] it is allowed too, but cities can restrict it to certain areas or hours (regulations vary widely from place to place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Joel|last2=Ben|first2=Clissitt|title=Welcome to Paradise|url=http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/welcome-to-paradise/|website=Telegraph|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Prostitution in the United States|United States]], street prostitution is illegal in all 50 states; 49 of the states outlaw all forms of prostitution; Nevada allows licensed brothels, but only in some rural areas, not in the major metropolitan areas (only 8 counties have active brothels and prostitution outside these brothels is illegal throughout the state).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hance|first1=Danielle|title=14 Surprising Facts About Prostitution In America|url=https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/11-surprising-facts-about-american-prostitution/|website=The Richest|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In four towns in the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], a special zone (''tippelzone'') is designated for legal street prostitution.&lt;ref name="soaaids" /&gt; The zone is often in a [[business park]], to avoid inconvenience for residents and can include a [[sex drive-in]] (afwerkplek).&lt;ref name="1986-one"&gt;(18 August 2008). [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1039/Utrecht/article/detail/2180195/2008/11/18/Onderzoek-naar-ruimere-afwerkplek.dhtml Onderzoek naar ruimere afwerkplek], ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'' (in Dutch) (article states prostitutes are reporting that the stalls in the Utrecht facility are too small for some luxury cars and SUVs, as the facility has remained mostly unchanged since its construction in 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of the zones the prostitutes need a [[licence]].&lt;ref name="soaaids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Street prostitution|url=https://www.soaaids.nl/en/prostitution/in-the-Netherlands/workplaces/street-prostitution|website=Soa Aids Nederland|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and research==
Street prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to physical and sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/gender/documents/sexworkers.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to muggings, by clients and [[pimp]]s. 

The [[World Health Organization]] reported that a study in Bangladesh found that between 50% and 60% of street based prostitutes had been raped by men in uniform and between 40% and 50% had been raped by local clients.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

[[Melissa Farley]]'s study of 854 prostitutes in nine countries, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, United States, and Zambia, found that 95% of women had been physically assaulted, and 75% had been raped. 89% of the women interviewed stated that they wanted to leave prostitution.&lt;ref name="farley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Cotton|first2=Ann|last3=Lynne|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Zumbeck|first4=Sybille|last5=Spiwak|first5=Frida|last6=Reyes|first6=Maria E.|last7=Alvarez|first7=Dinorah|last8=Sezgin|first8=Ufuk|title=Prostitution and Trafficking in Nine Countries|journal=Journal of Trauma Practice|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=33–74|doi=10.1300/j189v02n03_03|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the methodology and neutrality of Farley's studies has been criticised by other academics such as [[Ronald Weitzer]].&lt;ref name=weitzer1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weitzer |first=Ronald |author-link=Ronald Weitzer |title=Flawed theory and method in studies of prostitution |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=934–949 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1177/1077801205276986 |pmid=16043578 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612131628/http://www.woodhullfoundation.org/content/otherpublications/WeitzerVAW-1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Weitzer has also said that Farley's findings are heavily influenced by [[radical feminist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzer, R. "Flawed theory and method in studies of prostitution" (above-cited); 
:"''The articles in question are by Jody Raphael and Deborah Shapiro (2004), Melissa Farley (2004), and Janice Raymond (2004). At least two of the authors (Farley and Raymond) are activists involved in the anti-prostitution campaign. [...] The three articles are only the most recent examples in a long line of writings on the sex industry by authors who adopt an extreme version of radical feminist theory—extreme in the sense that it is absolutist, doctrinaire, and unscientific.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Ann | title = Letter to Ambassador John Miller | publisher = Center for Health and Gender Equity | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090117134544/http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/LtrMillerTrafficking.pdf | archive-date = 17 January 2009 | url = http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/LtrMillerTrafficking.pdf | date =  21 April  2005 | page = 4 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study of [[Chicago|Chicago, USA]] street prostitutes, economists [[Steven D. Levitt]] and [[Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh]] found that women working without pimps work for an average hourly rate of about $25, and those working with pimps make 50% more. This is roughly four times the wage of other jobs available to them. Prostitutes are arrested once for every 450 encounters and every 10th arrest results in jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/apr09/4.aspx|title=Trading Tricks: The Economics of Prostitution|author=Steven D. Levitt|date=April 2009|publisher=The University of Chicago Booth School of Business|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a study in the UK showed that up to 95% of women in street prostitution were problematic drug users, including around 78% heroin users and rising numbers of [[crack cocaine]] addicts.&lt;ref name="homeoffice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paying the Price: a consultation paper on prostitution|url=https://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/paying_the_price.pdf|publisher=UK Home Office|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assen : Van Gorcum, 1995. {{ISBN|90-232-3013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work == 
De Sitter is best known for introducing the sociotechnical system approach in the Netherlands. This approach involves redesign of organization and change management theory, which was initially developed at the British [[Tavistock Institute]] in the late 1950s. De Sitter combined in his work the systems theory fundamentals of the Delft Systems Approach, developed by [[Jan in 't Veld]] and [[Pierre Malotaux]]. With scientists as [[Björn Gustavsen]], [[Fred Emery]], [[Eric Trist]], De Sitter is considered among the foremost social systems scientists in their field.&lt;ref name="FvE 2011"/&gt;

=== Modern socio-technology (MST) ===
Benders et al. (2010) recalled the development of socio-technical systems design since its initiation at the British coal mines in the late 1940s, and the development of Modern Socio-technology (MST) by De Sitter and others:

:''In 1951, Trist and Bamforth published a founding article on STSD while the London-based Tavistock Institute played a key role in further developing socio-technical design into practical applications. During the 1950s and 1960s these notions were picked up in many countries, with Norwegian and Swedish researchers playing key roles. In the Netherlands a strand of socio-technical scholars and practitioners developed a widely accepted research based organizational design methodology (De Sitter, Den Hertog, &amp; Dankbaar, 1997; De Sitter, 1998). This Dutch variant, called Modern Socio-technology (MST), builds on the classic STSD. In the 1970s Ulbo de Sitter played a key role in developing this socio-technical systems theory (with some roots in German sociology). During the 1980s this design theory was enriched with a proper design methodology based on action research...''&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"&gt;Benders, J. G. J. M., et al. "[http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/661125/roelschoutetenarticle_1.pdf A modern socio-technical view on ERP-systems]." Social computing: Concepts, methodologies, tools, and applications (2010): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;
And furthermore specifically about Modern Socio-technology (MST):

:''Modern Socio-technology (MST) mainly differs from STSD by its integral approach. Whereas classic STSD provides a set of static and partial design principles, MST offers detailed structural principles in terms of design content, while at the same time specifying a theory of change by means of worker participation and training (Van Eijnatten, 1993). To emphasize the integral character of this approach, Van Eijnatten and Van der Zwaan (1998) labeled it Integral Organizational Renewal (IOR)."&lt;ref name = "Ben et al. 2010"/&gt;

==History==

Early in the 20th century, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] began offering grants to change the direction of library education and scholarship. Of particular interest was the creation of an institution analogous to the [[Harvard Law School]] or the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].  The result was a sensation: the 1926 endowment of a research-oriented program offering only the [[Ph.D. degree]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Documentation, Information Science and Library Science in the USA." ''Information Processing and Management'' 32, no. 1 (1996): 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt; With an emphasis on investigation fostered among students, studies conducted and conferences held at GLS provided a center for intellectual inquiry in the development of 20th century [[library science|librarianship]].  ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', a scholarly journal focused on research, was launched in 1931 to provide an outlet for the publication of rigorous research.

==Structure and focus==

The Graduate Library School (GLS) at the [[University of Chicago]] changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. Funded by the Carnegie Corporation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = F. P. Keppel | title = The Carnegie Corporation and the Graduate Library School: A Historical Outline | journal = The Library Quarterly | year = 1931 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–25 | jstor = 40039626 | doi=10.1086/612840}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GLS set forth policies to establish an institution to educate students imbued with the spirit of investigation. Prior to establishment of the GLS education for librarians had been an apprenticeship model.&lt;ref&gt;Shera, Jesse Hauk. 1972. The foundations of education for librarianship. New York: Becker and Hayes.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Waples wrote of the policies that would differentiate  “The Graduate Library School at Chicago” from schools in the apprenticeship mode.

John V. Richardson, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J.V. (1982). ''The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library School at Chicago'', 1921-
51. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; has written of the establishment and the first 30 years of the GLS in ''The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library School at Chicago, 1921–51.''

Joyce M. Latham has written of the role of GLS faculty in the development of the Chicago Public Library noting "In their final report on the status of CPL, ''A Metropolitan Library in Action'', [[Carleton B. Joeckel]] and [[Leon Carnovsky]] devoted significant attention to the role
of the public library in adult education." &lt;ref&gt;Latham, J. M. (2011). Memorial Day to Memorial Library: The South Chicago Branch Library as cultural terrain, 1937–1947. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 46(3), 321–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty of the GLS were innovators in the use of computers for library functions. In 1982 Don Swanson described the Microsystem for Interactive Bibliographic Searching (MIRABILIS) for the general library community in ''Library Journal'' &lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Don R. 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">The '''Washington Accord''' is an international accreditation agreement for professional [[engineering]] [[academic degree]]s between the bodies responsible for accreditation in its signatory countries. Established in 1989, the full signatories as of 2018 are [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Taiwan]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Philippines]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Signatories&gt;{{cite web| title=Washington Accord| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/| publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement recognizes that there is substantial equivalence of programs accredited by those signatories. Graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries are recognized by the other signatory countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering. Recognition of accredited programs is not retroactive but takes effect only from the date of admission of the country to signatory status.

==Scope==
The Washington Accord covers undergraduate engineering degrees under [[Outcome-based education]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utar.edu.my/fes/file/OBE.pdf| title=Outcome Based Education| date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering technology]] and [[postgraduate]] engineering programs are not covered by the accord. Engineering technology programs are covered under the [[Sydney Accord]] and [[Dublin Accord]]. Only qualifications awarded after the signatory country or region became part of the Washington Accord are recognized. The accord is not directly responsible for the licensing  of [[Professional Engineer]]s and the registration of [[Chartered Engineer]]s, but it does cover the academic requirements that are part of the licensing processes in signatory countries.

[[File:2012-05-28 Fotoflug Cuxhaven Wilhelmshaven DSCF9867 (crop).jpg|thumb|Wastewater treatment plant in [[Cuxhaven]], Germany]]

'''Wastewater treatment''' is a process used to convert [[wastewater]] into an [[effluent]] that can be returned to the [[water cycle]] with minimum impact on the environment, or directly reused. The latter is called [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]] because treated wastewater can then be used for other purposes. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), often referred to as a Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) or a [[sewage treatment plant]].  Pollutants in municipal wastewater (households and small industries) are removed or broken down.

The treatment of wastewater is part of the overarching field of [[sanitation]]. Sanitation also includes the management of [[human waste]] and [[solid waste]] as well as [[stormwater]] (drainage) management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/sanitation/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Health topics |title=Sanitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; By-products from wastewater treatment plants, such as screenings, grit and [[sewage sludge]] may also be treated in a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |title = Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition = 4th |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.14}}

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Disposal or reuse==
Although disposal or [[reuse]] occurs after treatment, it must be considered first. Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment, disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary with the type of use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal, but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. Ocean disposal is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders. Water bodies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation may be subject to regulations of multiple local governments. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary widely among different jurisdictions for disposal of wastewater to [[evaporation pond]]s, [[infiltration basin]]s, or [[injection well]]s.

== Processes used ==



===Phase separation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1002-002, Güstrow, Zuckerwerk, Klärwerk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Clarifier]]s are widely used for wastewater treatment.]]
Phase separation transfers impurities into a [[non-aqueous phase liquid|non-aqueous phase]]. Phase separation may occur at intermediate points in a treatment sequence to remove solids generated during [[oxidation]] or polishing. Grease and oil may be recovered for fuel or [[saponification]]. Solids often require [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]] in a [[wastewater treatment plant]]. Disposal options for dried solids vary with the type and concentration of impurities removed from water.

Production of [[brine|waste brine]], however, may discourage wastewater treatment removing dissolved inorganic solids from water by methods like [[ion exchange]], [[reverse osmosis]], and [[distillation]]. 
[[File:Vorklärung - primary settling tank (12359073495).jpg|thumb|Primary settling tank of wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Sedimentation====
{{further|Sedimentation (water treatment)}}
[[Solid]]s and [[non-polar]] [[liquid]]s may be removed from wastewater by [[gravity]] when [[density]] differences are sufficient to overcome dispersion by [[turbulence]]. [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|Gravity separation]] of solids is the primary treatment of [[sewage]], where the unit process is called "primary settling tanks" or "primary sedimentation tanks". It is also widely used for the treatment of other wastewaters. Solids that are heavier than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent [[settling basin]]s. More complex [[clarifier]]s also have skimmers to simultaneously remove floating grease like soap scum and solids like feathers or wood chips. Containers like the [[API oil-water separator]] are specifically designed to separate non-polar liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.111-138&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filtration====

[[Colloid]]al suspensions of fine solids may be removed by [[filtration]] through fine physical barriers distinguished from coarser screens or [[sieve]]s by the ability to remove particles smaller than the openings through which the water passes. Other types of [[water filter]]s remove impurities by chemical or biological processes described below.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.139-196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation===
Oxidation reduces the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater, and may reduce the toxicity of some impurities. [[Secondary treatment]] converts organic compounds into [[carbon dioxide]], water, and [[biosolids]]. Chemical oxidation is widely used for disinfection.
[[File:Belebungsbecken - aeration tank (12359229313).jpg|thumb|Aeration tank of an [[activated sludge]] process at the wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Biochemical oxidation====
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
Secondary treatment by [[biochemical]] oxidation of dissolved and colloidal [[organic compound]]s is widely used in [[sewage treatment]] and is applicable to some agricultural and industrial wastewaters. Biological oxidation will preferentially remove organic compounds useful as a food supply for the treatment [[ecosystem]].  Concentration of some less digestible compounds may be reduced by [[co-metabolism]]. Removal efficiency is limited by the minimum food concentration required to sustain the treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp. 477–521&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical oxidation====
{{main|Redox}}
Chemical oxidation may remove some [[persistent organic pollutant]]s and concentrations remaining after biochemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.363-408&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection by chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial [[pathogen]]s by adding [[ozone]], [[Water chlorination|chlorine or hypochlorite]] to wastewater.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1220}}

===Polishing===
Polishing refers to treatments made following the above methods. These treatments may also be used independently for some industrial wastewater. [[Chemical reduction]] or [[pH]] adjustment minimizes chemical reactivity of wastewater following chemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon filtering]] removes remaining contaminants and impurities by chemical absorption onto activated carbon.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1138}} Filtration through sand (calcium carbonate) or fabric filters is the most common method used in municipal wastewater treatment.

== Wastewater treatment plants ==
&lt;!--[[Wastewater treatment plant]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
{{For|[[plant]] species utilized in water treatment|Organisms involved in water purification}}
Wastewater treatment plants may be distinguished by the type of wastewater to be treated, i.e. whether it is sewage, industrial wastewater, agricultural wastewater or leachate.
[[File:WWTP Antwerpen-Zuid.jpg|thumb|Overview of the wastewater treatment plant of Antwerpen-Zuid, located in the south of the agglomeration of Antwerp (Belgium)]]

===Sewage treatment plants===
{{main|Sewage treatment plant}}
A typical municipal sewage treatment plant in an industrialized country may include primary treatment to remove solid material, [[secondary treatment]] to digest dissolved and suspended organic material as well as the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and – sometimes but not always – disinfection to kill [[pathogenic bacteria]]. The [[sewage sludge]] that is produced in sewage treatment plants undergoes [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]]. Larger municipalities often include factories discharging industrial wastewater into the municipal sewer system. The term "sewage treatment plant" is now often replaced with the term "wastewater treatment plant".&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt; Sewage can also be treated by processes using "[[Nature-based solutions]]". 

==== Tertiary treatment ====
{{Main|Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment}}
Tertiary treatment is a term applied to polishing methods used following a traditional sewage treatment sequence. Tertiary treatment is being increasingly applied in industrialized countries and most common technologies are [[micro filtration]] or [[synthetic membranes]]. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is nearly indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its minerals). [[Nitrate]]s can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but also via microbial [[denitrification]]. Ozone wastewater treatment is also growing in popularity, and requires the use of an [[ozone generator]], which decontaminates the water as [[ozone]] bubbles percolate through the tank, but this treatment is energy intensive. The latest, and very promising treatment technology is the use [[aerobic granulation]].

===Industrial wastewater treatment plants===

[[File:ČOV Boletice - ústí přečištěné vody do Labe.jpg|thumb|Treated water drained to the [[Elbe river]], [[Děčín]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
Disposal of wastewaters from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly problem. Most [[petroleum refineries]], chemical and [[petrochemical]] plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=1st |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1967 |id=[[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1412}} have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the local and/or national regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into community treatment plants or into rivers, lakes or oceans. [[Constructed wetland]]s are being used in an increasing number of cases as they provided high quality and productive on-site treatment. Other industrial processes that produce a lot of waste-waters such as [[paper and pulp production]] has created environmental concern, leading to development of processes to recycle water use within plants before they have to be cleaned and disposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byrd |first1=J.F. |last2=Ehrke |first2=M.D. |last3=Whitfield |first3=J.I. |date=April 1984 |title=New Bleached Kraft Pulp Plant in Georgia: State of the Art Environmental Control |url= |journal=Journal ''(Water Pollution Control Federation)'' |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=378–385 |doi= |jstor=25042250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial wastewater treatment plants are required where municipal sewage treatment plants are unavailable or cannot adequately treat specific industrial wastewaters. Industrial wastewater plants may reduce raw water costs by converting selected wastewaters to reclaimed water used for different purposes. Industrial wastewater treatment plants may reduce wastewater treatment charges collected by municipal sewage treatment plants by pre-treating wastewaters to reduce concentrations of pollutants measured to determine user fees.&lt;ref name="mjh"&gt;Hammer, pp.300-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[economies of scale]] may favor use of a large municipal sewage treatment plant for disposal of small volumes of industrial wastewater, industrial wastewater treatment and disposal may be less expensive than correctly apportioned costs for larger volumes of industrial wastewater not requiring the conventional sewage treatment sequence of a small municipal sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, pp.40-4-40-11&lt;/ref&gt;

An industrial wastewater treatment plant may include one or more of the following rather than the conventional primary, secondary, and disinfection sequence of sewage treatment:
* An [[API oil-water separator]], for removing separate phase oil from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[clarifier]], for removing solids from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.41-15&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[trickling filter|roughing filter]], to reduce the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.23-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[carbon filtration]] plant, to remove toxic dissolved organic compounds from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advanced [[electrodialysis reversal |electrodialysis reversal (EDR)]] system with [[ion exchange membranes]].

===Agricultural wastewater treatment plants===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
[[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for continuous confined animal operations like milk and egg production may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units similar to those described under industrial wastewater; but where land is available for ponds, [[settling basin]]s and [[facultative lagoon]]s may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding or harvest cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leachate treatment plants ===
[[Leachate]] treatment plants are used to treat leachate from [[landfill]]s. Treatment options include: biological treatment, mechanical treatment by [[ultrafiltration]], treatment with [[Active Carbon|active carbon]] filters and reverse osmosis using disc tube module technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6864">'''Wonderbag''' is a stand-alone, non-electric insulated bag designed to reduce the amount of [[fuel]] required in the [[cooking]] of food in [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt; Instead of being placed on a [[stove]] for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of [[thermal insulation]] to continue cooking, and keeps food warm without needing additional fire or heat.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;  Working on the principle of [[thermal cooking]], the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with [[Kerosene]] ("paraffin") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease [[deforestation]] of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel.&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

Designed by [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]-based entrepreneur Sarah Collins of Natural Balance, and [[poverty]] activist Moshy Mathe, the Wonderbag is aimed at societies where fuel is expensive or time-consuming to gather.

As of January 2012, over 150,000 Wonderbags were in use in South Africa, with the manufacturers and partners such as [[Unilever]] intending to promote the use of the device worldwide.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; {{As of|January 2013}} over 650,000 have been distributed in "South Africa, [[Rwanda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Syria]]n refugee camps in [[Jordan]]."&lt;ref name=sfchr/&gt;

== History ==
Sarah Collins developed the idea for the Wonderbag during power outages in South Africa in 2008.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

Anna Pearce describes in her book "Simply Living - The Story of the Compassion and the Wonderbox" from 1989 how the old idea of the hayboxes turned into polystyrene filled cushions - The Wonderbox - to cook in South Africa ({{ISBN|1 85421 048 3}}) Wonderboxes were also distributed beginning as early as 1976, while not a new invention, the wonderbag is an innovative take on an old design.

The original Wonderbox was designed and produced by Shirley Buys (nee' Woodbridge) in Durban in 1976, based upon the Hay Box design used in her childhood in war-time England. Shirley trained as a patternmaker and designed the inverted oversized 'beanbag' containing recycled polystyrene chips in a polyester-cotton fabric bag and lid within a corrugated cardboard box and personally marketed it across Zululand between 1976 and 1980. Compassion of South Africa, a non-sectarian Christian action group opposing Apartheid, and the particular assistance from Brigid Oppenheimer facilitated Shirley's design and marketing and published a comprehensive recipe book &lt;ref&gt;https://thermalcooker.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/wonder-box-recipe-booklet/&lt;/ref&gt;with a lot of graphics to help illiterate users follow the recipes.&lt;ref&gt;http://foodstorageandsurvival.com/building-a-wonderbox-style-insulated-cooking-box&lt;/ref&gt; The design was deliberately not patented and Compassion of South Africa asked to be recognised in the sharing of the recipe book.  Shirley manufactured the Wonderbox in her workshop in her Morningside Durban home for over 3 years before Compassion established several other manufacturing facilities across South African, and shared the design freely. 

== Design ==
The Wonderbag consists of an inner layer of insulation containing recycled [[polystyrene]] balls, with an outer, [[drawstring]]&lt;ref name="Metro" /&gt; covering of polyester-cotton blend textiles.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt; The manufacturers expect that in time the polystyrene (which is non-[[Biodegradation|biodegradeable]]) will be replaced with a [[polyurethane]] blend.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Use ==
To use the Wonderbag, first a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] is heated as normal on a stove until it reaches the required cooking temperature. At this point, the pot is removed from the stove and placed in the bag, where due to the insulation the receptacle remains near the stovetop temperature for an extended period. Rice, for instance, may be cooked by heating in a pot of water for two minutes until the water boils and then placing in the Wonderbag for another hour, while for a meat dish the stovetop time is twenty minutes and the bag time five hours.&lt;ref name="psfk" /&gt;

== Fuel savings ==
Due to the reduction in fuel used, the Wonderbag is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to half a ton per year if used three times a week.&lt;ref name="Lean2011" /&gt;

== Retail and production ==
The Wonderbag is available in the United States.
